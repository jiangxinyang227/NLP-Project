with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj ive started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mjs feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad mkayvisually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of himthe actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pescis character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mjs musiclots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scenebottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mjs bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention ive gave this subjecthmmm well i dont know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter
the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year eg the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important baseslike being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to hg wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings
the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna like ¨jurassik park¨ and some scientists resurrect one of natures most fearsome predators the sabretooth tiger or smilodon scientific ambition turns deadly however and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors tourists and scientificmeanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger in addition a security agent stacy haiduk and her mate brian wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons the sabretooths themselves of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one natures most fearsome predators furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victimsthe movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hair-raising chillsfull of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effectsthe story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming foodactors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts runningbound and leaps or dangling over walls and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realisticgory and violent attack scenes other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following : ¨sabretooth2002¨by james r hickox with vanessa angel david keith and john rhys davies and the much better ¨10000 bc2006¨ by roland emmerich with with steven strait cliff curtis and camilla belle this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films miller is an australian director usually working for television tidal wave journey to the center of the earth and many others and occasionally for cinema the man from snowy river zeus and roxannerobinson crusoe rating : below average bottom of barrel
it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didnt i read somewhere either dont care for opera dont care for wagner or dont care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagners swan-song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the textits questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagners text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music -- in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i cant think why syberberg couldnt splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of musicthe sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the 1951 bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film
superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80s exploitation hooray! the pre-credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that were dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later were up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist-fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity! bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sisters naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesnt mind at all sick dude! anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off 20 years later theyre facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue whos beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever! the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and i wont reveal for what reason  bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bos principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film theres the obligatory were-falling-in-love montage and loads of other attractions! my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie: none!
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool 45
this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so-so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasnt so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie
i watched this video at a friends house im glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups most not related to manned flight sibrels smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
a friend of mine bought this film for £1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girlsadam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ships resident comedian - the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea sandlers character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead hes rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sickperhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time
this movie is full of references like mad max ii the wild one and many others the ladybug´s face it´s a clear reference or tribute to peter lorre this movie is a masterpiece we´ll talk much more about in the future
what happens when an army of wetbacks towelheads and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their butts of course another laughable example of reagan-era cultural fallout bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala
although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time; this film is an exception i didnt actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparisonthe story and the way it is written is no question: it is capote there is no need for more wordsthe play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number 1 famous star and not her brother this time this certainty is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr edwards is clearly the top of all their professioni recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your dvd shelves
mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spallwhile we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spalls range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertorywhile an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brooks script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into actswere introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldnt tell if this is a private or public school as they gather  the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisors role than the martinets she usually has to playa break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but its much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the us over christmasnathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harveys redemption that could have been played for movie-of-the-week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercialswhile it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than ive seen in most holiday-themed tv movies
i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldnt be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish its nothing more than a b or c-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designerlike the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plots actually ok for a sg flickill never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgivenesstoo bad - i miss kelly lebrock--jimbo
note to george litman and others: the mystery science theater 3000 riff is i dont think so *breeder*my favorite riff is why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not! over all i would say we must give credit to the mst3k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie you really cant make much fun of the dialog; bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do betteri would recommend that you buy a book and read hamlet
stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family newcomers to rural maine find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father dale midkiff then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection - only of course anything buried there comes back not quite rightbelow average horror picture starts out clumsy insulting and inept and continues that way for a while with the absolute worst element being midkiffs worthless performance it gets a little better toward the end with genuinely disturbing finale in point of fact the whole movie is really disturbing which is why i cant completely dismiss it - at least it has something to make it memorable decent supporting performances by fred gwynne as the wise old aged neighbor and brad greenquist as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem filmking has his usual cameo as the ministerfollowed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert is it any wonder that shes had no mainstream film work since410
`the matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `twilight zone-ish manner the general rule applies here- and this sequel doesnt match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesnt even compare with it`reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nose-dives after a disastrous first 45 minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong `zion rave scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but its also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance musicthe bullet-time aspect of `the matrix was a good addition but in `reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that `the matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `star wars saga havethe acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo weavings `agent smith- the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress a poor thrown-together movie `the matrix reloaded is a disappointment those who didnt like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this ones for die-hard fans only even in the movies own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating: 4510
ulli lommels 1980 film the boogey man is no classic but its an above average low budget chiller thats worth a look the sequel 1983s boogey man ii is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least its an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldnt have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled return of the boogey man when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for iti should have known better though the opening title is boogey man 3 this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anywaypros: ha! thats a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung lets seeit has footage from the boogey man and umits mercifully short yeah thats about itcons: where to start decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are botched suzanna loves character was named lacey not natalie! and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978 also if this has a 3 in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genrefinal thoughts: the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves its one thing if that had been an original film that was the directors first and sucked but instead its supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror filmmy rating: 15
this movie is one among the very few indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the pt styled film songsthe cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entiretygone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when meena kumari refuses to say yes as an approval for nikah marriage bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy at the moment raj kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumarkamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinemas history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meenas close ups because meena kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971
most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this levelcheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman where johnson felt trapped by his blessings fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandleri see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that youre not alonejerry
soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70s and still very persuasive even by todays standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking this films quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive with over-population unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylents most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesnt really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70s cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and theres a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is science-fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! no fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet
michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men thats when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex thats when they lose any sense of innocence andor beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scopethe seeming primary reason for this movies existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as were treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrackthose with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain *how* to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist its a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen710
this happy-go-luck 1939 military swashbuckler based rather loosely on rudyard kiplings memorable poem as well as his novel soldiers three qualifies as first-rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the 1880s cary grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together set in faraway india this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din sam jaffe who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee sergeant archibald cutter cary grant of the last outpost sergeant macchesney oscar-winner victor mclaglen of the informer and sergeant ballantine douglas fairbanks jr of the dawn patrol are a competitive trio of hard-drinking hard-brawling and fun-loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins joan fontaine and enter the tea business naturally cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentines plans when their superiors order them back into action with sgt bertie higginbotham robert coote of the sheik steps out cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees lenser joseph h august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography
i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from steves animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script dont go if you must see it wait for the video
the script for this movie was probably found in a hair-ball recently coughed up by a really old dog mostly an amateur film with lame fx for you zeta-jones fanatics: she has the credibility of one mr binks
looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this 1985 version that looked interesting wow! it was amazing! very much a ken russell kind of film -quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire -it wasnt much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance; one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs: no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right
note to all mad scientists everywhere: if youre going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i dont care if hes a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha! get a load of this!!! paul the monster is ripping me to shreds!!!!! thats the worst part about this movie is this shark-thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there arent other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead: shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but thats a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie
what the is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you cant set your expectations for an 80s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for 089$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldnt possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didnt care they didnt try to create a tiny bit of tension the director stephen carpenter -- i guess its much easier to find money with a name like that also made the kindred 1986 wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga !!! who yeah thats right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits shes the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actorsthey dont deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting youre hoping they die a quick and painful deathand not only their charactersmy humble opinion = 0 10
intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip-off i do not make this observation lightly  i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over 1600 films 93% on them on dvd and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise - aimee & jaguar its in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty! to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right  we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow-up or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that its difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of sugarplams is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to queer culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at $995 this film would have been way overpriced; i understand that its soon to be re-priced under $20 which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of $2995 and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews  i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director writer actor in such a way that its obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it
would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didnt contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isnt any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they dont appear to live anywhere or have parents because p*rn films dont need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i havent ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old celebrated english film although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins richard burton sleepwalks through his role and sophia lorens closed in this movie face doesnt display much passion either **
simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst looking rather grown up danny huston and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups i liked the film its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies7 out of 10
faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer or something relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a petit-bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski no disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the films great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why arent other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film
eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes eva returning to her fathers home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched extase for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version my vote is eighttitle brazil: êxtase ecstasy
even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics its still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good jokefirst off jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor mans gerard depardieunaturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that the poor mans box office poisonreally that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the 4th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisiewhat am i saying it isnt lets just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasnt sharp enough satire is a tricky thingif it isnt sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke insteadi think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way eitherfor a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel filmvery sharp satire[potential spoiler alert]really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbés character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of controlthough im guessing he didnt cast jeroen krabbé because hes the worst actor and every character hes played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except hes incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well i just dont see it so you understand the dilemma im faced with here right it is the worst film ever because hes supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the 4th mans deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhovens reputation as a good director etc etc
if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captainafter ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire lifeacting---there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law againpaltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decisionstory---soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progressesdirecting---none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deali would have to give this movie a 0 out of 10 avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release
although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older womanim so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the charactersthe story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the storyi highly recommend this movie and i must confess ill forever look at my mom in a different light!
dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thorntons character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey - merk
i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branaghs performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carters star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep
ill dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery  its painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what theyre doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish theyd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to sufferthe films premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal! thats not a story its a passing thought at best - one that shouldve passed any self-respecting filmmaker by the leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck whats that you say he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isnt that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actors on-screen presence! my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by `explaining the action first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition show dont tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank!the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex-secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the filmthe films title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry dont be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office theres a very good reason for that!
at first sight this movie doesnt look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 65 must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surpriseyou would at first expect that this is a normal average typical 30s movie with a formulaic love-story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watchthe story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love-story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertainingthe movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesnt waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or funa delightful pleasant simple romantic-comedy that deserves to be seen by more!810
well then what is it! i found nicholsons character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica hustons character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut its not that i dont get it its not that i dont think that some of the ideas couldve lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that were supposed to accept these ideas and thats what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as afunny or beven remotely interesting!!! this was a waste of my time so dont let the hype get the best of youit is a waste of your time! with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful

i dont know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobici can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they dont get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway its not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do its full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funnyi hated it and im not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb werent as unbiased in their judgment
i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved; the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in 2007 when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didnt mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane
i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the uncovering of the murdererthe interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt columbo making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detectives real life fame as a crime-solver this is one of the best of many great columbo installments
this film is a massive yawn proving that americans havent got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them! the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate 810 it isnt just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce
i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer - sue smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didnt need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and in doing so embrace lifes possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped somersault i also think mandy62 was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good! i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods im glad i saw it
when i saw the previews for this movie i didnt expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and thats being generousfirst of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god-awful thing to endsecondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming pancakes!!! at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves ive never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come fromi just simply couldnt believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains outplease save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative
okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole 80s genre of these kind of movies because you dont see many like this one anymore! i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip-off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating ive never seen another movie like this one well not horror anywaybasically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranksso its like 10 years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters butthey are the only ones receiving them! so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off byyeah you probably know what happens!the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out betteri think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical!~*~cupidgrl~*~
stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in wild reeds and he is one of frances biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu newcomer jamie elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister with whom he has a competitive relationship soon the two are falling in lovethe films fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs bits and pieces of the present and real-time forward-movement into the future -- is a little daunting director sebastien lifshitz doesnt signal which time-period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out: the films final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart-breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must-see cinema
though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin sxsw film just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love and elizabeth this movie deserves an audience an inside look at the staging of the scottish play as actors call macbeth when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe with a wonderfully evocative score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not world-class but totally satisfying
yikes this is pretty bad the play isnt great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as peploe doesnt decide how she wants to treat the materials theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that youre watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvinos central performance is breath-takingly poor: stage-y and plummy its as if shes playing the part via helena bonham-carters merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but its hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaws ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana riggs daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertoluccis magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence
last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show youre not watchingwell theyre right that youre not watching it it aired twice and was ranked 147 and 145 out of 147translation: this is the lowest-rated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore its as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceledthe only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest-rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure
what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick: do not waste your time on this film
elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clintons bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now! is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series- the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequencethen you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven 90s hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadianfrench production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films co-producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
what a stunning episode for this fine series this is television excellence at its best the story takes place in 1968 and its beautifully filmed in black & white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images this is a story about two men who fall in love but i dont want to spoil this it is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in america written by the superb tom pettit and directed by the great jeannot szwarc we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob dylans gorgeous ah but i was so much older then im younger than that now as sung by the byrds this one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars beautiful
this movie was ok but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there arent enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through & not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable & that is the reason why i rated it so low its watchable but dont expect anything great
as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat 3 hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat 3 ive purchased thats been made recently i wasnt sure what to expecta cambodian hit-man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit-man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit-man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit-man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit-man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit-man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie its like a roller-coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit-man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking theres no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r1 release for sure great movie highly recommended
yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! thats because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isnt at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good its one of the better movies of this style i have seenthe unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenantsthe first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writers block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliotts block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alivethe second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdownchristopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very wellthe fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film its actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwees line when he basically said that lees and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosis! perhaps this is why lee didnt take this part! despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segmentconsidering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing its hard not to like this film
a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it upill admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experiencethe characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplaynot that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly motherking manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little differentokay - a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan
i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if youre expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash! the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle-aged man! the child is also lusted after by other leering men its sickeningpeter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple its revoltingi dont see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles
i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features skippy from family ties gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on vinyl! yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie skippy is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies
it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake theres nothing out there & the music they play in this is the funniest stuff ive ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both dont try very hard to sound sarcastic when theyre saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous! hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded! i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop!

warning: possible spoilers but not really - keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i wont have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no-one else did them; and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 & 2 plus teri hatcher from tvs supermanevery scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the shows perennial award-winning lead nicknamed americas sweetheart the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celestes show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because its always such a genuine thrill: adam did you watch i won!

i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didnt pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants
the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in 1930s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wangs family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying arttogether wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which cant help but to move and inspire
i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i dont want to spoil this film - dont worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but heres an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horseto be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid
i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isnt ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesnt make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit
how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the `worst film of all time by the `worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because its `so bad its goodan analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band-wagon syndrome--lets bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws wed citethe films universal poor quality goes without saying-- sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesnt allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this films poorness that thats a task not worth pursuingmy impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobsons sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grinchuckle moments all im sure none intentionalspiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad its good no it had just enough i cant believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing moredefinitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that wouldve significantly improved the experience for me so bad its mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey

as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates barely even reaching feature length can i do ittill i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you cant believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example: the santa claus gag; others are so long that you cant believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example: the students awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry dont get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny the iron phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4
i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow 2004 where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest rolelynn as im sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driverunfortunately other than lynns amazing performance im afraid this movie doesnt really have much going for itoh wait - there was one other thing - the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like: you son-of-a-gun! you son-of-a-witch! shoot! and well forget you!ok byeps: does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than its seen since the days of granny and jed clampett plot centers on two chauffers whove bet on which one of them can bed his employer both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy -- bisset and woronov first if manuel wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend! lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy teenaged niece on a year long missionary trip to africahilarious fun
some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a students graduate thesis in film schoolthere are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for hisher chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like youre at a picnic - but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw upall right im being a little rough on a young director who might still go places - as i said the camera work is quite goodbut i feel cheated - the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well - but nobody actually connected to the films making seems to know that this is the kind of film theyre supposed to be makingthat betrayal is what hurts; but even without it the fact remains that we dont like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just dont carei took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldnt give me my money backnow that really hurts
the original demille movie was made in 1938 with frederic march a very good film indeed hollywoods love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once
before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carreras sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesnt make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesnt do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concernedalthough its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies

those who are not familiar with cassandra petersons alter-ego elvira then this is a good place to startelvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of moneyunfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things: a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions:the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlockthe film is actually pretty funny with peterson aka elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and dont forget tomorrow were showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course
a sequel to actually a remake of disneys 1996 live-action remake of 101 dalmations cruella devil glenn close is released from prison after being cured of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr pavlov ugh! but the cure is broken when cruella hears the toll of big ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hidesthis movie is bad on so many levels starting with the fact that its a thanksgiving family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine glenn close over-over-over-over-acts as cruella with all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end -- i hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheckspeaking of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film of course the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs they serve as the macaulay culkins of this movie pulling all the stupid home alone gags on the villains biting them in the crotch running over their hands with luggage carts squirting them with icing etc etc etc ad nauseum i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humansgerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out french furrier the two human dog lovers -- rehashed from the earlier film but with different actors -- are completely boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home watching the dinner scene from lady and the tramp i thought to myself oh please dont go there! i half-expected the humans to do a satire on the lady and the tramp dinner scene -- as charlie sheen did in hot shots: part deux -- doing the spaghetti strand kiss pushing the meatball with his nose etcand dont get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idles voicethe costumes were nominated for an oscar and the costumes in the movie *are* good but they are the only good thing in the movie the rest of it is unbearable dreck
there are movies like plan 9 that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like waterworld that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love cowgirls have none of these redemptions the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what ive been told the book is enjoyablehow then could this movie be so intolerably bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law because the meat packing plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experiencethis movie now defines the basement for me it is so bad it isnt even good for being bad
and im serious! truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching whats so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is:1 a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge 2 brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies 3 breathtaking scenery and it doesnt matter if its real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view 4 a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film 5 louis sachar! the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldnt put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better 6 and speaking of the script! the one-liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more 7 beautiful soundtrack theres not a song in this film that i havent fallen for and thats something considering im supposed to be a punk-rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if youre going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the booki do not work for the people who made holes by the way im just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you havent seen it do it now this very instant go!
channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because its so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious; completely inane and the acting is throw-up-in-your-mouth badtheres low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel im sorry but watching 6 guys stare into every 10x10 boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didnt learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scenewow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! i dont buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells likeand it looks likewell you know the restavoid like the plagueedit: apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence ie its refreshing to seesure it may be refreshing to see but that doesnt equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly id rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again
when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant! however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film-making this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film historythe opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainmentsarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any directors dream at its very corehowever sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtakingthe dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning: spoilers!!! spoilers!!! where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert townein a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feattherefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easyall in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is morethe romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art
it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b-movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters its very un-funny even for a turkey
i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film! ive not laughed so much when watching a film for ages! and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! this film may not appeal to some people i cant really say why without spoiling it! but each to their own! i loved it and highly recommend it!the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it!although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch
this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen but i really cant recall when ive seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the conflict card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in*possible spoiler*the 40-or-so minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict
beautiful attracts excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on halmark producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish
complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too didnt most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries promptly impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free! first - this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d! what!!!! its not that hard to film in a car!!! second - the story isnt very good there are a lot of things wrong with itthird - why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film! it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed!!! watch it for a good laugh but dont waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around ! but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesnt fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own ! its a neurological drama ! it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a persons brainits the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deafno small feat for such a sort of a moviethe only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage !!!!!!
unfortunately for myself - i stumbled onto this show late in its lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline - but most of all the great actors! i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget moynahan was & the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez from carlitos way: rise to power and erika christensen swimfan i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime im viewing it on abcs website from the beginning
i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv its very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober depressing and not a little paranoid! despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! while not uninteresting in itself the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both dr strangelove [1964] and fail-safe [1964] and mercifully short the films single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents!
this was a hit in the south by southwest sxsw film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by ers gloria reuben and a scenery-chewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word macbeth is thought to bring on the plays ancient curse the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a well-known pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the green-eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes directors commentary and some deleted scenes as well
i gave 1 to this film i cant understand how ettore scolaone of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous! all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantialboring and not interesting too longtoo boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film
as a big fan of david mamets films and plays especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna i was expecting great things from this film instead i found myself annoyed by the films superficiality and lack of credibility racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized identity is totally reevaluated and men become heroes for no apparent reason because of his oaths taken as a cop the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal but then still refuses the minor action in addition a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting and the cops reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits needless to say after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet i was extremely disappointed to say the least 3 out of 10
i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb!!! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much
there is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the us version the person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got the us version of this show is everything that reality tv shouldnt be instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt i do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the us or if you beg hard enough you will receive the rather vulgar product placement that takes place particularly by sears is also uncalled for rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home build something for the whole community perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses
hello mary lou: prom night ii starts at the hamilton high school prom of 1957 where mary lou maloney lisa schrage is cheating on her date bill nordham steve atkinson with bud cooper robert lewis bill finds out & is devastated meanwhile mary lou is announced prom queen 1957 & takes to the stage to accept her award bill still hurting decides to play a practical joke on mary lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches mary lous dress setting it & her on fire within seconds mary lou is toast 30 years later & hamilton high is soon to hold its annual prom night bill micheal ironside is now the principal & has a teenage son named craig justin louis who is dating vicki carpenter wendy lyon & are both planning on going to the prom together bud richard monette is now a priest that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both bill & bud one day vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of mary lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death first up is jess browning beth gondek whose death is put down to a suicide mary lou begins to posses vickis body as the night of the prom draws nearer after disposing of some competition in the shape of kelly hennenlotter terri hawkes who tries to fix the prom so she wins mary lou in vickis body is crowned hamilton high prom queen which allows mary lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party upwith absolutely no connection to the original prom night 1980 & directed by bruce pittman i thought hello mary lou: prom night ii wasnt a particularly good film the script by ron oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations i suppose personally i found these different elements didnt really gel or work that well together at all the whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable after the opening sequence where mary lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil mary lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd killer not dead & ready for a sequel ending didnt you dont expect a hight body count just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although i did like the way monica beverley hendry as beverly hendry tried to hide in a shower room locker which mary lou crushed & resulting in poor monicas blood oozing out the supernatural side of hello mary lou: prom night ii is depicted by vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & mary lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag vicki into it the slasher side of hello mary lou: prom night ii isnt outstanding i did like mary lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one-liners & she made for a good villain even if she didnt get to kill enough people oh & yes i did get the running homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch i suppose the acting is ok but the normally dependable micheal ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if hes asking himself what hes doing in this & if hell ever work again forget about any gore someone is hanged there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen someone is impaled with a neon light a computer goes crazy & electrocutes someones face! & mary lou bursts out of vickis body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene there are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well if thats your thing to give it some credit hello mary lou: prom night ii is ok to watch has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made overall i was disappointed by hello mary lou: prom night ii it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes im not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating ill give it a 4 as theres nothing specifically wrong with it i suppose & ive sat through much worse films but it just didnt really do anything for me im afraid
a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this filmin fact what is the point of itthe scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storylinethe performances of the cast are questionable if not believabledid i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the sequel

terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations - gritty real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of sex in the city - in fact the entire film is an antidote to the hbohollywood notion of new york city sex and relationships its a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately loved it! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi rosario dawson and her love interest forgot his name!
my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out we have most lines memorized i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though im not her biggest fan this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fiancées house his conversation with the butler and susans father is side-spitting the line from the butler would you care to wait in the library followed by arthurs reply yes i would the bathroom is out of the question is my newmail notification on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff!
director fred schepisiroxanne directs this well intentioned but inferior comedy about albert einsteinmatthau trying to hook his scientific nieceryan up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950s to get ryan to like robbins einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scientist the idea is cute but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue tim robbins meg ryan and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat but are unable to rescue the film its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan
the question when one sees a movie this bad is not necessarily how did a movie this bad get made or even why did i see this awful in the first place but what have i learned from this experience heres what i learned:- just because the rules of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesnt mean someone wont go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them without a shred of humor or irony- if your movie has to be described as **loosely** based on the video game you have script problems- the black character may not always die first but the asian character does always know kung-fu- while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the the matrix effect on a budget that doesnt necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea- being ron howards brother does not guarantee choice roles- whenever a scene doesnt edit together just use some footage from the video game no one will notice- if your cousins rap-metal band offers to write your movies theme for free politely decline- zombie movies are not about people killing zombies theyre about zombies killing people preferably in the most gruesome way possible thats what makes them scary- white people who can pay $1600 to get to a rave deserve to die- if you find an old book it will tell you everything you need to know anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks what was that or where are we- bare breasts are not horror movie panacea- a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from student film to major studio release try it!- just because you can name-drop all three living dead movies that does not make you george romero or even paul w s andersonive seen worse movies but only because ive seen mortal kombat: annihilation
i used to watch this on either hbo or showtime or cinemax during the one summer in the mid 90s that my parents subscribed to those channels i came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark bizarre and fascinating i was young then in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great arliss howard and being blown away by big bad love i bought the dvd of wilder napalm and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years i absolutely loved it! i was really impressed and affected by it there are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads their story the music and all the other actors as well its truly cinematic i love arliss howards subtle intensity ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence im a big fan of anything he does; and his interplay with debra wingers manic glee they are of course married has that magic charming reality to it that goes past the camera i wonder if they watch this on wedding anniversariesbig bad love should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it; its brilliant and dennis quaid in full clown make-up sneakily introduced angled hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you dont see very often quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways with that huge slit mouth span hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness here as both both howard and quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion in fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity its really a fantastic film put together by intelligence imagination agility and chemistry by all parties involved i really cannot imagine how this got funded and it looks pretty expensive to me by such a conventional imagination-less system but i thank god films like this slip through the system every once in awhile in a great way with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors hip intelligence darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: grosse pointe blanknow thats a compliment in my book!
a truly dreadful film i did not know initially that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon i started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake american ones why did it need to be set n america anyway - it could have been set in nz and then the actors could have used their normal voices surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with american accents a bad bad film i am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can it just seemed like a very poor attempt at a segalwillis type action man flicka total waste of money! if there was any taxpayer money in this piece of trash i would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the treasury i am still reeling get it pun reeling! at the absolute garbage i have just seen why did i continue to watch well i am a movie fanatic and cant help myself!
maybe television will be as brutal one day maybe big brother` was only the first step in the direction stephen richard bachmann` king described the end point of but enough about that if i spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie i do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material its the same with the 6th day` no matter how primitive the film is it provokes a discussion about its topic which serves the producers as publicity lets not be taken in by that the social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative violent movie more for video sale than for cinema i didnt read the book i dont dare criticising stephen king without having read him but when i saw the film i thought they couldnt make such a terrible film out of a good book: in a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors arnold schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel tv show the audience is cheeringtogether with predator` this is definitely schwarzeneggers most stupid movie 2 stars out of 10
every country which has a working film industry has some sane and maybe some insane artist which make movies that you can only completely understand when youre a part of this country i guess hundstage is such a movieyou see the lowest level of austrias society dirty disturbed weird hateful but they still have enough money so they can afford tuned cars and big houses and they are definitely doing a lot of strange things here which maybe seems for them normal because theyre doing it through their whole life from a normal human viewpoint you can now easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of austrias art moviesbut if you live here and you know the people you see the characters in hundstage as the tumor of the society a society that is going more insane from day to day creating their own rules that nobody else can understand cave the social system from within and you see the people sitting in the park standing at the opposite street corner queuing in the same line maybe you meet em in a bar or a disco you may visit maybe you even work with them in your job or they are living next to your house you start to hate them without exactly knowing why youll try to get away - but you cannot maybe youll end up like them but it seems normal for you because youre doing it through your whole life nowlife isnt so bright though austria is one of the richest countries in the world it has beautiful people but some are also ugly there are a lot of hard working persons trying their best but there are also some riding on the back of others and destroying everything that the folk of austria has built up so fara very pessimistic movie
i was talked into watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on about what a cute story this wasyucki want my two hours back as i could have done so many more productive things with my timelike for instance twiddling my thumbs i see nothing redeeming about this film at all save for the eye-candy aspect of it310 and thats being generous

four stories written by robert bloch about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them the first has denholm elliott as a novelist who sees the killer hes writing about come to life some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife the third has christopher lee who has a child chloe franks and is scared of her it all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was much worse the last is an out and out comedy with jon petwee and ingrid pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires! theres also a cute line about christopher lee playing draculathis is a good horror anthology--nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire! also the house itself looks beautifuland very creepy its well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches a very good and unusual movie score too all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out try to see it on dvd--the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound

ive been looking for the name of this film for years i was 14 when i believe it was aired on tv in 1983 all i can remember was it was about a teenaged girl alone having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon i remember people were looking for herfamily and that she knew how to take care of herself---she narrates the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin i dont remember much else about this movie and want to see it again--if this is the same one--and if any of you have a copy could you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmailcom id be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember it was aired on thanksgivingus in 1983 and i was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me thanks in advance!
while i dont claim to be any sort of expert in marine life i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother! having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans! i mean really! this is basically the whole plot richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back
i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all second the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before the things isnt funny in the movie: fiancé hitting his girlfriend beatings the movie was way too long--talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing! some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on perry you can do better then this!
ive read some terrible things about this film so i was prepared for the worst confusing muddled horribly structured while there may be merit to some of these accusations this film was nowhere near as horrific as your average dvd programmer in fact it actually had aspirations it attempted something beyond the typical monsterslasher nonsense and by god there are some interesting things going onms barbeau is a miracle to behold she carries the film squarely on her shouldersthis is not to say that its a masterpiece unholy ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition there are just too many unexplained subplots trying to coexist and the plot loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example if hope knows that her mother is evil and that she will ultimately kill her brother then why doesnt she just kill ma in the films very first sequence seems like it would have beat the hell out of traveling into the future to do itstill i give unholy points for trying a little ambition is not a bad thing
yes i am just going to tell you about this one so dont read if you want surprises i got this one with the title christmas evil there was also another christmas horror on the dvd called silent night bloody night whereas silent night bloody night not to be confused with silent night deadly night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasnt quite as good it started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesnt deliver you need character development but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps about an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror and the guys he kills arent even his targets they are just making fun of him this is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty he then proceeds to try and kill this other guy and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace he promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out he then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom he cant seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat what the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place oh yeah the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play what was that even about he kept talking about something that was never really explained how does it end you ask well since i have spoilers i will tell you he runs off the road in his van and proceeds to well lets just say it was lame!!!!!!!!!!!!
i cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter bs amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn
this is where the term classic film comes from this is a wonderful story of a womans bravery courage and extreme loyalty poor olan got sold to her uncaring husband who through the years learned to appreciate her yeah right a pearl!! luise rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role and what a waste of an oscar in the great zigfield it really didnt show what if any talent she had other than her exotic beauty but in good earth she shows that she can really act! her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either people say that she didnt show any real emotions in this film like hell her character olan is a shy and timid woman with inner strength she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot if you people are saying that she doesnt act well in this film you are not looking!paul muni shows that he can act as well his character is not a likeable one to me he never sees her for what she is until the very end of the story a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother with her own special beauty the greatest one of all the beauty from within like a pearlif you get a chance to see this film watch it you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created
this is an awful film yea the girls are pretty but its not very good the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex didnt get in the way well okay it might be interesting but its not because its so badly paced and and only partly acted i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen probably more laughable then they do on tv i wont even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest never read about that in the old west this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forwardi like schlock films but this is ridiculous there is a reason that i dont go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good the plot taking a back seat to breasts the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level infantile but harmlessly fun something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudiethe ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex filmi need not watch this againof interest to probably no one the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrappedobviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives
zombie review #3**spoilers**few films are actually so bad theyre good and zombi 3 is not just bad its wretchedly unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them allmore than that its a film credited to lucio fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency sense or reason however we cant blame fulci as it wasnt really directed by him but by bruno mattei who doesnt even have fulcis sense of style to help carry the film mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitudeso im ashamed to say how much i enjoyed every worthless minute of zombi 3 it has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin characters weak story and lack of film making skill zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so its even funnier than nightmare citythe action starts when the death 1 gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in the escape who is the thief why did he steal it and why did the us military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea all these questions and more will fail to be answered in zombi 3after hiding out at a hotel the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it sending death 1 up into the atmosphere resulting in zombie birds! who then attack people and turn them into zombie people!!! if zombies are cannibals why dont the zombie birds just attack other birdsthen we meet our heroes a trio of horny gis and a coachload of girls theres a couple of other guys with them too but theyre not important - no one is important here youll be hard pressed to remember anyones face let alone their name or find a reason to care about them they end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief a week ago this place was buzzing with life now its buzzing with flies! but theres no escape from the undeadby this point youll either be completely sucked in or youll have turned the damned thing off the script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldnt save it so its just as well they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters the zombie acting here is an all time low theres no consistancy in how the zombies behave - some shamble about in the time honored style others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk a gimmick that gives the film its horrifying twist ending they die from gunshots to the chest rather than the head and even get knocked out by a good left-hook how can you punch out a zombie!!!!! in fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of vthe zombies also spend a lot of time hiding seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life they hide in bushes in garages in huts on roofs in the water and even underneath pregnant women at one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs to kill and eat her no! to push her into the water those zombies and their wacky sense of humour!there is plenty of gore though limbs are hacked wounds ooze green pus and theres much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in theres nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing but if bad make up effects are your bag you wont be let downall this and ive not even mentioned the awful music the inexplicable flying zombie head the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as really bad or the final chilling punchline in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie dj!! hes gone over to their side! our escaping heros cry before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never camezombi 3 is rubbish - it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of its existence erased yet somehow i feel my life is richer for having seen itdid i say richer i meant 88 minutes shorter
seven pounds: emotionally flat illogical morally disturbingthe movie was distributed in italy as seven souls i was curious about the original title and after some research i found out that it refers to shakespeares merchant of venice where the usurer shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant antonio who will have to give him a pound of his flesh in case he is not able to repay his debt whereas the italian translation makes bens plan something deeply human characterized by human sympathy the original one though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone makes it just in its reference to the flesh something cold rational deep-rooted in the physical side of man unfortunately i think that the real quality of bens plan is revealed by the original title: ita a cold machination aimed at donating parts of his body but lacking any authentic human empathy at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie the only exception is the love-story with the girl which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident to which ben yields but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement i really didnt like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide: besides being improbable it makes no sense i would have liked and i think it would have been more positive if in the end ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living thus helping those same people and maybe many more just standing near them and helping them through his presence he wouldnt have saved their lives miraculously of course: this would have probably caused more suffering but i think it could have been more constructive from a human and moral point of view there are many illogical and disturbing things: the initial reference to gods creation in seven days which by the way according to the bible are six!: what does it mean and what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad who can have normal sex with a man who feeling as it should be destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body doesnt seem to feel so much tried both emotionally and physically from his impaired condition the movie is saved by good acting but all the rest is pure nonsense not only from a logical point of view but also from a human and emotional one
this is one of those films that explore the culture clash of eastern born people in westernized cultures loving on tokyo time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences ken rock nroll fanatic marries kyoto a japanese girl so that she can stay in the united states when her visa expires the marriage is only expected to be temporary that is until kyoto gains legal status again but ken who seems to be lost in every relationship takes a liking to kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out this despite his friends urging that dumping kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of thatbut kyoto comes from a strict traditional japanese upbringing and doesnt expect to be married to ken all that long not only that she is homesick and wants to return to japan its sad in that this is finally someone ken thinks he can love and be with and all that except the one time he thinks hes found someone to feel that way about the girl isnt expecting to stay that long its not that she doesnt like ken its just that shes used to a whole nother way of life she says i cant tell him the way i feel in english and ken cant tell me the way he feels in japanese its a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtracki picked up loving on tokyo time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films tokyo pop and for those of you who enjoyed loving on tokyo time check out tokyo pop a new york singer goes to japan and joins a japanese american cover band except its a movie with a happy ending
i usually dont comment anything i read the others opinions but this this one i _have_ to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action f-117 and other hi-tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science fictionits one of the worst movies i have ever seensimply dont botherand one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site 37 points and i give this movie a try now im wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points
this night listener is better than people are generally saying it has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this the whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories one big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongno so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations no showdown scenes thank heaven you have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie williams isnt terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic no one as he is the everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story toni collettes performance should be nominated for an oscar even if she maybe shouldnt win it give it a shot for quality and content alone the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days
reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reesei have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in factanyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese
really the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by the bat people is some of the most effective ever there are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves that alone is enough to be unsettling: imagine all of them swarming after you and they do indeed swarm in what should have been a show-stopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs the problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film most of which consists of one or more people running around screaming waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacationthe fear is that he is coming down with rabies which does indeed suck so their vacation is ruined as the plot synopsis on the top of the bat peoples reference page does indeed point out so here is an effective summary of the movie: a young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat they bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving trying to convince those around him that its a bit more involved than rabies that he cant control himself and they everyone should keep awaynow when some one is frothing at the mouth covered with sweat eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper muppets and screaming at you to get away from me you get away from him you dont try to give him drugs you dont try to tell him you love him you give the guy his space go home and try that scenic getaway next yearbut no the people in this movie all behave like morons insist on pushing the guy to his brink and he flips out mutates into a part man part bat type creature and kills a bunch of non-essential secondary characters nothing wrong with that but the movie forgets that its a low budget creature feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study instead of a monster movie we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected pricethe main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes thirty tops and the movie should have been about the guy after he had turned into a bat person rather than about the journey there it takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining michael pataki as a small town cop whos lost his moral edge and the late paul carr as a physician friend who doesnt quite get the messagethe movie is dreadfully boring about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice forgettable little creature feature about a mutant run amok like the italian horror favorite ratman which i watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing me and my bright ideas though the scene with the cop car was a howler: too bad we couldnt have had another twenty minutes of that310
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boys father the majority of the film is the boys coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a good film worth watching several times annually
im surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe pasternak if this film is any indication they were almost polar oppositeswhile in three smart girls durbin plays an impulsive little miss fixit who after some setbacks manages to reunite her divorced parents in its semi-remake three daring daughters jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him too from the durbin and powell films ive seen id say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performersas for durbins performance in three smart girls i find it completely winning and most impressive although its clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna watching the self-confident knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes youd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 year-old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction given that this film and durbin herself were much publicized at the time as universals last chance the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age but youd never know it from the ease and assurance durbin displays on screen although shes clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like garland rooney oconnor and jane powell durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her and even here in her first film she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character and though shes occasionally shrill she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her successin short like all great singing stars durbin was much more than just a beautiful voice on the other hand while durbins pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument the most remarkable thing about it to me was the way she is able to project her songs without the slightest bit of affectation or grandnes that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like lily pons grace moore and jeanette macdonald in films of the periodthe film is also delightful heavily influenced by screwball comedy it backs durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pros such as charles winninger binnie barnes alice brady ray milland and mischa auer the story is light and entertaining true its hardly realistic but why would anyone expect it to be if you want :realistic rent the grapes of wrath or triumph of the will on the other hand if youre looking for a genuine sweet funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully charismatic and gifted adolescent lead and terrific supporting players this film wont let you down
i think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesnt live up to the trailer its a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think im seeing from the comments people having a lovehate relationship with this moviehowever if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think its still pretty good julia stiles is clearly the star shes so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with lee the rest of the cast of course lees testosterone-filled coworkers his elegant mother-in-law his fratlike friend jim and his bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make stiles stand out in the first place lee doesnt live up to his costars i dont think but you could view that as more that theyre hard to live up to maybe thats one source of disappointmentthe movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that dont come off as funny as the writers intended is still pretty funny and i found a rather intelligent film the themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers for example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choicethe other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which jason lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most partwhile it wasnt as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall its still a good movie
this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen it is not funny it is not interesting and should not have been made
everybodys got bills to pay and that includes christopher walkenin vietnam a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows including christopher walken following a mad max 3 ! thunderdome fight and a short massacre later walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or othercut to the present 1991 and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente hes successful at first but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank hes forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly which leads walken to assemble the old squad even though he wasnt actually part of that squad to begin with in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of peoplemcbain is a monumentally stupid film but for all that its also a good laugh and action packed too this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression or even breaking a window also it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police botheringtheres plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here from michael ironsides diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente and lets not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader being watched on television in america nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye that bitits out there for a quid buy it if you have a sense of humour see how many times you can spot the camera crew too
i grew up on scooby doo where are you and i still love it it is one of my favourite cartoons along with darkwing duck talespin peter pan and the pirates and tom and jerry this show though is good for kids the voices are gooddon messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation however it is rather disappointing i normally dont mind scrappy but when he appears to be like the main character it gets annoying fast complete with the catchphrase puppy power scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual also half the gang are missing after the first year somehow it didnt feel like scooby doo and the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies all in all not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo:get a clue but this show is disappointing 410 for the animation voices theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids bethany cox
lets cut to the chase: if youre a baby-boomer you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that in 1976 mccartney had the gumption to drop in on johns city hermit life and spend the day with him you also certainly wondered how things went i heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard from johns and pauls perspective and i admit that i reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does but none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does i found it amazingly lifelike perfectly plausible and 100 % saccharin-free now can anyone explain why i didnt hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the cbc last night i mean its already three years old for goodness sake! and yes if youre a beatles fan this is a must-see performance! even the subtle paraphrasing of beatles melodies in the background is inspired

one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen i wanted to vomit after watching it i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800s what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth branding oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasnt too bad but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom the story itself was ok the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800s but if you have a choice do not see this movie
the statistics in this movie were well researched there is no doubt about it! al gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got al gore is certainly quite an actor he sounds so concerned but actions speak louder than words! throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the moviejimmy carter unlike al gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well when carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the white house and got warm by wearing a sweateral gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet how much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create how much energy does it take to heat gores swimming pool behind his mansion it would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used but if we did the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a 50% loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50% so just turning it off would not be a very good ideathis movie is a veiled appeal to allow big goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is
you know you are in trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast it is a pity then that the parrot cat & dog were only in support & not the other way around as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughoutif i were you paul eva lake what sort of name is that jason & lindsay i would forget this acting lark & do something else as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry & awful actors to bootthe main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting me not gay which is funny as if you werent you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy tedious & dare i say very plain women leads in the filmthe worst film i have seen in years & hopefully never see one as bad again though i expect not
a tour deforce! ok the kid that plays oliver is a bit toooooo sweet! starting with the great cinematography color costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie i have seen several adaptations of this great novel but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot! it is a masterful fagan never leaving his character to do a song you never really know if you like him or not the same feeling i got in the book in other versions you hate him from start to finish bill sykes when you read the book hes a mean one and so he is in this movie oliver reed was masterful his wife directed this masterpiece i went and saw his last movie gladiator based on his many fine performances not to see the headliners the music fits the times and the mood who will buy this beautiful movie you should!
due to budget cuts ethel janowski again played by priscilla alden is released from a mental institution even though she killed six people and delivered to the hope bartholomew halfway house once there she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her foodholy moly! does this movie suck! you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film apparently filmed off a tv screen nick millard under his pseudonym nick phillips decided to return to the world of crazy fat ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend lets just say that millards unique style doesnt translate well to video seriously i have made home movies with more production value than this and millard tries to pull a silent night deadly night 2 by padding half the running time with footage from the first film which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy alden is again good as ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage i mean at least the first film tried here we have no music weaker effects if that is at all possible shaky camera work horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two vcrs hooked up avoid this at all costs!
sadly more downs than ups the plot was pretty decent i mean nothing out of the ordinary but it had a story unlike the other modern horror flicks the other good thing was the cast im not saying that the acting was good because it wasnt but every actoractress was hot and attractiveone of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so the rest was quite boring another down or you could consider it an up if you want is the excessive nudity all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time its not that im against nudity but this was a horror movie not the dreamersunless youre very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes or watch a girl get naked for no reason or youre a die-hard fan of debbie rochon than this is the movie for you but if youre looking for a good horror movie stay away
as a casual listener of the rolling stones i thought this might be interesting not so as this film is very of its age in the 1960s to me someone born in the 1980s this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but i am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th 60s i expected drugs galore with th stones i was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film i have not seen any of the directors other films but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing sort of amatuerish which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash badly directed tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this is that i didnt waste money on it it came free with a sunday paper
a real disappointment from the great visual master ridley scott gi jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character oneil played by demi moore there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldnt reach it properly it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the filmi really cant understand why ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert! it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique when i look at his latest film black hawk dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill the whole finale in gi jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killingthis is ridley scotts worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known still im glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scotts abilities but they are very few in this filma disappointment and nothing compared to the classics blade runner thelma & louise alien and so on of this talented director so im forced to give gi jane 410
a remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the women lawyers association wla of kumba in southwest cameroon in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence in this muslim culture where men have always been sovereign over women according to sharia law one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children after 17 years of failed efforts leaders of the wla began recently to score a few wins and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious storiesthe leaders of this legal reform movement are vera ngassa a state prosecutor and beatrice ntuba a senior judge court president both play themselves in this film which may contain footage shot spontaneously though i imagine much of it if not all consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera four cases are reviewed and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the filmtwo cases involve repeated wife beating with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child age 8 by an aunt one of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce we follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials the outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children the perpetrators receive stiff prison terms andor fines; the divorce is grantedthe aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties including those found guilty are treated this is a highly important and well made film of interest is the fact that one of the directors ms longinotto also co-directed the 1998 film divorce iranian style which dealt with related themes in tehran in broken english with english subtitles my grade: b+ 810
this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very medioacreunprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesnt matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the storyone of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i dont care what happens to them it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me
i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it 1010
i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in 1998 or 1999 one night when i was channel-surfing before going to bed and really liked what i saw since then ive been on the lookout scouring tv listings flipping through dvdvhs racks at stores but didnt find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it then being a world-class procrastinator i still didnt order it finally i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland or a few weeks ago then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching itso what do i think about the film its good not as good as i remembered and hoped for but still well worth the $999 it cost me after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 710 with potential to become an 810 ill have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue
one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and to be kind acting of less than oscar caliber but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft and especially a 747 some of the major blunders:1 no flight engineer or even a flight engineer station 2 mis-identifying the f-16 interceptors as f-15s no resmblance whatsoever 3 loading passengers into an aft baggage compartment supposedly accesible from the cabin - even if such a compartment existed placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable 4 hollow point bullets that wont damage the aircraft 5 the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke 6 an sr-71 of all planes with a pressure seal hatch 7 opening a cabin door outward - into the wind - in flight!!ah nuts it was just a truly lousy movie gotta make the list of bottom 10 of the year
things to come is that rarity of rarities a film about ideas many films present a vision of the future but few attempt to show us how that future came about the first part of the film when war comes to everytown is short but powerful ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking england--appeasement was at its height wells prediction was borne out all too soon the montage of endless war that follows while marred by sub-par model work is most effective the explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of german expressionist graphic design the art director was the great william cameron menzies and his sets of the ruins of everytown are among his best work margaretta scott is very seductive as the chiefs mistress the everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design the acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970 unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with 30s technology this is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing this is redeemed by raymond masseys magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well masseys final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight the scene is aided by the stirring music of sir arthur bliss whose last name i proudly shareunfortunately the vhs versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038 i hope a good dvd exists of the entire film
i just saw this episode this evening on a recently-added presentation by one of our local independent channels which now presents two episodes each weekdayas the gentleman opined in the other previous comment here i agree this may not have been one of the best programs of the series but i find it entertaining nonethelessmy father was a friend of one of the principals in my hometown cincinnati for whom young rod serling had worked in the media there -- and i remember dad telling how talented and creative he was remembered there overall twilight zone is certainly one of the true classics in television and given its production during the height of the cold war period provides not only a view of this era in the country but also today a nostalgic picture of production techniques creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago* minor spoiler*this particular story depicts as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere a story where the locale is meant to provide a surprise ending sometimes the characters are on earth from elsewhere while the story at first implies at least one is an earthling these usually contained the message as here of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this cold war periodviewed today stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4-5 decades ago and still provide some food-for-thought -- as did this episodewhile the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads it still presents a simple important message and a worthwhile 20-some minutes of entertainment and interest
i dont usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to startthe acting on jeremy londons part was horrible! i didnt think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start well at least i got good laughs i wouldnt waste my time if i were you
this is not bela lagosis best movie but its got a good old style approach for some 40s horror entertainmentbrides are dropping dead at the altar like flies i think id postpone the wedding until after the fiend is caught but its a horror movie so i guess people ignore the danger for some reason anyway lagosi is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to keep his aging sickly wife healthy and happy he always eludes the keystone cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse who would think of looking for a corpse in a hearse and the brides just keep on getting zappedno movie like this would be complete without a lois lane type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own good at solving crime bad at keeping her mouth shut at all the wrong times guess who lagosi picks for his next intended victim i love the haunted house bit where lois lane gets stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at lagosis sinister mansion hidden passageways a vampire-like wife an evil dwarf igor assistant and so on good stufffairly well done pacing keeps the film moving and the story resolves itself in a typical but satisfying manner if you like old horror movies this one is worth a watch
aim for the top! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it i totally loved this series and to this day it remains my favorite anime and while it was not gainaxs first animated product it was their first ova seriesmainly starting out as a parody of the 1970s sports drama aim for the ace ace o nerae! gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father who was killed in mankinds initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with it is because of her fathers death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters her friend kazumi amano even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot however norikos coach koichiro ota has faith in her and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot for he was a survivor of the battle in which norikos father was killedother characters include jung-freud a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to smith toren a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together and kimiko higuchi norikos childhood friend kimikos involvement is also of interest as while noriko is off in space kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life and because of the acts of time dilation kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school by the end of the series noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid-fiftiesall in all this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation if you like hideaki annos other shows or are a fan of haruhiko mikimotos artwork then give this show a chance it will grow on you
the british public school system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconceptionit was designed to produce administrators and governorscivil servants and military men to run the british coloniesthese people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classeswhen the public schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the casethey tended to favour the schools nearer town so eton and harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent the vast majority of public schools took their pupils from lower down the social scaletom brownperhaps the most famous public school pupil everwas the son of a country parsonnot a belted earl thus in late 1960s englanda country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as harold wilson could slip off his gannex maclindsay andersons if was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else it must be remembered that the so-called summer of love was followed by the october revolution a non-event that left a few policemen in london with bruised heads and the us embassy with one or two broken windowsbut achieved absolutely nothing so when mr andersons film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as mr malcolm mcdowells glorious victory over an amorphous them despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the enda fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the usembassy the film told us nothing new about public schoolshomosexualitybullying cold showerspatrician sarcastic teacherssilly traditionsan all-too familiar list it was declared to be an allegory comparing britain to the corruptcrumbling society represented by the schoolwellnearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishingthe british social system has not changedthe october revolution has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and mr anderson has completed his state of the country trilogy to no effect whatsoever if by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than mr mcdowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the talefind a copy of stalky & cowritten by the man whose much-maligned poem if lent its name to mr andersons filma man born in colonial indiaa man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary historyand do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non-personperhaps somebody should start a revolution about that

i watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured foreverhowever i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one i had never seen before graham greene has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as thin man and in lesser vehicles confidential agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of bacall and boyers depictions as respectively british and spanish and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads in some ways this last problem actually begins to work in the films favor for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one persons tragedy the most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from greenes complex and guilt-ridden psychology which pervades the film i know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull and i can understand that yet i found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world i was compelled to watch not by any great acting although boyer is marvelous as usual managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness tragedy hope and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes but by the down-spiraling rush of one mans slim hopes against a world of oppression and money what is a thief what good is love in the face of death where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin the film does not rise to the level of art and thus cannot hope to answer such questions but it is much more than mere entertainment and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn the lack of glitz of bubble of narrative bounce help to make this movie very worthwhileand there is no happy ending for history wrote the ending
when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old amitabh bachchan romances a 34-yr old tabu wait! in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of cheeni it is the content that is kum in this adman turned writer-director r balkis maiden efforttrust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating by the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished there is not much left to be said therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girls father to the extent that he goes for a satyagrah is really a test of patience there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in the result second half is dry flat with no energy there is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer not making much impact nonetheless the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances
danireese witherspoon has always been very close with her older sister maureenemily warfield until they both start falling in love with their neighbor courtjason london but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade awaythis was truly a heartbreaking story about first love probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie i would give the man in the moon 8510
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike its even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla its an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really cant treat them just like people because they arent not many films venture into this territory and its worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity
ive read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so lets focus on the movie and the messagei have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for a family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10i like poprock music im 45 i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didnt recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any self promotioni watch movies to be entertained i dont care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain mei watched this movie for the message the worlds greatest epidemic is low self-esteem which is a whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give updont give up message so yeh it was a bit predictable great message thoughshould be more of themthis movie is a great family movie but for a bloke watching by himself get hannibal
like other people who commented on fräulein doktor i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv without having heard of it before the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the beginningto me this is one of the five best movies about wwi the others are all quiet on the western front paths of glory gallipoli and the post-war la vie et rien dautre and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling; the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masksi only wish i had taped the film
title: zombie 3 1988 directors: mostly lucio fulci but also claudio fragasso and bruno mattei cast: ottaviano dellacqua massimo vani beatrice ring deran serafin review: to review this flick and get some good background of it i gotta start by the beginning and the beginning of this is really george romeros dawn of the dead when dawn came out in 79 lucio fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it zombie 2 that film is the one we know as plain ole zombie you know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! ok so after that flick named zombie 2 in italy came out and made a huge chunk of cash the italians decided heck lets make some more zombie flicks! these things are raking in the dough! so zombie 3 was born confused yet the story on this one is really just a rehash of stories weve seen in a lot of american zombie flicks that we have seen before this one the best comparison that comes to mind is return of the living dead lets seetheres the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies canister gets released into the general population and shebang! we get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh a bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel they gotta fight the zombies to survivethere was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie first and foremost lucio fulci the beloved godfather of gore from italy was sick so he couldnt really finish this film the way that he wanted to the film was then handed down to two lesser directors bruno mattei hell of the living dead and claudio fragasso zombie 4 they did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good you see fulci himself didnt really have his heart and soul on this flick he was disenchanted with it he gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: do whatever the hell you want with it! and god love them they didand that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great fulci credited as its director the main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! theres no substance to it whatsoever! after the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies now in some cases this can prove to be fun if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 theres a lot of gore and guts involvedhere we get neither! well theres some inspired moments in there like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people that was cool theres also a scene involving a flying zombie head wich by the way defies all logic and explanation and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs but aside from thatthe rest of the flick just falls flat on its assendless upon endless scenes that dont do jack to move the already non existent plot along that was my main gripe with this flick the sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent i hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! i like my b-movies but this one just really went even below that! its closer to a z-level flick if you ask methe zombie make up pure crap the zombies are all asian actors the movie was filmed in the philippines so you get a bunch of asian looking zombies but thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway its the look of the zombies that really sucks! they all died with the same clothes on for some reason and what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up more like smudges on their faces one or two zombies had slightly more complex make up but it still wasnt good enough to impress its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces so not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap these are supposed to be dead folks! anyhows for those expecting the usual coolness in a fulci flick dont come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody elses flick and those two involved mattei and fragasso didnt really put there heart and souls into it in fact when you see the extras on the dvd you will see that when fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick he doesnt even take it to seriously you can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they just had a job to do and they did it and that my friends is the last nail on this flick theres no love and no heart put into making this film therefore you get a half assed crappy zombie flickonly for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made everybody else dont even bother! rating: 1 out of 5
this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film stridesit is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you arent familiar with hong kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior its a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film
this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the action-horror-romantic-comedygenre some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the worlds best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended
a lot of promise and nothing more an all-star cast certainly by hk standards but man oh man is this one a stinker no story thats okay the action will make up for it like most hk action flicks what the action is terrible corny and sparse dragon dynastys releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in asian cinema this is a blight they managed to wrangle a couple of actors from infernal affairs but they cant bring life to a disjointed script there are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying you almost feel like theyre each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters michael biehn is made of wood really sammo hung uses a stunt double no way yes way stay away
i rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes kickboxer look like die hard lou and reb are in vietnam and as lou saves reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever the vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard i swear! lou is now brain damaged and reb and him live together and own a bar super homoerotic lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and reb goes on a killing spree to get him back there is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person characters personalities change in matter of seconds one guy is a bad and in the next scene hes good the acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental frank stallone sounding song that would make you sick i hated this film
this movie is not based on the bible it completely leaves christ out of the movie they do not show the rapture or the second coming of christ let alone talk about it it does not quote from scriptures the end times are called the great tribulation the movie does not even show bad times the seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing its structure the anti-christ was killed 3 12 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended the only part they got correct was there was two prophets the did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures the worst part of it was i really wanted it to be a good movie i wanted to take unsaved people to it i feel that the movie is evil it is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does i just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind booksthe second problem with the movie is it was just bad bad acting bad special effects bad plot and poor character development i have seen better episodes of miami vice

this one came out during the western genre’s last gasp; unfortunately it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field! to begin with the plot offers nothing remotely new: james coburn escapes from a chain gang intent on killing the man now retired who put him there – charlton heston while the latter lays a trap for him coburn outwits heston by kidnapping his daughter barbara hershey naturally the former lawman – accompanied by hershey’s greenhorn fiancé chris mitchum – sets out in pursuit of coburn and his followers all of whom broke jail along with himrather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-fordian style mclaglen goes for a sam peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease: repellent characters plenty of violence and the sexual tension generated by hershey’s presence among coburn’s lusty bunch incidentally heston and coburn had previously appeared together in a sam peckinpah western – the troubled major dundee 1965; i really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on dvd though i recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off tcm uk anyway the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for suggested also by the title: then again both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most american of genres – will penny 1968 for heston and coburn with pat garrett & billy the kid 1973! at least though heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed coburn by anticipating what his next move will be; the latter however tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of hershey apart from the latter this lengthy sequence sees heston try to fool coburn with a trick borrowed from his own el cid 1961 the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists as was his fashion heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice!the supporting cast includes michael parks as the ineffectual town sheriff jorge rivero as coburn’s mexican lieutenant and larry wilcox – of the tv series chips! – as the youngest member of coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over hershey while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away! jerry goldsmith contributes a flavorful but at the same time unremarkable score
i dont know about you but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york and as far as i am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat!as magical as jerrys exploration of the big apple might be for the other t&j fans who have commented here on imdb i couldnt wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvdin fact the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost buys the farm hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road
i cannot say that aag is the worst bollywood film ever made because i havent seen every bollywood film but my imagination tells me that it could well bethis film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director and i for one be believe he has been successful in his mission no a-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with itbut lets not just blame the director here there is the cinematographer who looks like hes rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award there is the over dramatic score that hopes to carry you to the next scene the lighting man who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene and of course the actors! some of them are by no means newcomers else all could be forgiven here the ensemble of actors in aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of indias most loved movie of all time sholay one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film they are a-list and willing participants to something that lets face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation so it begs the question amitabh aside for now did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original did amitabh bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film dont be stupid of course he didnt this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walki truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film which only succeeds in polluting everyones mind when they watch the original
what is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film no point this is why the prom night sequels are so embarrassingly badthe original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed bar one in a brutal act of revenge can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen-to-be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then prom night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen but in the end i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad you end up laughing yourself through it
this drummond entry is lacking in continuity most of them have their elements of silliness the postponed wedding and so on however this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another the house seems more like a city theres also leo g carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no-one seems to even look at he is a stranger and acts rather suspicious but drummond and the folks dont seem to pick up on anything still it as reasonably good action and a pretty good endingi know that algie is supposed to be a comic figure but like nigel bruce in the rathbone sherlock holmes flicks he is so buffoonish that its hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him is there a history behind him that will explain how he and drummond became associates
hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a religious picture strange cargo proves to be no exception although utilizing the talents of a superb cast and produced on a top budget with suitably moody photography by robert planck the movie fails dismally on the credibility score perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewers involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters i found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors parallels and biblical references and impossible to accept bathed-in-light ian hunters smug know-it-all as a christ figure and the censors in boston detroit and providence at least agreed with me the movie was banned few bostondetroitprovidence moviegoers if any complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that gable and crawford had somehow become involved in a message picture it flopped everywhereoddly enough the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on tv a home atmosphere appears to make the movies allegory more receptive to viewers however despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film the plot of this strange cargo flows along predictable heavily moralistic lines that will have no-one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny
being a music student myself i thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch little did i know i had no idea this movie was based on a book by britney spears this movie was implausible throughout its obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesnt know a thing about classical music let me give you just a few examples: 1 there is no way anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! just having a nice pop voice isnt enough besides thats a different thing altogether - another genre different technique its like playing the violin when applying for a viola class 2 how come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury if she wasnt a singing professor herself she would have no say in a situation like that and if she was a singing professor why werent we told so 3 being able to read music is a necessity if youre to major in music 4 how did angela get a hold of that video tape that would have been kept confidential for the jurys eyes only now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didnt have a clue i wonder which 5 the singing professor gave holly the carmen song saying she had the range which she clearly did not yes she was able to sing the notes but carmen is a mezzo-soprano while hollys voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre not at all compatible with that song 6 worst of all: not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music but it doesnt even try to hide it the aria that angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - mozart would roll over in his grave the habanera from carmen sounded a bit weird at times too and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - its stiff and boring but hey add some drums and electric guitars and its almost as good as britney spears! i know these are all minor details but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research anyhow i might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated but without that i really cant find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one: its good for a laugh
im not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and theres almost no plot anyway ive seen several reviewers call isoyg an anti-rape film or even a feminist statement and i just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claimsfirst of all what do we see on the cover of this movie thats right: a shapely womans behind whether it was zarchis attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and i absolutely dont believe it was - is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual penetration is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy itthe rapes in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch theres something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed mere moments before hes murdered so the scene isnt at all engaging on an emotional level really its just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies isoyg is associated with on imdb caligula cannibal ferox etc that it attracts only the exploitation crowdfinally a few reviewers have commended zarchis so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thingim not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of isoyg im all for exploitation horror and love video nasties in fact im giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films however its also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to rollthis is probably worth watching once if youre a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but im telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation
this was the first ppv in a new era for the wwe as hulk hogan the ultimate warrior ric flair and sherri martel had all left a new crop of talent needed to be pushed and this all started with lex luger a former nwa world heavyweight champion being given a title shot against yokozuna lex travelled all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the japanese monster who was actually samoan and get the wwe championship back into american hands as such there was much anticipation for this matchbut every good ppv needs an undercard and this had some good stuffthe night started off with razor ramon defeating ted dibiase in a good match the story going into this was that dibiase had picked on ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 kid on raw in july ramon angry had then teamed with the 1-2-3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted dibiase and irwin r shyster to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches dibiase vs ramon and shyster vs the kid razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a razors edgenext up came the steiner brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies depsite the interference of the bodies manager jim cornette who hit scott steiner in the throat with a tennis racket they were able to pull out the win in a decent matchshawn michaels and mr perfect had been feuding since wrestlemania ix when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex luger perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard diesel micheals and perfect had an excellent match here but it was diesel who proved the difference maker pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count outirwin r shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night easily accounting for the 1-2-3 kidnext came one of the big matches of the night as bret hart prepared to battle jerry lawler for the title of undisputed king of the wwe but lawler came out with crutches saying hed been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that hed arranged another opponent for hart: doink the clown hart and doink had a passable match which hart won with a sharpshooter he was then jumped from behind by lawler this bought wwe president jack tunney to the ring who told lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didnt wrestle hart hart then destroyed lawler winning with the sharpshooter but hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision so after all that lawler was named the undisputed king of the wwe this match was followed by ludvig borda destroying marty janetty in a short matchthe undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey wippleman which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated wipplemans client kamala at summerslam and continued when wipplemans latest monster the giant gonzales had destroyed taker at the rumble and then again at wrestlemania with a decisive victory over gonzales here gonzales then turned on wippleman chokeslamming him after a poor matchnext it was time for six man tag action as the smoking gunns bart and billy and tatanka defeated the headshrinkers samu and fatu and bam bam bigelow with tatanka pinning samuthis brings us to the main event with yokozuna flanked by jim cornette and mr fuji putting the wwe title on the line against lex luger and it was all on board the lex express lex came out attacking but yokozuna took control lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring luger then attacked cornette and fuji as yokozuna was counted out luger had won a fine match!!!!! balloons fell from the ceiling the heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win yokozuna may have retained the title but luger had proved he could be beaten the only question was who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him
i really dont get all the adulation that this film has received its mawkish unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie nashs affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places that i suppose in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable but whats with all the praise for russell crowes performance the man just seems to shuffle about clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that crowes performance is little short of caricature it is also rather offensive and dare i say just on the right side of being truly terrible
de vierde man the fourth man 1984 is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like total recall basic instinct and starship troopers is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author jeroen krabbe going to the seaside for recovering there he meets a mysterious femme fatale renee soultendieck and starts a fatal love affair with her he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstancesde vierde man is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argentothe cast is also outstanding especially krabbes performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career the living daylights the fugitive if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv video or dvd dont miss it!
this is a great movie i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink and the skeletons chase him but luckily he dodged them opened the window and didnt even notice them xiao qian is very pretty too & when he stuck the needle up ma wus butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic xiao qian and ning look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the 90s
i should never have started this film and stopped watching after 34s i missed the really botched ending this film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better it had nice atmosphere a top notch cast and director good locations but a baaaaaad story line a bad script i paid attention to kenneth branaghs southern accent--it was better than the script the plot was stupid--driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways no one behaves like this outside of hollywood scripts
i didnt even know this was originally a made-for-tv movie when i saw it but i guessed it through the running time it has the same washed-out colors bland characters and horrible synthesized music that i remember from the 80s plus a social platform that practically screams afterschool special anyhoorona jaffes thank you mazes and monsters was made in the heyday of dungeons & dragons a pen-and-paper rpg that took the hearts of millions of geeks around america i count myself one of said geeks tho i have never played d&d specifically i have dabbled in one of its brethren m&m was also made in the heyday of d&ds major controversy-that it was so engrossing that people could lose touch with reality be worshiping satan without knowing blah blah i suppose it was a legitimate concern at one point if extremely rare-but it dates this movie horrendouslywe meet 4 young college students who play the aptly named mazes and monsters to socialize and have a little time away from mundane life except that m&m as presented is more boring than their mundane lives none of the allure of gaming is presented here-and jay jays request to take m&m into the real world comes out of nowhere its just an excuse to make one of the characters go crazy out of nowhere also-though at that point we dont really care jay jay robbie kate and daniel are supposed to be different-but theyre all rich waspy prigs who have problems no one really hasbut things just continue getting worse in more ways than one the low budget comes dreadfully clear i love the entrance sign and cardboard cutout to the forbidden caverns robbiepardu shows why hes not a warrior in the oafiest stabbing scene ever and the payoff atop the two towers is unintentionally hilarious tom hanks blubbering jay jay what am i doing here made me laugh for minutes on end definitely the low point in his careerdont look at it as a cogent satire just a laughable piece of 80s tv trash and youll still have a good time that is if you can stay awake the majority is mostly boring but its all worthwhile for pardus breakdown at the end at least tom hanks has gotten better not that he could go much worse from here
i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldnt buy a copy for my friend!its a touching story about how people with eating disorders dont necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else! no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i havent seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you dont use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy weller is german210 because the photography could be worse
when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar an arab potentate visiting washington dc his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agendaa map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen in an area of barren desert known as the rub al-khali or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department; they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem sunnys new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet hera plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the films satirical content is rather toned down possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their countrys foreign policy; this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters if the film had been made a couple of years later in the wake of the irancontra affair its tone might have been differentthe film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm sunny is a typical goldie character- pretty sweet-natured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde actually that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from oregon on the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girlthe more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than hisher material and protocol is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley nastassia kinski film harem about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizens duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedygoldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as cactus flower overboard and housesitter but protocol is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst 310
monstervision was a show i grew up with from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one the only joe bob briggs the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-inwithout a doubt the best late night television ever if you didnt stay up you were missing outi know john bloom and joe bob live on but i want them back where they belongmonstervision! questiondid anyone else sit through all 4 hours of the swarm q:long live monstervision!
i have seen virtually all of cynthia rothrocks films and to me this is the funniest it reminds me of early jackie chan movies admittedly ms rothrock may not be the greatest actress but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady this film while probably not the best of all her films was the most entertaining
a patient escapes from a mental hospital killing one of his keepers and then a university professor after he makes his way to the local college next semester the late profs replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings the dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the 80s despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible!! splatter university is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape that would be more entertaining skip it and rent girls nite out insteadrated r for strong graphic violence profanity brief nudity and sexual situations
i have seen about a thousand horror films my favorite type this film is among the worst for me an idea drives a movie so even a poorly acted cheaply made movie can be good something weird is definitely cheaply made however it has little to say i still dont understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film something weird has little to offer save yourself the pain!
this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 911 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political some are not; some are solely about 911 some simply use 911 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerfulthis is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really tick off the right wingers one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from uk which recounts the us-backed overthrow of chile on sept 11 1973 which resulted in 50000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe iteven though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this its very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place some weak some very powerful; im giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get censored mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment
this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who wouldve thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very creative!add johnny wang in the mix and youve got an awesome final showdown! dont mess with manchu thugs; theyre ruthless!
have not watched kids films for some years so i missed here come the tigers when it first came out never even saw bad news bears even though in the 70s i worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie warriors man who would be king and rocky horror picture show among others now i like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on just minutes into this movie i could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for hisher appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting werent doing the job lo and behold i spied wes cravens name in the credits as an electrical gaffer hed already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created freddie krueger or made the scream movies maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic more surprising was fred j lincoln in the cast credits as aesop a wacky character in the movie fj lincoln from the 70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films he was associated with the adult spoof the ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of tigers attempts at humor combined let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel
you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  herbie: fully loaded with crap and yes it is true this movie is really dreadful and totally lamethis got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie i dont see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie isnt he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it what i didnt like about this movie is also base on how herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a beatle i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictablefinal words: unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie what wastage of my money i feel like cheatedrating: 310 grade: f
i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television it is far superior in action than most movies since martin sheen is excellent and though nick nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support vic morrow as the villain is superbwhen sheen tests the water in his 34 ford cool along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!the ending is grandim disappointed in the low vote this received i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these daysgood taste eludes the masses!
it takes patience to get through david lynchs eccentric but-- for a change-- life-affirming chronicle of alvin straights journey but stick with it though it moves as slow as straights john deere when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging the painful regrets and secrets and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation richard farnsworth caps his career with the years most genuine performance sad and poetic flinty and caring and sissy spacek matches him as his slow daughter rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family
hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler jon voigt and his lame con-man sidekick dustin hoffman soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skillsa daring film for its time and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the 60s symbolic of the end of innocence in american films since it was the only x-rated film to win a best picture oscarjon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk befriended by a lame con-man dustin hoffman he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida a land his friend ratzo dreams of living inbut even in this final quest the two are losers john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt and john barrys haunting midnight cowboy theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperationsumming up: a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life
this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you ive read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child beaters and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie the realism of the movie and its performance by bret carr is not to be missed the very nature of its almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity bravo on the next level of cinema
oh sam mraovich we know you tried so hard this is your magnum opus a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the academy of motion picture arts and sciences as you state on your 1998-era web site alas its better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt with ben & arthur you do just thatseemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education the films screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene its this insane excuse of a story that may also be the films best ally beginning tepidly the homosexually titular characters ben and arthur attempt to marry going so far as to fly across country to do so in the shade of vermonts finest palm trees but all of this posturing is merely a lead-in for blood then more blood and more and more blood i mean there must be at least $20 in fake blood make-up in the final third of this filmthe film in its entirety is a technical gaffe from the sound to the editing to the music which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard its a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on its such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted hereno matter sam im sure youve made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls such as myself to view this film sadly were not laughing with you
i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movies release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute; homosexuality; loneliness; physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970s midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r some of the scenes could almost be rated pg-13 by todays standardsi want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con-man named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again joe is conned and before long is homeless however joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams ie joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his healthi want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all the acting is excellent especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes in fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny i find them amusing for example there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey im walkin here! im walkin here! i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso dustin hoffman sends joe jon voight to a guy named odaniel what is amusing is that at first we think odaniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that odaniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self-defense john wayne! you gonna tell me hes a fag! what i like is the delivery in that scenei would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late 60s much of it rings true today thats because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voights character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that ratso dustin hoffmans character was a good influence on himin conclusion i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck jon voights character and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending while i dont want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open-ended
shannon leethe daughter of bruce leedelivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating hong kong movie and proves that like her late brother brandon she is a real chip off the old block there is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of and nowyoure dead when you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was createdi genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut bruce lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring shannon does not let the family name down herealthough there are several pleasing performances in this movie michel wong for oneit is shannon lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as mandy the hitgirl supremehell;you may well come away whistling her fights!

reda is a young frenchman of moroccan descent despite his muslim heritage he is very french in attitudes and values out of the blue his father announces that reda will be driving him to the hajj pilgrimage to mecca--something that reda has no interest in doing but agrees only out of obligation as a result from the start reda is angry but being a traditional muslim man his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his misgivings both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible--and its very ironic when the dad tells his son that he should not be so stubbornwhen i read the summary it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other however i really dont think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film sure there were times of understanding but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression i actually liked this and appreciated that there wasnt complete resolution of this--as it would have seemed phonyoverall the film is well acted and fascinating--giving westerners an unusual insight into islam and the hajj it also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional islam and the secular younger generation while the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some i think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people--not some formula a nice and unusual film
really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makersif youre going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talkingthere seems to be no editing effects- fades wipes etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenesterrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end creditsthe werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didnt even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks arms or wristsi guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movieno reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video
i dont know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling laughter cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that eitheryou are just watching images for +- 2 hrs there are more useful things to doi guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 eur of your money for me the answer is: no
this was an awful movie! not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this! plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! again the previews say nothing about this! not that you would expect that but its just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i wouldve never have seen it or at least i wouldve been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again!
i am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between on golden pond and the prince of tides this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off the main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between garry marshalls sentimental direction and mark andrus dark rather confusing screenplay the story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother lilly and daughter rachel who have driven all the way from san francisco to small-town hull idaho where grandmother georgia lives the idea is for lilly to leave rachel for the summer under georgias taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellionthe set-up is clear enough but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline it veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution the three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smokers voice lindsay lohan makes rachels promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior felicity huffman is forced to play lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughters state of mind she does what she can with the role on both fronts but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human beingat close to seventy jane fonda looks great even as weather-beaten as she is here and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty georgia the problem i have with fondas casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares between this and 2005s execrable monster-in-law it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her it should come as no surprise that the actresses male counterparts are completely overshadowed garrett hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve harlan a devout mormon whose sudden love for rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint cary elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as lillys husband an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movies endingthere is also the omnipresent dermot mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower lillys former flame and rachels new boss as town veterinarian dr simon ward laurie metcalf has a barely-there role as simons sister paula while marshall regular hector elizondo and songsmith paul williams show up in cameos some of andrus dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right there are several small extras with the 2007 dvd none all too exciting marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor there are several deleted scenes including three variations on the ending and a gag reel a seven-minute making-of featurette is included as well as the original theatrical trailer a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to marshall
this movie is truly brilliant it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you dont even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past but it doesnt stop there! this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy: behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the over-abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like theres no tomorrow and the way he swung it i really am amazed there *was* a tomorrow for him or at least for his beer gut dont miss this movie its a fantastic romp through idiocy and sheer bloody mindedness! and once you have finished watching this one dry the tears of joy or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $5 to make a sequel!
yep lots of shouting screaming cheering arguing celebrating fist clinching high fiving & fighting you have a general idea as to why but can never be 100% certain a naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points but then youd probably spot the many flaws not an awful film & hackman & washington are their usual brilliant but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on im still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other & dont argue but then you probably wouldnt have a film410
this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street especially the character eloise whos a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles youll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheauxs films swing is the best! the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shameadding further info popular blues singer of the 20s and 30s cora green is the focus of the film shes mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hot-cha entertainer in the 30s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess shes playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but thats not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between theres great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing theres even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them theres even a scene where theres blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold movethis movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show businessno these early race films may not be the best cant be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black persons eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films werent the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldnt afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some werent great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most werent good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actorsactresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didnt want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think youll be able to spot the true actorsactresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films arent the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didnt start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films arent the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem keep punching sunday sinners dark manhattan broken strings boy! what a girl mystery in swing miracle in harlem and sepia cinderella that not only has good entertainment but good acting
i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london sci-fi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it i found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blindtheres nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level
this is the best emma in existence in my opinion having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austens masterpiece the 1996 movie with g paltrow is good too its just that its almost like a different story altogether its very light and fluffy you dont see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the churchillfairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 tv version is the superior emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriets proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchills in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims for emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage for frank churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret in the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrows is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsales awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult both versions are very good but i prefer this one
actress ruth romans real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the korean war at an air base near san francisco jump-started this all-star warner bros salute to patriotism and song many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny air force corporal ron hagerthy who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle seems the corporal has fooled the actress into thinking hes off to battle when actually hes part of a airplane carrier crew flying to and from honolulu youd think shed be happy he was staying out of harms way but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies doris day is around for the first thirty minutes or so and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant roman is also here looking glamorous while james cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sings in his handsome baritone jane wyman sings too in a hospital bedside reprise following doris days lead causing one to wonder did they run out of sets for undemanding viewers an interesting flashback to another time and place still the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render starlift strictly a second-biller *12 from ****
ok forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the space shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold forget the hideous special effects and poorly-constructed one-dimensional characters just looking at the premise of the story the very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was pieced togetheri know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it the story is horrible the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible and whats worse is that the cable movie channels keep showing it! its on twice a day every two or three days! why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times much less to see it at allmy recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing its just not worth it
have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to outdo it the cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career even the many charms of ms diaz dont provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid its obviously a style of film that americans havent really got a grasp of watch the final result if you must and youll see what im talking about but dont say i didnt warn you
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained
generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs problem is nicholas cage there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cages shifting accent and out of control body language cage simply never settles into his role he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and thats whats needed in a love story cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character cage keeps taking these roles perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesnt lend itself to them though hes gotten better at it with repeated attempts he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self
every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing before davis co-stars with leslie howard in of human bondage shed been in over a score of movies legend has it that davis was robbed of a 1935 oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress unwed mother & manipulative boyfriend-user mildred rogers the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her 1st oscar for playing joyce heath in dangerous i imagine davis fans of of human bondage who agree with the oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critiques contrast of the 1934 film for which the afi didnt award her performance & the 1936 film dangerous performance for which she received her 1st oscar in 1937ive tried to view all of bette davis motion pictures tv interviews videos advertisements for wwii & tv performances in popular series in hindsight it is easy to recognize why this film of human bondage gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance she was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach hollywoods red carpet the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in of human bondage that is what makes it her legendary performance but rko saw her greatness in the man who played god & borrowed her from warners to play rogersim going to go with the afi in hindsight some 41 years after their astute decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for dangerous 2 years later by doing so the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywoods most talented 20th century actors because from of human bondage onward davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue doubtless she deserved more than 2 oscars; perhaps as many as 6dangerous provides an exemplary contrast in davis depth of acting characterization for its in dangerous 1936 that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century davis is so good as joyce heath shes dead-center on the red carpet whereas in of human bondage davis is right off the edge still on the sidewalk & ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting careerperhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in 1935 instead of a star being born an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actors greatest workit is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford; a star whose performances still dont measure up to davis even anna nicole smith was a star howard stern is a radio host star too lots of people on stage & the silver screen are stars few became great actors the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star-strucktry comparing these two movies as i have viewing one right after the other maybe youll recognize what the afi & i did davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo & achieved her goal by the time she was 27 she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached yethad the afi sent her the message that shed arrived in of human bondage davis life history as a great actor may have been led into star-struck-dom instead
must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot troubling to follow sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together filmi can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time
i thought the movie was actually pretty good i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell i have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related the acting was pretty good the fx and stunts were well done a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst and the boy who played the child these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok
really really bad slasher movie a psychotic person escapes from an asylum three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene one semester yesterday later hey thats what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school she makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor the students are all bored as are wethere are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there and also at least one of the dead people dont seem to have been missed by othersthe killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead is his knife poisoned or somethingthe video box cover has a cheerleader: there arent any in the movie the rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room the central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene the killer is strictly one-on-one
the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini-series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv its actually not long enough in a way all of the major bases in the decades are covered and theyre all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides but it almost doesnt cover enough or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time for example the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs partly the marijuana later cocaine is really well presented but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to coveroverall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs pop-culture government intervention the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia all felt the wave of various drugs over the years and the interplay between all was very evident nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot- goes to endorse drugs outright but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun and then tragic about taking certain drugs the appearances of various staunch ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and americas connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not just say no because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them as for example oxycontin continues on in the marketplaceis it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary no but for some summertime tv viewing for the young ie my age who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago as well as for the old who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks careless times and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased which is not totally untrue but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social political and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving for better or obvious worse for enough of a fascinating view
i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform her humour is also to be appreciated she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism cant say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed all said apart from ariaunas performance it is indeed utter trash
hi everyone my names larissa im 13 years old when i was about 4 years old i watch curly sue and it knocked my socks of i have been watching that movie for a long time in fact about 30 minutes ago i just got done watching it alisan porter is a really good actor and i love that movie its so funny when she is dealing the cards every time i watch that movie at the end of it i cry its so said i know im only 13 years old but its such a touching story its really weird thats alisan is 25 years old now every time i watch a movie someone is always young and the movie comes out like a year after they make it and when u watch it and find out how old the person in the movie really is u wounder how they can go from one age to the next like harry potter that movie was also great but still daniel was about 12 years old in the first movie and i was about 11 so how could he go from 12 to 16 in about 4 years and im only 13 im not sure if he is 16 right now i think he is almost 18 but thats kind of weird when u look at one movie and on the next there about 4 years old then u when they were only 1 in the lastim not sure i have a big imagination and i like to revile iti am kind of a computer person but i like to do a lot of kids things also i am very smart like curly sue in the movie but one thing i dont like in the movie is when that guy calls the foster home and makes curly sue get taken away i would kill that guy if he really had done it in real life well im going to stop writing i know a write a lot sometimes but kids do have a lot in there head that need to get out and if they dont kids will never get to learnlarissa
problem child is one of the goofiest movies ever made its not the worst though some people will disagree with me on that but its not the best either its about a devilish 7-year-old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple john ritter amy yasbeck who foolishly adopts him this film is too silly and unbelievable because i dont buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film its asinine and preposterous although i did laugh several times throughout i really dont know why but i cant recommend this film i know im being too kind to it if there is one positive thing about problem child is that its better than the sequel which was just awful ** out of four
this movie was made for fans of dani and cradle of filth i am not one of them i think hes just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still im generally not a fan of black metal but as i was carrying this dvd case to pay for it i convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing thus i assumed im in for a roller-coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister background now that is what i do likei got home and popped it in my patience lasted 15 minutes awful camera work and disgusting quality and that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a hi8 camcorder i left it on the shelf maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture after a couple of months i got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me my disliking evolved i noticed how funny dani 165m; 55 height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart yes ripping his head apparently had no skull i also found that this movie may have no sense still i havent finished it yet so i wasnt positiveafter a couple more tries i finally managed to finish this flick - a couple of months back yes it took me 55 years so - dani in fact was funny as satanmansonsuper-evil-mans helper and the movie did not make sense see our bad person employs dani to do bad things he delivers why well i guess hes just very very bad as a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much itwe have a couple of short stories joined by danis character my favourite was about a guy who steals someones leg because he wants to use it as his own yeah exactly the actings rock bottom the cgi is the worst ever i mean stinger beats it and boy is stingers cgi baaaaad the story has no sense and the quality is lets just say it is not satisfying the only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore blood and guts are made pretty well why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on example - dani the man filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as can be - and guts it and then eats what fell out why we never know we do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his sizeyou might think after my comment that this movie is so bad its good but its just bad cradle of filth fans can add 3 points i added one for gore

this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard griecorexdead easy04 decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot sexy waitress while rex steps out of the cafe he sees a state trooper and asks himare you fast and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one nancy allen maggie hewittdressed to kill80 is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down western style with the local top cop in town this is a different film however nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together!
i saw the omen when i was 11 on tv i enjoyed the trilogy so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for tv film however being a fan i couldnt resist but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter risible dialogue such as it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god what nonsenseno decent set pieces faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell no suprises and no fun however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it wastruly pathetic1 out of 10
i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless: why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy this is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of steven biko and the journalism of donald woods it also gives an important lesson of free speech: you can blow out a candle but you cant blow out a fire once the flame begins to catch the wind will blow it higher from biko by peter gabriel on shaking the tree
when rodney dangerfield is on a roll hes hilarious in my 5 wives hes not on a roll the timing of the one-liners is off but theyre the best thing going for the movie the five women who play the wives dont add up to one whole actress between them the plot is very weak even the premise is pretty weak; there are a few jokes about having multiple wives but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie most of the movie could play the same way even if rodneys character had only one wife so the premise seems more like an old mans fantasy than a key part of the comedy another old mans fantasy: were supposed to accept that rodneys character is an athletic skierjerry stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for workthe odd nods to political correctness later in the movie dont really do anything for the movie for those who like their movies politically correct the non-pc humor is still there in the first place and the seeming apologies for it still dont get the point for those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness the pc add-ins are just annoying digressionsthis has to be the mildest r-rated movie ive ever seen there are some racy jokes and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking tv 40 years ago but thats about it maybe it was the topless men kiddingthe dvd features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles i kept wondering if they were serious or kidding they seem to be serious but i kept thinking they must be kidding! theres also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the mormons or the church of latter-day saints that somehow its not about them never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in utah and makes reference to brigham youngin short my 5 wives was a disappointment i was hoping for rodney on a roll but the best i can say for the movie is that rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time
i can hardly believe that this inert turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works ive quite enjoyed the experience of enduring the lady and the duke and no other word but enduring will do left me in a vile mood a condition relieved only by reading the imdb user comment by ali-112 for not only has rohmer attempted with success to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century france but as ali has pointed out has shown at the cost of alienating his audience the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times the director has accomplished something undeniably difficult but i question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor
if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodeska-den it was making it with the partnership he formed with the four knights the other three being kobayaski ichikawa and konishita they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative woes that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didnt stop delivering what hes infamous for with his dramas: the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldnt be ignored but its not at all a fault of kurosawasthe material in dodeska-den is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot theres things that happen to these people and kurosawas challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as theres not much room for him to grow is rokkuchan a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds the clickety-clack of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off: theres the father and son the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house; an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on hes lost a lot more than hell tell most people including a woman who has a past with him; a shy quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father or uncle im not sure who rapes her; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social aroundthere are also little markers of people around these characters like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their spouses sometimes unintentionally swapping them! and theres the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course theres a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless its about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture; its a little post-apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets its a marginalized society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow sorrowful eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with itsometimes theres charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with rokkuchan specifically with kurosawas cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise his camera movements still remain as theyve always been- patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them ie the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like its one of his paintings lush sprawling spilling at times over the seams but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter; its like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath its a brilliant tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty dramawith a sweet movie score toru takemitsu also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career dodeska-den is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality
this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that ive gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the 3-d segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold cameosthe only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that were given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father alice cooperother than that all bad there are some quality actors in here lisa zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i cant ever get back
i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal so for the kink value i give it oneotherwise the video photography acting of the adults actors actresses are simply substandard a practical jock to people who love foreign moviesroberto the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being unbelievablehowever the children in the movie are mostly 34 years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life
i went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was it was a combination of every horrorthriller cliché trying to comment on many things including pedophilia satan worship undercover cops affairs religion and it was a mess the acting was pretty washboard; the kid and the jesus dude were alright but apart from them anyways i admire the effort though slightly failed on the attempt at showing the christian people in a different wayeven though they did that the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish but then again it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid no actually ive decided its just all around bad music oh my gosh horrible toooo over-dramatic okay i felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier; it seemed like a poor student project im going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap there you go
im not usually one to slate a film i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones but in this case there are almost no good points in my opinion if youre going to make something that bad why bother part of the film is take up with shots of annes face while she breaths deeply and violin music plays in the background the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting rupert penry jones is expressionless jennifer higham plays annes younger sister with modern mannerisms anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing which is fine at the beginning but she stays the same all through the film and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her overall the production lacks any sense of period with too many mistakes to be overlooked such as running out of the concert kissing in the street running about in the streets with no hat on why was this scene in the film at all the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written to sum it up a terrible film very disappointing
lorenzo lamas stars as jack `solider` kelly an ex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even those arent any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs followed by an improved sequel
how sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be as soon as a few critics say something new is good ie - shake-cam everyone jumps on the bandwagon as if they are devoid of independent thought this was not a good movie it was a dreadful movie 1 plot - what plot bourne was chased from here to there from beginning to end thats the plot dont look for anything deeper than this 2 cinematography - do me a favor! any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job i am not exaggerating here this film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work the ridiculous shaking of every i really do mean every scene will cause dizziness and nausea 3 believable - oh yes definitely this is a masterpiece of credibility i loved scenes about bourne being chased by local police through the winding market streets of tangier - ive been to tangier even the guides cant navigate their way through those streets but bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples 4 editing - i dont know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some! - every scene is between 05 and 2 seconds i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the scenes flashing by 5 directing - hmmm this is an interesting aspect the film appears to have actually not had any directing more a case of greengrass throwing a copy of the script all two pages at the cameramen and told to shoot a few scenes whilst drunk - dont worry boys well tie the scenes together in the editing room the editor should be tarred feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 not one but two senior cia operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood jason bourne - putting their lives on the line for someone they couldnt even be sure wasnt a traitor talk about stupid nincompoops whilst the evil male cia members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor well all men are evil arent they - except for snags of course yes this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity 7 when the you-know-what finally hits the fan good triumphs over evil just like it always does eh and the would-be assassin gets the drop on jason bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger yeah - right - at that very moment the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger - how did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath wonders will never cease 8 dont worry theres a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts well we cant have nasty politically incorrect cia operatives going round shooting people can we how lovely to see a true to life pc film of the noughties -------------the bourne ultimatum is utter rubbish
if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably delirious you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphys delirious and raw not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that im older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things: everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard thats the huge difference: eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful  and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was the king and delirious was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time
stargate sg-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie stargate i am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject the show gets it rolling from the very first episode a retired jack oneill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion dr daniel jackson through the first two episodes we meet samantha carter a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her and there is tealc a quiet compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team the main bad guys are called the gouald they are parasites who can get inserted into ones brain thus controlling them and doing evil deeds any gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a system lord the warriors behind the gouald are called jaffa who house the parasitic gouald in their bodies until the gouald can get inserted in a persons brainthrough the episodes we mostly get to see sg-1 the exploratory team comprised of jackdanieltealcand sam go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets this device is called the stargate and they encounter new cultures or bad guys some episodes are on-world meaning that they do not go through the stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on earththrough the years you start to see a decline in the sg-1 team as close knit and more character-building story lines this in turn means even more on-world episodes which is perfectly understandablemy rating: 87510----while most of this show is good there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years but still top notch science fiction!
its not braveheart thankfullybut it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around i enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last weekfind it has held up well over time not a classic filmbut a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment
i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperordarth sidious he is about to be destroyed when darth vader dark lord of the sith eliminates his dark master a nice sacrifice the cinematography of this film is impressive i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari the ewoks the sullesteian landos co pilot and many more most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded 2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker sebastian shawthe greatest scene in star wars 3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lordi personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader vs luke skywalker on the death star post-script: the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable 910
seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen they stammer and pause and stammer some more only for really die-hard denero fans! it tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very very low budget film made by college students the most often used word in the whole film is hum the film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixtiesearly seventies though if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other horrible lighting even if it is for arts sake and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting then you might like this - but you need to be really bored i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why
dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie ive ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie arent writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever
as alan rudolphs breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordons mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable its surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughter-house five mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why its brilliant! it stays almost entirely faithful to vonneguts book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any authors work can claim that vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better endorsement than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s its a mournful inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night - it doesnt even take a familiarity with vonneguts work to fully appreciate it as slaughter-house five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema
roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion i cant imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself includedpolanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since theres no tangible supernatural element here while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis be it cheap or more elaborate polanski sadistically tortures us and if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seatssuspense horror all this is a matter of playing with the audiences expectations alternatively fooling and fulfilling them not literally with peoples nerves in my book rosemarys baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat while we are forced to identify with a sole character whats more if the fantasy elements are all in the heros mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we the viewers are compelled to judge him reject him while we have been masterfully lured paint n lure into being him
blonde and blonder was unfunnybasically it was a rip-off girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and musicway too much background noises and music if you ask me!!!!it starts out immensely boring and totally inaneit doesnt pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried onmaybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutesi found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end but that was the only partalso i couldnt help but like pamela anderson and denise richards characters a littleeven though this movie didnt get any laughs from me it kept my attentioni wouldnt say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder
in a series chock-full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites its not the most profound episode theres no great meaning or message but its a lot of fun and there are some fine performancesbut what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the *only* twilight zone episode with a *double* snapper ending the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story but this time you get a surprise and think thats that but it turns out theres *another* surprise waiting i just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes the other being a deeper more message-oriented one
heavenly days commits a serious comedy faux pas: its desperate to teach us a civics lesson and it wont stop until weve passed the final exam fibber mcgee and molly take a trip to washington where they see the senate in action or inaction if you prefer have a spat with their senator eugene palette in one of the worst roles of his career get acquainted with a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children and meet a man on a train reading a book by henry wallace henry wallace!! a year later he was considered a near communist dupe but in 1944 he was a-ok add in some truly awful musical moments a whole lot of flagwaving hooey and a boring subplot about newspaper reporters and youve got a film that must have had philip wylie ready to pen generation of vipers 2: dc boogaloo drastically unfun heavenly days is another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes

i just got back from this free screening and this osama witch project is the hands-down worst film ive seen this year worse than even catwoman - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fictionin september tapes a film crew of documentary journalists heads to afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip the conditions and oh yeah the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wifes death on sept 11 - to track down osama bin ladenthey made eight tapes on their journey which now document their travels and of course their attempts to kill the terrorist leader the eight tapes thankfully all end at points significant in the narrative which is convenient for a documentarythe psychotic idiotic protagonist - who is given to long significant speeches that he probably learned watching macgyver - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps i dont know why he didnt just wear a sign on his back that said shoot methe crews translator supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom you wish theyd brought along someone on their trip to call them all moronsaround tape 4 i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew
deliverance is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970s decade from whence so many other exploitation films camea group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives its awesomewe are treated to anal rape vicious beatings bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like 1974s texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature this would never and could never happen even in the dark ages of 1972deliverance is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70s and it arguably sits on top of that pile with its great acting superb cinematography and excellent writing8 out of 10 kids
well well well as good as john carpenters season 1 outing in masters of horror was this is the complete opposite he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with cigarette burns but pro-life is perhaps the worst i have seen from himits stupid totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays its welcome despite the less-than-an-hour running time the script is nonsense the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurdand for those suckers who actually bought the dvd one of them being me; did you see how carpenter describes the film hes actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time and he praises the script and in the commentary track where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut he just says he didnt feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there i fear the old master has completely lost his touch i sincerely hope im proved wrongi want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome though technically speaking this film is top notch with effective lighting schemes and make up effects
i wonder who how and more importantly why the decision to call richard attenborough to direct the most singular sensation to hit broadway in many many years hes an academy award winning director yes he won for ghandi you moron! jeremy irons is an academy winning actor do you want to see him play rocky balboa he has experience with musicals really oh what a lovely war have you forgotten to answer your question yes! the film is a disappointment clear and simple not an ounce of the live energy survived the heavy handedness of the proceedings every character danced beautifully they were charming but their projection was theatrical i felt nothing but when i saw it on stage i felt everything the film should have been cast with stars unknown newcomers but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group great actors who could dance beautifully well michael douglas was in it true i forgot im absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right nothing like a richard attenborough michael douglas musical
my flatmate rented out this film the other night so we watched it togetherthe first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy post-mtv texture fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves - for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another snatch for the momentwhen the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one over-dosed amphetamine things just dont make sense anymore i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching itfirst you think it is a crime story recounted in a conversation between keira knightley and lucy liu wrong this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever rather on the contrary dominos lesbian come on on lucy lius character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusionthen i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter in any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes but after that the question of dominos character is entirely lost to the criminal plot so in short no this is not a movie about dominos characterthen i thought its probably a story of one robbery a pretty bloody robbery 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates etc but soon this impression is dispelled by another u-turn of the plotthis time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese afro-american woman who fakes drivers licenses at the local mvd and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother lateesha stars on jerry springer show tries to publicize some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughterwhat does this have to do with the main plot urgh well nobody knows except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors fee of 300000then at some point you start to think: oh it is about our society and the way media distorts things there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes but no this is not a movie about media they just appear sporadically throughout the movieplus there are numerous other sub-plots: the crazy afghani guy bent on liberating afghanistan the love story between domino and chocco the mescaline episode the fbi surveillance operationcan all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear - it is a veritable mess!
pam grier stars as coffy shes a nurse who seeks revenge on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine like any 70s blaxploitation flick you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts there were scores of these films made during the 70s and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike this is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films and the degrading stereotypical characters especially the female characters other common threads between coffy and other films of its type include brutal violence corrupt cops car chases a generous abundance of nudity and sex-crazed gorgeous women not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers pimps mobsters and other criminal scumpam grier was the undisputed queen of 70s blaxploitation heroines she was magnificent being both tough-as-nails and drop-dead gorgeous like in her other films pam outshines the other characters in coffy in fact pam is so charismatic on screen that these sorts of films are unwatchable without her as the main character if you like pam grier youre better off seeing her other films like foxy brown or perhaps friday foster these films have much less empty sleaze than coffy does pams character in coffy degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys pams characters in her other blaxploitation films dont stoop as low to get revenge as coffy did id say only watch coffy if youre unable to see any of pam griers other films otherwise coffy is a waste of time only pams talent as an actress makes viewing coffy bearable
i do not recommend this movie because its inaccurate and misleading this story was supposed to be in algerian berber territory this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert completetly different culture i know i am from both tunisia and algeria the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage so living as a bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the femme repudiee segment which is s pure invention from the writerdirector things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever!!!
en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the womans husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed onthe zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and thats not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy with joe haggerty as the tale-telling ebenezer jackson giving one of the strangest performances i have ever seen; the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; theres a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending well that beggars beliefto be fair some of sykes creative camera-work is effective although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused and joe castros cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles aint a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trashi give the zombie chronicles 210 but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didnt get to view the film with the benefit of 3d although i have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldnt have made that much of a difference
its 1982 two years after the iranian embassy siege which involved the dramatic sas rescue from the balconys and with a war with argentina over the falkland islands currently taking place what better film to make than a gung-ho sas film that re-creates the iranian hostage siege whilst using britains number one action hero of the day lewis collins throw in edward woodward and a few other well known actors and youve got a winner on your handswell maybe not! the film itself doesnt make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate its like a movie long episode of the professionals but without the formula this film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable maybe cubby brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch lewis collins as a touted james bond replacement for roger moore watch it if your a fan of lewis collins or sas stuff in general if not save your time
what do i say about such an absolutely beautiful film i saw this at the atlanta georgia dragoncon considering that this is my main town i am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type films i happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when i noticed this film playing in the morning this is not a sci-fi nor action film of any sort let me just start out by saying that i am not a fan of witchblade nor of eric etebari having watched a few episodeshis performance in that seemed stale and robotic but he managed to really win me over in this performance i mean really win me over having seen cellular i did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy but his performance as kasadya was simply amazing he was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon but there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me i later looked it up online and found that eric won the best actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect now i keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that i did not pay attention to them sorry brian they were very nicely done but i was even more impressed with the story - which i think was even more his goalseeing films like godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off i could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head the situation of an abusive family is never an easy one i showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so having lived with abuse this is one film that i think about constantly and would highly recommend
this has to be creepiest most twisted holiday film that ive ever clapped eyes on and thats saying something i know that the mexican people have some odd ideas about religion mixing up ancient aztec beliefs with traditional christian theology but their day of the dead isnt half as scary as their take on santa claussosanta isnt some jolly fat red-suited alcoholictake a look at those rosy cheeks sometime! rather hes a skinny sociopathic pedophile living in heavenor the heavens whichever with a bunch of kids who work harder than the ones in kathy lee giffords sweat shops they sing oh-so-cute traditional songs of their homelands while wearing clothing so stereotypical that i was surprised there wasnt a little african-american boy in black face singing mammy this santa is a peeping tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his eye in the sky this is so he can tell whos been naughty or nicewith an emphasis on those who are naughty id bettheres no mrs claus no elveswhat does he need elves for when hes got child labor and the reindeer are mechanical wind-up toys! this floating freak show hovers on a cloud presumably held up by its silver liningsantas nemesis isthe devil! what is this santa our lord and savior weird anyhoo satan sends one of his minions a mincing prancing devil named pitch to try to screw up christmas let me get this straight-the forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday seems kind of redundant doesnt itpitch is totally ineffectual he tries to talk some children into being bad but doesnt have much luck i was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl lupe whos family is very poor all that she wants is a doll for christmas but he parents cant afford to buy her onethey spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of so pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll in reality thats the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll because being saintly and praying to god and holy santa doesnt really work but lupe resists temptation and tells pitch to get thee behind her and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that its chuckys sisteralong the way pitch manages to get santa stuck in a treeuh-huh from whence hes rescued by merlin! merlin you have got to be kidding me! since when do mythical druidic figures appear in christmas tales or have anything to do with a christian religion and doesnt god disapprove of magic theyd have been burning merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago not asking him to come to the rescue of one of gods aspectsor thats what i assume santa must be to be going up against satan this movie is one long huh from start to finish and itll make you wonder if that eggnog you drank wasnt spiked or something probably it was since this movie is like one long giant dt
shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film ive seen all year its about a prison program somewhere in california if i recall correctly where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years the film follows their production of the tempest from casting through performance and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men who are all in for the most serious of crimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film the audience would never buy it but knowing that its real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally; i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felons crime its like some loopy episode of oz and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real
this isnt the comedic robin williams nor is it the quirkyinsane robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with robins new love of the thriller but this isnt a thriller per se this is more a mysterysuspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeperalso starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until williams character gets close to achieving his goali must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the storyall in all its worth a watch though its definitely not fridaysaturday night fareit rates a 7710 fromthe fiend :
an american in paris is a showcase of gene kelly watch as gene sings acts and dances his way through paris in any number of situations some purely majestic others pure corn one can imagine just what kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before singin in the rain he is definately one of the all time greats it is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in kellys characters the only main difference being that one is based in paris the other in lasome have said that leslie carons acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levants short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesnt look like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isnt an easy task yet levant did it with as much class as any other leadthe song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasnt much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if youd spent four hours with them ingenious!i would have to rate this film up with singin since it is very similar in story and song singin would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performancefull recommendation810 stars
well chuck jones is dead lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions an american drawn anime knock off style and give them superpowers but sir dont we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less dont dump all over their original creators dreams yes! and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more! but wont every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed hay youre right! set it in the future make them all descendents of the original characters and change all the names slightlybut not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classicswell thats the only reason i can think of why this even exists if you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved looney toons then it looks like an ok show but then there is already the teen titans which is the same bloody thing all the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have superpowers only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traitsthis kind of thing falls into the its so ridiculous its good kind of category think of the super mario brothers movie and batman and robin if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out if you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness then run with it and enjoyif you enjoy this cartoon i dont have a problem with you its the people who calculated this thing together that i am mad at you know how they say piracy is like stealing a car; this show is like grave robbing they might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up in err pirate costumes and charged money if this show wasnt using characters ones that didnt resemble the looney toons in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine but no! for shame warner brothers for shameif i saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the simpsons or family guy i would love it as it is i just cant believe this was ever made i would bet anyone that 80% of the people who work on this show hate it but whatever it doesnt really matter in 10 years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world endscoming 2008 snoopy and the peanut gang are back and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible! can charley brown defeat the evil alien warlord zapar tune in and see
domestic import was a great movie i laughed the whole time it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations the acting was great alla korot larry dorf howard hesseman and all the others did an awesome job because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer it doesnt have the clichés that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious and amazing! i highly recommend this movie
i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must see for any fan of 70s rock i hope me and my friends arent like that in twenty years!bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spiritstephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding wellif you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you you wont regret seeing this movie i know i dont even my family found it funny and thats saying something
anyone who knows me even remotely can tell you that i love bad movies almost as much as i love great ones and i can honestly say that i have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movies: the almost indescribable mess that is myra breckinridge an adaptation of gore vidals best-selling book he later disowned this film version the star-studded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end the x-rated movie about sex change operations and hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of its release not surprisingly the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema and i was actually quite excited to finally see for the first timedirector michael sarne who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve the film is often incoherent with entire sequences edited together in such a half-hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals this means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as judy garland and shirley temple laced into newly-film scenes of often lewd sexual acts and the process just doesnt work as intended this also caused a minor uproar as actors such as temple and loretta young sued the studio for using their image without permissionperhaps sarne is not the only one to blame however as the films screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief for instance this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic rex reed in his first and last major film role could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess raquel welch! the film becomes further hard to follow when welch as myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle played by legendary film director john huston seduce a nubile female film student farrah fawcett and teach the schools resident bad boy roger herren a lesson by raping him with a strap-on dildo did everyone follow that and it gets even better or worse depending upon your perspective! i have yet to mention the films top-billed star: the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen-thirties mae west! ms west was 77 year old when she appeared in this film she had been retired for 26 years and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men including a young tom selleck throwing themselves at her as if this werent bad enough the tone-deaf west actually performs two newly-written songs about halfway through the film and i think that i might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! naturally none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as good but i would give myra breckinridge a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when i had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on also most of the cast tries really hard raquel in particular appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful that she single-handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching if she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form criticsthe rest of the cast is also fine the endearingly over-the-top john huston who really should have been directing the picture has some funny moments rex reed isnt bad for a non-actor and farrah fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable roger herren is also fine but he never appeared in another movie again after this i guess he just couldnt live down being the guy who was rapped by raquel welch and as anyone could guess from the description above mae west was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but thats part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema
if in the 90s youre adapting a book written in the 50s set the bloody thing in the 50s and not the 90s see 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well or ring as true that far down the road its a simple rule that hollywood habitually keeps violating and thats the problem with this film it should have been set in the era it was written in youd think that would be a no-brainer but nooo id elaborate but bmacvs comment spells it out quite well ill limit my commentary to rachel ward she looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role as a result she looks like a crack ho on chemotherapy and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag i found her i could die at any moment look quite disconcerting and it greatly detracted from her supposed hotness and the sexual tension the film intended to create other than that the film was quite good; a 7+ out of 10
well no i tell a lie this is in fact not the best movie of all time but it is a really enjoyable movie that nobody i know has seenits a buddy cop movie starring jay leno and pat moritamr miyagi with some fluff story about a missing car engine prototype or something but that doesnt matter the reason this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leads who initially dislike and distrust each other but in a shocking twist of fate end up becoming friends the whole culture difference thing is done quite wellin that its fun to watch its completely ridiculous but in a cheesy and enjoyable kind of way the soundtrack is coolonce again in a cheesy 80s kind of way it suits the movie ive been trying to find one of the songs for ages but as im working from memory of what i think a few of the words were i cant seem to find itanother thing this movie has is the most fantastic pay off of any movie ever but i wont give that one away oh no! in conclusion id take this movie over 48 hoursmost of eddie murphys output including beverly hills cop and whatever buddy junk jackie chan or martin lawrence have to their names if youre looking for a buddy cop movie and are getting fed up with straight white cop meets zany streetwise black cop give this a shot you might be pleasantly surprised cos this turns the whole formula upside down with straight japanese cop meets zany streetwise white copim giving this 7 to be honest i like it more than that id rather watch this than a lot of stuff id give 8 but i guess i know deep down that its some sort of insanity that makes me like this movie
snow white which just came out in locarno where i had the chance to see it of course refers to the world famous fairy tale and it also refers to coke in the end real snow of the swiss alps plays its part as wellthus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film there is a lot of dope on scene and there is also a pale dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescuebut: its not a fairy tale its supposed to be a realistic drama located in zurich switzerland according to the taglinetechnically the movie is close to perfect unfortunately a weak plot foreseeable dialogs a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting dont add up to create authenticity thus as a spectator i remained untouchedand then there were the clichés which drove me crazy one by one: snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were so busy all the time her best girlfriend on the other hand has loving and caring parents they a steelworker and a housewife live in a tiny flat poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in the good guy = prince is a musician ! from the french speaking part of switzerland which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country he has problems with his parents they are migrants from spain who dont seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bedand so it goes on: naturally the drug dealer is brutal the bankers are heartless the club owner is a playboy and the photographer although a woman ! has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a showthis review doesnt need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot as i like other films by samir eg forget baghdad i was quite disappointed lets hope for the next one
wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first filmmakers attempt at making a pseudo art video to give you a couple of examples: 1 david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content blank walls up shots with ceiling in the background 2 david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video cameras hum in fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie unlessthis is a joke on davids part to force fans search his website for hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny
this movie is just truly awful the eye-candy that plays ben just can make up for everything else that is wrong with this moviethe writerdirectorproducerlead actor etc probably had a good idea to create a movie dealing with the important issues of gay marriage family acceptance religion homophobia hate crimes and just about every other issue effecting a gay man of these times but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly conceived film does little justice to any of these causesthe script is poor the casting very ordinary but the dialogue and acting is just woeful the homo-hating brother is played by the most camp actor and there is absolutely no chemistry between the two lead actors i think ive seen more passion in an corn flakes ad the acting is stiff and the dialogue forced a scene where the brother is feeding the detective his lines was the highlightim just pleased to see that the creator of this train wreck has not pushed any other rubbish out in to distribution and if he is thinking of doing so i have some advise - just dont do it
it helps if you understand czech and can see this in the original language and understand the czechs obsession with the professionals but if not jedna ruka netlaska is yet another great czech film it is funny dark and extremely enjoyable the highest compliment i can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewingfor a small country the czech republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature from hrabal hasek and kundera to the films of menzel sverak and numerous others czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it this film is just that it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise good intent and optimismi highly recommend this and most other projects trojan and machacek are involved in enjoy it its a film made for just that reason - anyway its as close as the czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending
halfway through lajos koltais evening a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: can you tell me where my life went the line could be embarrassingly theatrical but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave delivering it with utter simplicity and the question tears your heart outtime and again the film based on susan minots novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness it holds attention offers admirable performances and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have with only six months of the year gone there are now two memorable meaningful worthwhile films in theaters the other of course being sara polleys away from her hollywood might have turned evening into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson and meryl streep and mamie gummer richardson is redgraves daughter in the film with a sister played by tony collette and gummer plays streeps younger self while redgraves youthful incarnation is claire danesadd glenn close eileen atkins hugh dancy patrick wilson and a large cast - yes it could have turned into a multiple star platform instead koltai - the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of mephisto and director of fateless - created a subtle ensemble work with a continental feel the story taking place in a high-society newport environment in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with troublemissed connections wrong choices and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera but the quality of the writing koltais direction and selfless acting raise evening way above that level into the the rarified air of english french and a few american family sagas from a century before its contemporary settingcomplex relationships between mothers and daughters between friends and lovers with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly understandably captivatingly individual tunes are woven into a symphonyand yet with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances the stars of evening still shine through redgrave richardson gummer an exciting new discovery looking vaguely like her mother but a very different actress danes carrying most of the load - until streep shows up in the final moments and of course steals the show dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission tooas with away from her evening stays with you at length inviting a re-thinking its story and characters and re-experiencing the emotions it raises at two hours the film runs a bit long but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn
the minute you give an art film 110 you have people baying for your ignorant half-ass-ed artistically retarded blood i wont try and justify how i am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema i have liked or mentioning how i gave some unknown cult classic a 1010 all i ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this filmhere is how i would summarize the film: opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co-incidence this followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following - a childrens game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game-shows star contestant decides that he doesnt want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game shows producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as mr producers second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man; and oh eventually it rains frogs you read correctly and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a modern epic you are probably thinking that i could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if i had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one well now you know how i feel
when i heard patrick swayze was finally returning to his acting career with king solomons mines i was very excited i was expecting a great indiana jones type action adventure what i got was a 4 hour long with commercials epic that was very slow the second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it the ending was good no spoilers herebut i was still left wanting more well all a guy can do is prey that swayze does roadhouse 2 so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous until than if your a fan of king solomons mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with richard chamberlain and sharon stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours
massacre is a film directed by andrea bianchi burial ground and produced by legendary italian horror director lucio fulci now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest this could not be further from that massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films i have seen come out of italian cinema i was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and i have never had that problem with italian horror filmsmassacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax this scene was used in fulcis nightmare concert this isnt a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter unfortuanitly the next hour of the movie is so boring the movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away the last 30 minutes of the movie arent so bad but still could have been much better the gore in the movie was pathetic and since fulci used most of the gore scenes in nightmare concert there was nothing new here the end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floorthis wasnt a very good film but for a true italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare 410 stars
i saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it ive been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half personally i enjoyed the first story too bad that wasnt extended the second story i thought was cliched and that california dreaming if i hear that one more time chungking express is alright but its not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see like crouching tiger
bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of springtime for hitlerthe girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the originalif you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls
apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe pacinos producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeares birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act - but apparently its how al really behaves in personenough rambling heres a shotgun smattering of why i didnt even make it 34 of the way through this: 1 pretentious - al always knows when the camera is on him whether hes acting as richard or in a real conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside its unbearable look at me chewing all the scenery! 2 winona ryder when she appears as lady anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture of course you also learn that pacino shouldnt be directing films or doing richard in the first place id rather watch bobby deerfield than thislastly read the play and learn it for yourself go out and see it performed in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of clarence! my god! was that necessary!its all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada
carlito way the original is a brilliant story about an ex-drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with itthis film wasi saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be badbut after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great lucky number slevin tokyo drifti gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutesthe script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepareit was weak with weaker dialogue it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie so brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girland she says yes! and if you need to act bad just throw racism aroundas we learn from the italian mobstersthe acting was terrible to say the leasti found hollywood nicky hilariousi absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies lets face it the only reason p diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangstersthe actress who plays leticia was weak but beautiful the sex scene was weak but we got to see herwhich was okaybut overall i expected it shed light on how carito ended up in prison and the love of his lifeand the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that iscarlitos way: rise to power

it makes the actors in hollyoaks look like the royal shakespeare company this movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is turning the dvd player off was not a sufficient course of action i want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face i will never get that time back never how is it possible to create such a banal boring and soulless film i could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema what more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is please avoid
i dont want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said but this is one of the best series ever! it was a great shame when it was canceled and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again the good news is that it is out on dvd!!!! i rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as i remembered it gary cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character and all actors were very good it is a shame that the network did not continue it shaun cassidy this is a masterpiece anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it must do so you will not be disappointed my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television she is 20 is becoming very interested and will soon be a fan she finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not airedthis show rocks!!!!
i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contractshe decided to take the money but her career suffered accordinglythat might explain what she was doing in comet over broadway though it doesnt explain why donald crisp and ian hunter are in it too ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and thats right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part logically leads to the next partalso the sets and costumes looked like b-movie stuff and her hair! turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and youll be doing yourself a favor
a woman mujar marta belengur enters a restaurant one morning at &:35 unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant & is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the directorwriters equally fascinating timecrimes it had a fairly catchy song & it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short im glad that i stumbled across it wasnt aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd and wouldnt hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my friendsmy grade: a-
this movie is an insult to all submariners it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i weep for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you havent figured it out yet i didnt like it and if it wasnt for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post
bruce almighty one of carreys best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is messing up the anchor mans voicemy rating: 810
this movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting it is a slow moving film set like an episode of wonder years with appalling lack of depth though it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing mannerthe approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty according to the makers of this movie beauty can be only experienced in bob-ross-style kitschy landscape paintings good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment in parts the movie is offending eg at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless bullshit quotei do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades
this movie has it all action fighting dancing bull riding music pretty girls this movie is an authenic look at middle america believe me i was there in 1980 lots of oil money lots of women and lots of honky tonks too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie and that includes american graffiti it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it every time i watch it i am young again and it is time to go out honky tonking the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero i do not feel you should rate one 10
riding giants is an amazing movie it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun they didnt care about money jobs girls or any thing to them the waves were their girls i have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard i dont understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie if youre a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it it might be a documentary but it is really good -tara f-
this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as were not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools after the basic version download die hard fan here on a dial-up modem eventually got here i hit my first snag media player mplayer classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box and then totem xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server mplayer managed to run it flawlessly going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open itthe film beautiful soundtrack superb lighting masterful camera work and flawless texturing everything looked real and then the two main characters moved and spoke and the movie died for me everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters except for proog in the dancing scene looked fluid and totally alive the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-scenes that entail less realism than thisany frame in the movie is fantastic as a frame and the thing is great if neither actors are moving im so glad i havent actually recommended this to anyone id ruin my reputationoh and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plotthis movie would get 10 stars if it wasnt for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen
im always surprised about how many times youll see something about world war 2 on the german national television you would think they dont like to open old wounds but there isnt a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war perhaps its a way of dealing with their past i dont know but you sure cant blame them of ignoring what happened and it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies think for instance about der untergang or the downfall as you might now it which are also very realisticone of those movies is rosenstrasse it tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war even though the movie starts with a family in the usa at the present day after hannahs father died her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox jew even though she hasnt been very religious before she doesnt know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from but as she starts digging in her mothers troubled childhood hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mothers pastthe fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the nazi regime is already quite surprising for as far as i know there hasnt been another movie that deals with this subject for those who didnt know this yet: being married to a so-called pure aryian man or woman meant for many jews that they werent immediately sent to one of the concentration camps but that they had to work in a factory but it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives how difficult it sometimes was for them during the nazi regime and how these people most of the time women did everything within their power to free their men once they were captured and locked away in for instance the rosenstrassethe acting is really good and the story is very well written although the way it was presented in the beginning didnt really do it for me and thats exactly the only part that youll get to see in the trailer perhaps its just me but i would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day at least of the part that is situated in the usa because the part where hannah goes to berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mothers past definitely worksif you are interested in everything that has something to do with the second world war and if you arent necessarily looking for a lot of action shots than this is definitely a movie you should see this isnt a movie in which youll see any battles or gunfights but it certainly is an interesting movie because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of i give it an 810
if ever i was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years then it would have to be chalo di daar chalo chand ke paar chalo for its meaning the way it is sung by lata mangeshkar and mohd rafi the lyrics by kaif bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars the other would have to be chalte chalte pakeezah was meena kumaris last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen in each of the the songs that are picturised she looks young but after that she does not but one actor who didnt change in his looks was the late raj kumar who falls in love with her and especially her feet after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them he leaves a note describing how beautiful they areconclusion: pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs the movie stars the meena kumari raj kumar and ashok kumar and is directed by kamal amrohikamal amrohis grandson has now started to revive his grand fathers studio by making a comedy movie
of all movies and im a film graduate if thats worth anything to you this is the worst movie i have ever seen i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just havent seen yet but i have seen this and this is the worst a friend and i rented it one night because denise richards was on the cover talk about being young and retarded shes uncredited! her role was unbelievably small! how did she make it on the cover! imdb doesnt even list it in her filmography this movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case it read something like please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie!
six different couples six different love stories six different love angles eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screeni am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out whats going on in the movie all stories have got no link with each other but somewhere down the line nikhil advani trying to show some relation between them i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actuallymy suggestion dont watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie
this is short and to the point the story writing used for star trek: hidden frontier is surprisingly good acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills it is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid-may 2007i will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics considering this is all-volunteer for no profit it is pretty amazingif this was being ranked as a professional production i would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets however as a fan-based production i have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own for sheer volume i dont think this has been matched congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire
really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complementthis vampires hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss jon bon jovi travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers! he use some interesting weapons but nothing compared to blade and is part of some van helsig vampires hunters net ok but he work alone hes assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight is almost a sequel of vampires 1998 directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: sancho diego luna really bad acting also a teenager without experience father rodrigo cristian de la fuente a catholic priest zoey natasha wagner a particular vampire and ray collins darius mccrary another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isnt aloneyou can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor jon bon jovi; is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film i dont recommend this part you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events!i deeply recommend not to see this film! rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc310
when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool i was excited its been a personal favorite for years now and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism having just seen it though i was surprised to find that it worked while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superbespecial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast right down to henrys son who was only four in the original like i said though this movie is quite different from the first but it works: i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended in this case an unexpected adventure ensuesand thats about all ill give awaynot to mention the fact that ill need to see it again to really understand whats going on and whos double crossing who while it was certainly one of the better movies ive seen in some time it suffers like many sequels with its ending as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging ill be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 henry grim in 2017
hollow man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist dr sebastian caine kevin bacon finally works out how to make things visible again after having been turned invisible by his own serum they test the serum on an already invisible gorilla & it works perfectly caine & his team of assistants celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers caine wants to be the first invisible human he manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & caine becomes invisible however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible the team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory but then again hes invisible right he can do anything he wantsdirected by paul verhoeven i rather liked hollow man you know its just after christmas i saw this a few hours ago on late nightearly morning cable tv & worst of all i feel sick not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop ive had over the past week so ill keep this one brief the script by andrew w marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original the invisible man 1933 film which hollow man obviously owes a fair bit it manages to have a petty successful blend of horror sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes i thought the characters were ok i thought some of the ideas in the film were good although i think its generally known that verhoeven doesnt deal in subtlety the first thing he has the invisible caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has caine rape a woman with the justification whos going to know that caine says to himself then of course theres the gore he shows a rat being torn apart & thats just the opening scene after the credits to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it having said that i love horrorgoreexploitation films so hollow man delivers for me its just that it might not be everyones cup of teadirector verhoeven does a great job or should that be the special effects boys make him look good the special effects in hollow man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless their brilliant & its as simple & straight forward as that theres some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top i love the effect where kevin bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the gorilla theres a few gory moments including a rat being eaten someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering resultswith a staggering budget of about $95000000 hollow man is technically faultless i can imagine the interviews on the dvd where some special effects boffin says they mapped bacons entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldnt they the acting was ok bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guyhollow man is one of hose big budget hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or characters but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film well i know i do good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual hollywood product definitely worth a watch
panic in the streets is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director elia kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in new orleans using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation as a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable an important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken then increase the tension to a high levelfollowing a dispute between the participants in a card game a man called kochak lewis charles is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area when the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus us public health official dr clinton reed richard widmark is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action anyone infected could be expected to die within daysas the identity of the dead man is unknown the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the police commissioner are not fully convinced by reeds briefing they doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently the investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community a group of seamen the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the mans identity and his contacts are eventually foundkochak an illegal immigrant had been in a gang with blackie jack palance raymond fitch zero mostel and vince poldi tommy cook and when gang leader blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation he presumes that kochak mustve smuggled something very valuable into the country as kochak and poldi were related blackie assumes that poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more poldi however is very ill and unable to provide any information blackie brings in his own doctor and together with fitch starts to move poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with reed and an exciting chase followsrichard widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man in an unusual type of role for him he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of dr reed very convincingly jack palances film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges kochaks reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation his distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compellingin typical docu-noir style expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place elia kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside
charles mcdougalls resume includes directing episodes on sex and the city desperate housewives queer as folk big love the office etc so he comes with all the credentials to make the tv film version of meg wolitzers novel surrender dorothy a success and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react afloatsara alexa davalos a beautiful unmarried young woman is accompanying her best friends - gay playwright adam tom everett scott adams current squeeze shawn chris pine and married couple maddy lauren german and peter josh hopkins with their infant son - to a house in the hamptons for a summer vacation the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice creamery by adam and sara results in an auto accident which kills sara meanwhile saras mother natalie swedlow diane keaton who has an active social life but intrusively calls here daughter constantly with the mutual greeting surrender dorothy is playing it up elsewhere: when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the hamptons where her overbearing personality and grief create friction among saras friends slowly but surely natalie uncovers secrets about each of them thriving on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life natalies thirst for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the binding love of the departed sara that they all eventually come togetherdiane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together the screenplay has its moments for good lines but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and morose making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given yes this story has been told many times - the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose privacy is altered by disclosures - but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching grady harp
seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i didnt have much expectations when renting this filmbut contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a charming movie it didnt need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his moviestheres not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch filmvery recommended
wellnow that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his house of 1000 corpses crapfest i can now rest in peace nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ha! anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! in hell house sorry i dont remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago; some like arthritic lurch stand-in john carradine whose small role provides the films only worthwhile moments attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum the result comes across like satans school for girls catchy title; made-for-tv production values; intriguing plot crossed with children shouldnt play with dead things low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead; trouble is its nowhere near as entertaining or fun the house of seven corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second
be warned! this is crap that other crap wont even deign to be in company with because its beneath them! okay got that out of the way let me say something more substantiveive seen ashes of time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director wong kar wai well despite of all of that wkw hasnt succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water beads of sweats legs of horses running etc i couldnt sit through most of the moviefast forward many years later when i wanted to give mr wongs movies another shot after hearing many praises especially from cannes i was intrigued by his latest 2046 a friend told me to start w chungking express because it is his most accessible movies so wrong! i was just po that i got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city blah blah blah its all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it but no he merely shows what is faye wongs acting is very typical of hong kongs style: garbled enunciation deer in the headlight wide eye expression try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspiredi think the word auteur is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different which is to be applauded but not one who hasnt yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling which is what mr wong is for the last 17 years!
way way back in the 1980s long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities the united states and japan were at each others throat in the world manufacturing race remember sayings like union yes! the japanese are taking this country over and americans are lazyas the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash gung ho which drew over $36 million in us box office receipts while in many ways dated howards tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life todaygung ho focuses on hunt stevenson michael keaton the automakers union rep from hadleyville a small depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo similar to real-life toyota which is considering a us operation at the towns empty plant with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly linethe 112 minutes of gung ho is a humorous look at these two sides with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth in stevenson we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings with the survival of his workers jobs and most of hadleyville on the line stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble besides answering to the heads of assan we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members many of whom he grew up with this includes buster george wendt willie john turturro and paul clint howard rons brotherthe japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe also known for sixteen candles and volunteers watanabe plays kazihiro the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life he is constantly shadowed by saito sab shimono the nephew of assans ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order while given a light touch these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culturewith hunt stevenson dominating the script michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work gung ho is indeed a slam-dunk success for keaton who also teamed with ron howard in 1994s the paper he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included mr mom beetle juice and the dream team before venturing into batman one good cop and my life its also hard not to like gedde watanabes performance as the odd man out who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unitthe supporting cast is top-notch including wendt turturro shimono and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey hunts girlfriend edwin blum lowell ganz and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung hos solid writing the incidental music which received a bmi film music award was composed by thomas newman gung hos soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s including dont get me wrong tuff enuff and working class manthe success of gung ho actually led to a short-lived tv series on abc while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago ron howards film still has its comic value it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short-changed audio options are provided in english 51 surround english dolby surround and french dubbing but subtitles are in english only there are no extras not even the theatrical trailer on the plus side paramounts digital transfer is quite good with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound while a few extras would have been helpful - especially that gung ho was a box office success - theres little to complain about the film presentation itself*** out of 4
this is the best of shelley duvalls high-quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew brodericks prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although im not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve martins comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the shows flowas is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ages 15 and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it -- i found 3 times in one day to be a little too much
this movie promised bat people it didnt deliver there was a guy who got bit by a bat but what was with the seizures and the stupid transformation where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why was it allowed to be made why why i guess well never know
the premise of the story is simple: an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film the visual narrative told by the cameras eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness which complements the quietness of the characters themselves we can also sense helplessness in the old mans inability to convince the police of the murder which parallels the silenced childs inability to tell her own storytrue horror lies in feelings of hopelessness helplessness and irrationality this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weakcleverly the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films such as the ring and dark water or english horror films such as lady in black and the innocents this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a tryby the way if you havent seen the films i just mentioned above you might want to give them a try as well
theres really no way to beat around the bush in saying this lady death: the motion picture just plain sucks aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980s cartoon based on a line of action figures the bad guy himself even talks like a skeletor wannabe has the obligatory inept henchman and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old saturday morning blackstar cartoon just dont expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue at other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai yet there is no sex no tentacle rape thank goodness! and very little sex appeal this despite the physical appearance of the title character there is simply no adult edge to this material unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths essentially what we have here is a feature length episode of she-ra princess of power but with skimpier clothes and more gore
oh where to begin the cinematography was great when the movie first started because of the initial landscape scenes i thought that i was in for a good movie then the cgi bigfoot showed up it looked like a cartoon drawing of the lion king and king kongs love childit totally took away from the believability of the characternow i knew there wasnt a bigfoot chasing people hiking around the woods for no apparent reason but a cheesy cgi cartoonso from then on the whole movie was shot for methe money they flushed down the toilet for the cgi they could of spent on a costume like roger patterson did his was the best bigfoot costume ever no one else could match hisi am a hardcore cheesy bigfoot movie fan and i was warned about this movie but my compulsion led me to watching this movie and i was disappointed like the previous reviews warned me about i know after you read this review you will still say i must watch sasquatch huntersmust watch sasquatch hunters then you will say why did i waste my good hard earned money on such a excruciatingly bad boring movie!
the movie is just plain funmaybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of the ramones around the time the film was made ive watched the film over and over by myself and with friends and it is still fresh and funny at the risk of being too serious the concept of being a big fan of a certain band is timeless and high school students boredom with drudgery of some classes is just as timelessand the film has some gem linesscenesreferences to how our permanent record in high school will follow us through life let me assure you ive been out of high school for uhhh some years and its not following methe famous static line im getting some staticnot as much as youre going to get as principal togar approachesthe school board member who is so decrepit hes attended by nursesthe nazi hall monitors love for a body search principal togar announcing i give you the final solution and burning the ramones records note: records were what came before cds and of course joey ramone noting things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school followed by togar asking do your parents know youre ramonesjust one piece of advicedont look up where the stars are nowjoey ramone sadly died young dey young who was a major hottie in the film today reminds us we all agepj soles career never advanced as we might have expected marla rosenfield as one the other students apparently appeared only in this film one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch the film though i submit her performance was more than adequate and should have brought her more teen film roles and does anyone know what happened to dj don steele so watch and enjoydont thinkjust have fun!
what fun! bucketfuls of good humor terrific cast chemistry skeltonpowelllahrobrien dynamite dorsey-driven soundtrack! miss powells dance numbers have exceptional individual character and pizzazz her most winning film appearance
i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for $550 at walmart i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purposethen of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as im concerned i dont think this scene added to the movie at all i dont like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some 60s burn out especially!in the end although im glad to possess another hawn movie im not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it!
one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematicthere has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoeverhowever the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn! and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that
i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time im only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this classic
i have been a hindi movie buff since the age of 4 but never in my life have a watched such a moving and impacting movie especially as a hindi film in the past several years i had stopped watching contemporary hindi movies and reverted to watching the classics teesri kasam mere huzoor madhumati mother india sholay etc but this movie changed everything it is one of the best movies i have ever seen i found it not only to be moving but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first generation indian woman growing up in america it helped me to understand my own family history which was always something very abstract to me but to see it feel it and understand it helped me to sympathize with the generations before me and the struggle that indian people endured the film helped to put many things into perspective for me especially considering the current world events i never thought that a movie could change the way i think like this before it did the plot is fantastic the acting superb and the direction is flawless two thumbs up!
it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years i found this dvd drastically reduced for sale and thought it was worth a shot the opening few credits iconic to pekinpah fans has the inter-cutting between man and animal but here we have non-diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted fantastic suspense then when the perps caan and duval travel to their next mission duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her the ensuing laughter is fantastic and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalmas dressed to kill at the short-lived expense of angle dickenson the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits the film falls flat even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value a bold call for anyone who knows what im talking about i use pekinpahs credits as supplementary lecture material but once they are finished turn the killer elite off
well waynes world is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl off-shoot movies from such cinematic offal as its pat to the recent 80 minute yawn a night at the roxbury many have no doubt lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen well fear not because tim meadows comes through in spades the well-written plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the leon phelps character introduced in the five minute skit the storyline allows the character to develop the humor consisting largely of sex jokes is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder than i have in any movie in recent memory its a just great time if you dont feel like taking yourself too seriously tiffany-amber thiessen of saved by the bell fame makes an appearance in the film and looks incredible finally billy dee williams reliving his colt 45 days gives the movie a touch of class and for those out there who are mindless movie quoters like myself you will find this movie to be eminently quotable ooh its a lady!
this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully: he does not know his job! the scenes are unbalanced without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness he has nothing to say about the subject so he over-licitates with violence nakedness and gutter language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why dont they let him succumb in piece
despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced presented in digestible as digestible as war can be episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the us the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year
this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot unlike some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds ive already preordered them i suggest you do to
im usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance the only true upside to this film is cornelia sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is really shortthe plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film none of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone im not sure why on earth sean connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this onethe only reason i could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard sean connery fan and simply want to see everything hes done save this one for last thoughwell if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then i hope you enjoy it more than i did thanks for reading
mirror mirror 1990 is a flat out lame movie why did i watch movies like this when i was younger who knows maybe i was one for punishing myself by watching one terrible movie after another i dont know i guess i needed a hobby during my teen years a teenage outcast rainbow harvest seeks solace in an old mirror soon she learns about the horrific power this antique mirror has and uses it to strike out against those who have wronged her movies like these the power giver has a nasty side effect this one changes her inside and out if she likes it or nota mess of a movie that for some reason was restored on dvd a few years back i dont know why they should have left it on the shelf and collect dust people love this movie foe some reason if you do i would like to know why until then i dislike this movie and i have no reason to ever watch it againnot recommended at all
2 words: academy award nuff said this film had everything in it comedy to make me laugh drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival breakin 2: electric boogaloo the acting was tip top of any independant film jeremy earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the joan cusack show his lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young jimmy walker i thought i saw the next emergance of a young denzel washington when the line my bus!! its gone that was the true turning point of the movie my grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the dvd and recommended it to her friends it will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white tony donato and african american nathan davis bond through thick being held up at knife point and thin nathan giving tony tips on women the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer hollywood
ive always liked this john frankenheimer film good script by elmore leonard and the main reason this wasnt just another thriller is because of frankenheimer his taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star ron jeremy as a consultant! you can make a case that its the last good film roy scheider made ive always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance clarence williams iii got all the publicity with his scary performance and hes excellent also but i really thought trebor stood out frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts what can you say about a film that has ann margaret being shot up with drugs and raped a guilty pleasure to say the least vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young kelly preston makes an early appearance a classic exploitive thriller that shouldnt be forgotten
just about everything in this movie is wrong wrong wrong take mike myers for example hes reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasnt changed since his snl days over ten years ago hes doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices his cat is painfully unfunny he tries way to hard hes some weird type a comedian not the cool cat hes supposed to be the rest of the movie is just as bad the sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent theres even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr seuss story avoid this movie at all costs folks its not even an interesting train wreck i hope theyll make horton hears a who with robin williams then well have the bad-seuss movie-starring-spasitc- comedian trilogy
the plainsman represents the directorial prowess of cecil b demille at its most inaccurate and un-factual it sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than wild bill hickok gary cooper buffalo bill cody james ellison calamity jane jean arthur george armstrong custer and abraham lincoln to interact even though in reality lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place every once in a while demille floats dangerously close toward the truth but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship the film is an attempt to buttress custers last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends truly this is the world according to demille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment but a pretty campy relic by todays standardstransfer: considering the vintage of the film this is a moderately appealing transfer with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks theres a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments all in all the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract the audio is mono but nicely balancedextras: forget it its universal! bottom line: as pseudo-history painted on celluloid this western is compelling and fun just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!
hilarious evocative confusing brilliant film reminds me of bunuels lage dor or jodorowskys holy mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for what is it i laughed almost the whole way through all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre entertaining through and through from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end if it was an end i only wish i could remember every detail it haunts me sometimeshonestly though i have only the most positive recollections of this film as it doesnt seem to be available to take home and watch i suppose ill have to wait a few more years until crispin glover comes my way again with his big slide show and subsequent what is it screening i saw this film in atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash so i was slightly dazed at the time which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike glover in his appropriate burly-q setting scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent dadaist wet dreamis it a statement on life as we know it of course everyone expects art to be just that i rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space what you dont tell us is what we must deduce but is far more valid than the lies that other people feed us day in and day out rather one what is it than 5000 movies like titanic or sleepless in seattle shudder gag groanthank you mr glover additionally a fun man to watch on screen or at his big slide show-- smart funny quirky and outrageously hot make more films write more books keep the nightmare alive
this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series 7 this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark its writing is lazy absurd self-indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and buttheadit is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun -- pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo -- all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing ive ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate ive ever seen its absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basementmakes me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously
a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped the first was marlee matlins award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man daniel day-lewis in 1989 for my left foot al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled matlin who played a deaf woman is herself deaf but all the others are able-bodied this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal my view however is that the majority of these awards were well deserved i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks and that was because i preferred nigel hawthornes performance in the madness of king george in that film of course hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working-class dublin family he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body his left foot hence the title he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet life in working-class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim grey cheerless place very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle sheridan and day-lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme in the name of the father against this however must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people especially the brown family much of christys success was due to the support he received from his parents who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior and from his siblings we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially-made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back yard the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart-warming triumph over adversity movie that it does not is due to a number of factors principally the magnificent acting in the course of his career day-lewis has given a number of fine performances but this together with the recent there will be blood is his best he is never less than 100% convincing as christie; his tortured jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person even though intellectually we are well aware that day-lewis is able-bodied the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole from hugh oconor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christys mother which won her the best supporting actress award the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character christy brown had a difficult life but he could also be difficult to live with and the film gives us a warts and all portrait he was a heavy drinker given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him and the film shows us all these aspects of his character of course it also shows us the positive aspects- his courage his determination and his wicked sense of humour day-lewiss acting is not just physically convincing in that it persuades us to believe in his characters disability but also emotionally and intellectually convincing in that it brings out all these different facets of christys character his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh but it was well deserved 810
hollywoods misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits for every godfather ii there are dozens of more american graffitis stayin alives and grease 2s while the original grease is not a great film the 1977 adaptation of the long-running broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960s energetic choreography and an appealing cast when paramount began work on a follow-up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbusterfortunately for moviegoers michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts her talent and beauty were already evident herein and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform maxwell caulfield however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic what romantic interest beyond hormones could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan caulfield that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory only cameos by veterans such as eve arden connie stevens and sid caesar have any wit although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame materialreviewers have complained that because grease 2 is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking however even taken on its own terms the film is a clunker after a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy dissipates with few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960s and the only nostalgia evoked is for our miss brooks and sid caesars comedy hour the jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia birch is clumsy to be polite however worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters unfortunately grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny instead the film holds the viewers attention like a bad train wreck just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered the next scene plunges into even worse carnage
i was raised watching the original batman animated series and am an avid batman graphic novel collector with a comic book hero as iconic as batman there are certain traits that cannot be changed creative liberties are all well and good but when it completely changes the character then it is too far i purchased one of the seasons of the batman in the hopes that an extra bonus feature could shed some light on the creators reasoning for making this show such an atrocity in an interview on the making of the batman one of the artists or writers im unsure which said that we felt we shouldnt mess with batman but we could mess with the villains so they proceeded to make the joker into an immature little kid begging for attention the penguin into some anime knockoff mr freeze into a super-powered jewel thief poison ivy into a teenage hippie and countless other shameful acts which are making bob kane roll over in his grave to sum it all up: i wish i had more hands so i could give this show four thumbs down it squeezes by my rating with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the batman name warner brosrethink this! please!
one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed great storyline with a romantic horrific and ironic plot fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character! not to mention that the voice-acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series dont miss out on the best of the series
still a sucker for pyuns esthetic sense i liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a let-down as usual pyun develops a warped sense of humour and kathy longs fights are extremely impressive beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen
what a terrible film it sucked it was terrible i dont know what to say about this film but dinocrap which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sigh its not roger corman that i hate its this god-awful movie well really but what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics which is another thing the cgi sucked out loud; i hate this movie dreadfully this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b-movie and probably the gayest b-movie too its-its--- dinocrap! im sorry i must have offended some nerds in these moments its just an awful movie 01000
yesterday my spanish catalan wife and myself saw this emotional lesson in history spain is going into the direction of political confrontation again that is why this masterpiece should be shown in all spanish high schools it is a tremendous lesson in the hidden criminality of fascism the american pilot who gets involved in the spanish civil war chooses for the democratically elected republican government the criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that uribe ever made the colors are magnificent the cruelty of a war could anybody tell me the difference between any war and a civil war is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other the cowards that start their abuse of power even towards innocent children are now active again a film like el viaje de carol carols journey tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century it is a better lesson in history than any book could contain again great work from the peninsula iberica !
although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies i find this movie to be particularly grating maybe because im from a different era and a different country but i found crosbys continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first trite after a while and then finally annoying dont get me wrong - im not anti-american whatsoever - but it seemed that the english could do no right andor needed this brave oh so smart american visitor to show them the way its a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time its the fish who has the upper hand to be fair to both myself and the movie i have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each timei watched another crosby movie last night - the emperors waltz - and that too produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife - who for whats its worth is american - found the in your face attitude of american crosby to be irritating one too many references to teddy roosevelt as she put it as for the premise of the movie its unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good the scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes - although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid picture moe of the three stoogesall in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot its pretty hard to sit through this movie
its interesting how 90% of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of *random username* from united states no state pride who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies i would delve further into this suspicious trend but alas this is a review of the movie and not the reviews themselveslet me start by saying that i am both a christian and a true avid movie fan this means i have seen a great many movies from good to bad and can wholeheartedly claim that facing the giants is in fact not a good movie it has good intentions but fails to meet many if any basic standards that i associate with a quality filmgoing experiencethe acting: mostly terrible palatable at best hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise methe dialogue: clumsy cheesy the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit youd see performed in sunday school or youth group function the rave review robots revel in the absence of meaningless words but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world and the complete absence of it is palpable lets just say the mean ol head coach of a team in a state championship game would have a lot more to say than oh no! when things are not going his waythe plot: mind-bogglingly predictable it has been commented that this movie is not a hollywood cliché and yet its like it was pulled directly from making an underdog sports movie for dummies including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies and just had a christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it im not lying or bragging when i say i had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented herethe directingediting: it too was patterned almost exactly after the generic underdog sports movie template still acting aside there werent many noticeable goofs so at least facing the giants was technically competentthe message: ask jesus and he will grant all your wishes part of me hoped that this movie would end in the teams eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole if we lose we praise you part because in the real world you will fail at one point or another and its good to be prepared for that but in the world of facing the giants if you fail clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating another interesting question being what if the eagles came across another team that had gotten religion would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves or would the universe simply have exploded the bottom line: for the hardcore conservative christian parents crowd lamenting the evils of hollywood facing the giants will be another mediocre-at-best christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making for everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else and a warning: any attempt to show this to non-christians will lead not to conversion but to derision i give this two stars one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget
this move reminded my of tales from the crypt keeper it has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve i think thats always the them in a crypt story the same goes for the bad acting very bad acting i enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didnt like it and i wasnt expecting much whenever i watch a stephen king movie i dont expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels i have read the shining and carrie and they were great books i love how carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such it was so good but i noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies the endings were very different then the movie versions i assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy i ending of thinner is the worst so cheesy i want to read the book to find out the real ending i suggest everyone who intends to read stephen kings novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare and that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book i intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies im sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong
just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative though exceedingly predictable writing sean connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man blair underwood from the ultimate penalty to set things right connery ventures to the scene of the crime where he must contend not only with the passage of time but a meddling sheriff laurence fishbourne twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous but just cause is worth a look on a slow night
this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane i believe that mister bin would play it better generally speaking film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie stauffenberg from 2004 but cant get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever however movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values
van dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film as indeed must every single individual involved to be honest i am rather embarrassed to admit i watched it from start to finish production values are somewhere between the original series of crossroads and prisoner cell block h most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot as for the acting performances if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable story to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in maiden voyage worse still you cant even fast forward to the sex scenes because there arent any an appallingly dreadful film
a real classic a shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts a maidens cry for aid results in the dispatch of the rape squad a cult film waiting to happen!
ashanti is a very 70s sort of film 1979 to be precise it reminded me of the wild geese in a way richard burton richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa its a very good film too and i enjoyed it a lotdavid michael caine is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa beverley johnson who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor while theyre doctoring one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman played perfectly by peter ustinov of all people the rest of the film is david trying to get her backmichael caine is a brilliant actor of course and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff hes helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on rex harrison! then briefly by a helicopter pilot william holden and then by an arab called malik kabir bedi malik has a score to settle with suleiman he is very intense throughout a very engaging character and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camelthen theres lots of adventure theres also lots of morality-questioning the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster but its all pretty forgivable the question is will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif yes of course omar sharif is in it!
someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen-age gamin ended thirty years ago this is one of the worst films released in years an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing this thing should have been smothered at birthi hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture
this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limits of mores race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left -- sometimes very ostensibly -- unsaid its about identity memory community belonging the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer it will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all
!!!! possible mild spoiler !!!!!as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn`t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a jagged edge joe eszterhas clone from the mid 80s it starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client type film which ends in a ridiculous manner and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 angry men
*spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*when this show first started i found it tolerable and fun fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked it also had high ratings along with spongebob but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the showfirst off toilet humor isnt all that funny you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp but thats pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke next there are the kiddie jokes lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing lololol!!! i just cant stop laughing at such gay bliss! somebody help me! but of course this show wouldnt suck that bad if it werent for stereotypes did you see how the team portrayed australians they saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert but now is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all over-used jokes!!! the show constantly pulls up the same jokes the majority of them being unfunny thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! cosmo is mostly the one to blame i hated how they kept on mentioning super toilet which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well and cosmo would freak out and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode you know the one in which every single parent oblivious to other parents saying it would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kids room yes it may be first class humor to some people but it is pure s*** to othersif im not mistaken i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show thank god! everyone around my area says its like the funniest nickelodeon show ever i just cant agree with it i think its just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday only worse
great movie and the family will love it!! if kids are bored one day just pop the tape in and youll be so glad you did!!!~~~rubei luv raven-s!
this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a** off watch enjoy its funny
nolls comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary this guy should never have been given a thesaurus cut to noll and you know youre in for a treat!the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
theyre showing this on some off-network its well crap while it is not as bad as the b-movies they show on the sci-fi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where theyre wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range theyre playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time its not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
blazing saddles! its a fight between two estranged brothers dennis quaid and arliss howard both of whom can ignite fires mentally; they square off over childhood differences with dippy love-interest debra winger caught in the middle director glenn gordon caron the tv whiz-kid behind moonlighting smothers the darkly-textured comedy in vince gilligans screenplay with a presentation so slick the movie resembles an entry from an over-enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million-dollar grant it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities these arent even characters theyre plot functions barely-released to theaters the film is a disaster although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good winger is the only stand-out in a cast which looks truly perplexed *12 from ****
encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - its awful in almost every way: editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is harvey keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only

thats the sound of stan and ollie spinning in their gravesi wont bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as theyre so obvious they go without saying small things like this being the all new adventures of laurel and hardy despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made little things like that a bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called laurel and hardy as bad as that is it might have worked for a really bad idea try casting two actors to impersonate the duo okay they might claim to be nephews but the end result is the samebronson pinchot can be funny okay forget his wacky foreigner cousin larry schtick in perfect strangers and look at him in true romance here though he stinks its probably not all his fault and like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money there are those who claim americans find it difficult to master an effective english accent this cause is not helped here by pinchot what is stan welsh iranian pakistani only in stans trademark yelp does he come close though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium thats nothing to write home about gailard sartain does slightly better as ollie though its like saying whats worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers remember the originals with their split-second timing intuitive teamwork and innate loveability well thats absent altogether replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels this one has some long-winded mummy hokum and what a lousy title! thats mixed in with the boys fraternity scenario i cant claim to have seen every single one of laurel and hardys 108 movies but i think its a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of thismaybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves or at least using their own accents it at least felt natural and unforced as opposed to the contrived caricatures pinchot and sartain are given and since when did stan do malapropisms and so many at that i was gonna give you a standing cremation; i would like to marinate my friend stop it! only notable moment is a reference to bozo the clown the cartoon character who shared larry harmons l & h comic harmon of course bought the name copyright how disconcerting to see a ® after laurel and hardy and was co-director and producer of this travesty questions abound would stan and ollie do fart gags if they were alive today would they glass mummies with broken bottles have stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big cgi-finale lets hope noti did laugh once but i think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is why was this film made in the first place who did the makers think would like it possibly the worst movie ive ever seen an absolute abhorrence i grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes about as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage
judy holliday struck gold in 1950 withe george cukors film version of born yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold againit never happened in it should happen to you i cant think of a blander title by the way holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde whos maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted even jack lemmon in what i believe was his first film role cant muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy the audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch upmaybe if youre enamored of holliday youll enjoy this; otherwise i wouldnt bothergrade: c
this is one of the weakest soft porn film around i cant believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes the guy mike is a major wimp and moron i cant believe he didnt want to take a shower with his bride-to-be toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer jan he does do a threesome with toni and kristi but that was short i hate that every time in soft core porn films threesomes between a woman a man and a woman is short but a girl-girl thing is about an hour to the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film shouldve have two threesome scenes not one but two
lets face it: the final season #8 was one of the worst seasons in any show ive ever enjoyed mostly ive never found dry spells to last a whole season but if you judge this show by the last season of course its going to come across as inferior that is an entirely unfair assessment-- because that 70s show was in its day a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there werent so different than we are here in modern timesall right ignoring season 8topher grace stars as eric forman a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of donna laura prepon the feminist girl next door playing their friends danny masterson hyde mila kunis jackie wilmer valderrama fez and even ashton kutcher kelso give fantastic performances in almost every episode the best one is probably fez a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get what country is he from try to figure it out! for another dimension of entertainment debra jo rupp and kurtwood smith are phenomenal as erics parents rupp as kitty is both formidable and sweet sort of like mrs brady meets marie barone while smiths red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone don stark and tanya roberts play very well opposite each other as donnas parents the chauvinistic but likable bob and the airheaded midge tommy chong has occasional appearances as leo a stoner who acts as a father figure to hydeapart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over-the-top lessons that sometimes come and that deplorable final season 70s is a terrific show with amazing writing spot-on direction and a feel-good vibe pulsing through every episode theyre all alright
the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel ferrer was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however once the action switched to the home of ingrids fiancé it all completely fell apart instead of romance and charm we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the fiancés boorish son and the military attachés vying for the maids attention looked stupid--sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate just as in the other film i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game but elena and her men had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film
at the name of pinter every knee shall bow - especially after his nobel literature prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned by-the-numbers sixth-form anti-americanism but this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece the original sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind yes it was a theatrical confection and it is easy to see how its central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen but it still worked terrifically well this is a michael caine vanity piece but lets face it caine is no olivier not only can he not fill larrys shoes he couldnt even fill his bathroom slippers the appropriately-named caine is after all a distinctly average actor whose only real recommendation like so many british actors is their longevity in the business he was a good harry palmer excellent in get carter but thats yer lot mate! give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original this is more of a half-pinter
writerdirector john hughes covered all bases as usual with this bitter-sweet sunday afternoon family movie curly sue is a sweet precocious orphan cared for from infancy by bill the pair live off their wits as they travel the great us of a fate matches them with a very pretty yuppie lawyer and the rest is predictablekids will love this film as they can relate to the heroine played by 9 year old alisan poter who went on to be the you go girl! of pepsi commercials the character is supposed to be about 6 or 7 as she is urged to think about going to school some of her vocabulary suggests that she is every day of 9 or oldersimilar to home alone there is plenty of slap-stick and little fists punching big fat chins again this is formula film making aimed at a young audience entertaining and heartwarming dont look for any surprises but be prepared to shed a tear or two
this anime series starts out great: interesting story exciting events interesting characters beautifully rendered and executed not everything is explained right away dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode but imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thrillergiant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear youre ok its good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci-fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy
its wonderful to see that shane meadows is already exerting international influence - les convoyeurs attendant shares many themes with a room for romeo brass: the vague class identity above working but well below middle the unhinged father the abandoned urban milieu the sense of adult failure the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life but if meadows is an expert formalist mariage trades in images and his coolly composed exquisitely surreal monochrome frames serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter which meadows-like veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds there are longueurs and cliches but poelvoorde is compellingly mad an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous; while individual set-pieces - the popcornpidgeon explosions; the best marriage sequence since the dead and the deadly - manage to snatch epiphany from despair
first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english - which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however ill rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movies atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie im sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didnt see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a 1 what can i say us oriented tastes maybe
the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand and this film is no exception what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce indeed it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadnt plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have ironically become boring the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster the less people pay attentionwhich is where this adaptation of our sunshine a novel about the kelly legend excels rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore the film quickly establishes him as a human being indeed the reversal of the popular legend showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd here ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it no i am not making that up about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles while the kelly gang were distinctly irish australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly a scene with some chinese migrants highlights thisheath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australias most notorious outlaw it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesnt look completely lost without his bow and geoffrey rushs appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state but it is naomi watts appearing as julia cook who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kellys life but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here indeed a lot of the films hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative once the element of police corruption is established in fact the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushedunfortunately most of the films strengths are not capitalised upon rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits ditto for watts and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins i can only conclude that another fifteen or even thirty minutes of footage might have fixed this but that leads to the other problem in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well but unfortunately it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while if one were to believe the impression that this film creates a matter of weeks even days passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman and the infamous shootout at glenrowan annoyingly the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here simply referred to in subtitles before the credits rollthat said aside from some shaky camera-work at times ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts and it has a good beginning for that reason i rated it a seven out of ten other critics have not been so kind so if youre not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout then you might be better off looking elsewhere especially if you want a more factual account of ned kellys life
at first glance it would seem natural to compare where the sidewalk ends with laura both have noirish qualities both were directed by otto preminger and both star dana andrews and gene tierney but thats where most of the comparisons end laura dealt with posh sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed-up in a murder where the sidewalk ends is set in a completely different strata these are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties where the sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks getting caught-up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathingwhile i havent seen his entire body of work based on what i have seen dana andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat-down cop det sgt mark dixon hes the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession one night he goes too far and accidentally kills a man he does his best to cover it up but things get complicated when he falls for the dead mans wife morgan taylor tierney whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case as morgans father means the world to her dixons got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himselftechnically where the sidewalk ends is outstanding besides the terrific performance from andrews the movie features the always delightful tierney she has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter the rest of the cast is just as solid with tom tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout beyond the acting the direction sets lighting and cinematography are all top-notch overall its an amazingly well made filmif i have one complaint and admittedly its a very very minor quibble its that tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings its a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed-up with some of these unsavory characters its not really her fault its just the way tierney comes across she seems a little too beautiful polished and delicate for the part but her gentle kind trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal
the penultimate episode of star treks third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season essentially spock mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planets population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr atoz the librarian all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidons past spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the city on the edge of forever--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidons present in the end all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova the enterprise warps away just as the star explodesironically as william shatner notes in his book star trek memories this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisettes script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the shows executive producer fred freiberger that vulcans werent supposed to fall in love p272 however freiberger reasoned the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state this was a great example of improvisation on freibergers part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in platos stepchildren play music with hippies in the way to eden or sometimes display emotion the script here was more believable spocks acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner p272 the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state not just spock but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows the brilliant spockmccoy performance and the originality of this script who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planets fate by travelling into their past this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of classic trek--a genuinely inspired story shatner in memories named some of his best unusual and high quality shows of season 3 as the enterprise incident day of the dove is there in truth no beauty the tholian web and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome p273 while my personal opinion is that and the children shall lead is a very poor episode while is there in truth no beauty is problematic all our yesterdays certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films i give a 9 out of 10 for all our yesterdays
whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake wertmullers film is incomprehensiblethis new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it i hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because ive never walked out of a moviebut i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took linas movie and turned it into another blue lagoonthis is a film that you wouldnt even waste time watching late night on cinemax time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this
final score: 18 out of 10after seeing jay and silent bob strike back i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie soul survivors is a junk psychological thriller dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like dushku wes bentley american beauty casey affleck drowning mona and likable star melissa sagemiller luke wilson is also in there ridiculously miscast as a priest the movie the brainchild of writerdirector stephen carpenter seems like a mutant offspring of open your eyes or vanilla sky and movies where a character and the audience is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accidentdeath the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved i dont think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with but ss is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it the visuals the script the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this plus its pg-13 so it doesnt even deliver the gore or t&a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure even the unrated version is tame i had heard that the movie contained some hot shower scene between dushku & sagemiller as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least i would get something out of this then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off thats it people thought this was hot soul survivors is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about in the end it leaves us empty carpenters finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and thats probably the most lively part it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci-fi channel due to its low cost and pg-13 rating - and thats probably best for it
i loved this movie it was almost the same as the first cabin by the lake only instead of just killing women he kills men also and the scenes are much more interesting 2 of my favorite scenes are firstly when stanley and allison are in the dance club and he is describing kimberlys last moments before she is thrown to the water and secondly when stanley is visiting allison in his basement right before they head down to the set when she kisses him those scenes for me were very intense and riveting i gave the movie a rating of 810 not because the movie was bad but because the filming was bad i mean there were times when youd notice nothing was wrong like its being shot the way a film is usually shot you wouldnt see the live camera shooting but then very little you would notice the filming mistakes what went wrong
theo robertson has commented that waw didnt adequately cover the conditions after wwi which lead to hitlers rise and wwiiperhaps he missed the first one and a quarter hours of volume 8 covers this period and together with the earlier volumes in the series shows clearly the existing conditions i feel a friend of mine grew up in germany during this period joined the hitler youth even and his experiences were very similar to that mentioned in wawthis documentary is so far above the history channels documentaries i also own that there is no comparisonthe only fault and it is a small one that i have with waw is this: the numbers are not included many times for instance if youre talking about lend-lease then how much war material was lentleased how much to russia how much to britian how many merchant ships did the u-boats sink and when how many ships did the german or japanese navy have total in 1941 what type were they how many troops how many troops did the allies have in total and by country lots of numbers could have made a lot of viewers nod off but i would have preferred more! and naturally i always want to see more military analysis like why didnt patton & clark trap the german army that was at cassini after they had it surrounded instead of racing monty to rome and letting it escape i dont think you can begin to understand war until youve seen some of these video segments on total war like the fire bombing of dresden its like trying to understand auschwitz etc before you see the clips of the death camps: you just cant wrap your head around it - its too unbelievableunknown at that time and of course unfilmed were the most egregious cruelties and inhumanities of the japanese including cannibalism read flyboys and some live vivisection of medical experimentation prisoners wo any anesthetic! dave
this is just flat out unwatchable if theres a story in here somewhere its so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work thats its indiscernible theres a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them they pop their heads out and talk like speedy gonzales if you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod well thats what you get here these folks are loud obnoxious violent and just extremely annoying then there are some anti-human humans who stand around in their cgi spaceship being so incredibly pompous that its impossible to take these folks make hillary clinton seem like a right-wing extremist in comparison theyre friends with some vampires or somethingwho caresthen theres the camera work remember how everybody hated the thousand-cuts-a-minute crap from the recent rolleball remake the folks who made this movie love that stuff theres enough of it in here for three really crappy nu-metal videos on mtvnuff said this thing smells in comparison dracula 3000 is a masterwork
this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldnt feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watchingi dont enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torturedean morgan rochester ny
this movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites the voices for the animals are wonderful sally field and michael j fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch but the real standout is don ameche as the old faithful golden retriever this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! happy tears!
the shows echoed bubbling sound effect used to put me to sleep a very soothing show i think i might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril i had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in tarpon springs florida i would assume lloyd bridges never dove there i only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge-of-the-seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmothers house imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads i thought flipper had better undersea action of course he had the advantage of being in his natural environment
saw a screener of this before last years award season didnt really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended but whatever maybe for exposure at the least but the movie was a convoluted mess sure some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way but none of the characters felt very real to me at all there was not one person that i could connect with and i think that is where it failed for me sure the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards scientology wow! what a grand idealets see if that already hasnt been mined to the point of futility the whole ordeal feels fake from the lighting the casting the screenplay to the horrible visual effectswhich is supposed to be intentional i can tell and so can everyone else no one is laughing with you though anyways i hope it makes it out for sale on dvd at least i wouldnt want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed but its tripe either way boring tripe at that
this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen im still not sure if it was serious or just a satire one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of arrrrghdon johnson was pretty good in it actually but otherwise it sucked it was over 10 years ago that i saw it but it still hurts and wont stop lingering in my brain the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is i wont ruin it for you should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end with a few in between if you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it might be worth your while additionally if youre forced to go on a date with someone you really dont like suggest watching this movie together and theyll probably leave you alone after they see it thats a fair price to pay i guess
i give this five out of 10 all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! we have countless full-face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything taking a pee perhaps we dont see his hands on the guitar thats the point! also were given plenty shots of hendrix from behind there appears to be three cameras on hendrix but amateur fools operate all of them the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun complete waste of film! if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight
loved the movie i even liked most of the actors in it but for me ms davis very poor attempt at an accent and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms davis they would be laughed off the screeni really think she phoned this one in now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much morei guess i just dont get bette davis ive always thought of her as an actor that plays herself no matter what role shes in the possible exception is now voyagerim sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful and i hope civil detail how i am totally wrong on this but ill continue to watch the movies shes in because i like the storieswritingsupporting casts but ill always be thinking of different actresses that could have done a better job
repugnant bronson thriller unfortunately its technically good and i gave it 410 but its so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment far more disturbing than a typical slasher film
vampires sexy guys guns and some blood who could ask for more moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! gackt is the innocent sho - who befriends a vampire kei hyde their relationship grows with time but as sho ages keis immortality breaks his heart it doesnt help that they both fall in love with the same woman the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget its a touching story ripe with human emotions you will laugh cry laugh then cry some more even if you are not a fan of their music see this film it works great as a stand alone vampire movie9 out of 10
a well cast summary of a real event! well actually i wasnt there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film: communistophobia and parallels to adolf hitler these should be evident to most independent observers anyway boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other well-known actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable - and i mean it! anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal thats why its so terrible - it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place
time paradoxes are the devils snare for underemployed minds theyre fun to consider in a what if sort of way film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including star trek: first contact the back to the future trilogy bill and teds excellent adventure groundhog day and the stargate sg1 homage window of opportunity heinleins all you zombies was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first timein the case of terry gilliams excellent film 12 monkeys its hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mindsome seeing the film for the first time will regard cole played by bruce willis as a schizophrenic most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as the continual wrenching of experience visited upon him by time travelunlike other time travel stories 12 monkeys is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past cole tells his psychiatrist railly madeleine stowe that time cannot be changed but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 in his own personal time-lineeven this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe in order to ensure that the time-line is not alteredcole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised if thats the case time is like a fluid it always finds its own level or path irrespective of the external forces working on it it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too muchif you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time as we see on board the plane at the end of the film then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past eventsor does it the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematiciansbonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget which is no particular surprise after the munchausen debacle and in light of his later attempt to film don quixote i would rate the making of documentary as one of the more interesting ive seen it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved gilliams description of the film as his 7½th release on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore not really his film - doesnt do the film itself justicebrad pitts portrayal of goines is curiously engaging although his character is not especially sympathetic watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum its disturbing and distractingprobably a coincidence the louis armstrong song what a wonderful world was used at the end of both 12 monkeys and the final episode of the tv series of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones12 monkeys is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain its not a mindless recreation thats for sure
film version of sandra bernhards one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say shes scathingly honest and that may be true but shes also shrill with an unapologetic in-your-face bravado that isnt well-suited to a film in this genre she doesnt want to make nice--and shes certainly not out to make friends--and thats always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of sandras in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share *12 from ****
i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5210 for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci; concerning mr kamar dels reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of timeand im trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is 1 and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o
plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in new orleans by director elia kazan kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes a man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game it turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact city and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease a detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community regardless of outcome you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the films protagonist richard widmark as drclint reed and paul douglas as detective warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers barbera bel geddis as reeds wife has some good moments with widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of restful more than comic relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the new orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer joe mcdonald zero mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic walter jack palance as the skeletal blackie black death is simply outstanding with riveting intensity palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well in addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity especially in the films powerful final allegorical moments panic in the streets is probably kazans best non-brando film its tension filled suspensefully well paced and edited its ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with panic he succeeds with aplomb
ive read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this movieand the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies tribulation armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraisecom and judge for yourself blessings to all
the animation in this re-imagining of peter & the wolf is excellent but at 29 minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter & the snails because everything moves at a snails pace i couldnt even watch the film in one sitting - i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time and it was pure torturesave yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank mei can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short short! category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them - and must predict that theres no way this film will come close to winning
i do agree with everything calamine has said! and i dont always agree with people but what calamine has said is very true it is time for the girls to move on to better roles i would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and i would like to see them grow as people actresses and in their career as well as their personal life so producers please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the tangent a bit move them into a new direction that recognises them individually and their talents in many facets this movie that is being commented is not too bad but as i have seen further on in their movies their movies stay the same of typical plot and typography when in rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their successes and so hence i think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds maybe some that are like the sixth sense the hour chocolat that sort of movie - not saying to have just serious movies for them humour ones too yes but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and new york minute note: i am from australia so excuse my weird spelling like reognise with the s instead of z
how can this movie have a 55 this movie was a piece of skunk s**t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick that really cheap as* flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw itsecond the person who did the set sucks as* at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this tv show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s**t they call a movierating:03
white noise had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since the exorcist i think seeing as evp is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people like i said this movie could have but did not the movie degraded itself to a low class pg-13 scary movie nothing compared to the ring or the sixth sense by any means someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think but it makes us jump scream everything a horror movie should do im honestly sick of the pg-13 horror genre because its becoming a genre of its own we need the old days back the blood and gore days the freddy kruger the jason the mike myers days few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary so why try to pull it off a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at alldont waste your money on this movie
in 1948 this was my all-time favorite movie betty grables costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that douglas fairbanks jr was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women i saw it again the other day; i was surprised to find that it still did
ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever mariette hartley and g d spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon
the vampire bat is definitely of interest being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930s but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praisethe film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals there is a very similar feel to james whales frankenstein and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwills dr niemann character complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancementthe vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton herman dwight frye thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed onethis is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co-starred also doctor x and the mystery of the wax museum and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements taken in context though the vampire bat is still weak and derivativeall we are left with is a poor-quality frankenstein imitation with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the blondie films a few years later
this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders who it shows between 1969 and 1971 were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments anglo-american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the western orbit it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation and in these new circumstances beset by homesickness they suffered substantially accelerated rates of deathfollowing the passage of more than three decades however in recent months and years following the release of many utterly damning papers from britains public record office one rather suspects that there was some mistake and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state as such the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved nevertheless the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime
the story-line was rather interesting but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughtsbehavior more extreme than necessary also i think something went wrong in the casting john turtorro doesnt really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player not to speak of the italian player motives werent very much outlined either
a mess of genres but its mainly based on stephen chows genre mash-ups for its inspiration theres magic kung-fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so its easy to get past the many flaws in this filma baby is abandoned next to a basketball court a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery thats in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but cant read the old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks the new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the masters weak punches and throws him out for the night the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangsters club to play darts this leads to a big fight the boys expulsion from the monastery and the mans decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensational this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie the man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film im sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end the effects photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but thats not a good reason to ignore it its quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending recommended
my super x-girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend she was just simply fabulous!!! luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good a lot better than in the scary movie franchiseivan rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasnt for him and uma thurman this film wouldnt have done so well this film is clearly a 1010 for its cast uma thurman its director its screenplay and from its original plot line this film is very highly recommended
he only gets third billing behind arthur treacher & virginia field but this was effectively david nivens first starring role and hes charmingly silly as p g wodehouses dunderheaded bertie wooster master in name only to jeeves that most unflappable of valets as an adaptation its more like a watered-down the 39 steps than a true wodehousian outing and thats too bad since the interplay between treacher & niven isnt too far off the mark alas the b movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes next years follow-up step lively jeeves was even more off the mark with no bertie in sight and jeeves of all people! forced to play the goof
like most people i love a christmas story i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason--it is awful same locale same narrator same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking charles grodin was a poor choice to replace darrin mcgavin but i cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him the story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original the interaction with the neighbors the bumpuses is ridiculous in a christmas story ralphies obsession with the bb gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring scud farkus the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the scud farkus menacing appeal it would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew
every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and resource but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one this also happened in the 50s with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the 50s that are worth digging out panic in the streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind both are movies that arent really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resourcesi was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed like all old movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and its characters youre in for a real treat with this moviethe movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesnt start of like that it begins as this typical crime-thriller with a touch of film-noir to it but pickup on south street just isnt really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on it ensures that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watchi also really liked the characters within this movie none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses really humane it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seeneven despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more!1010
sidney young pegg moves from england to new york to work for the popular magazine sharpes in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impressionbased on toby youngs book about survival in american business this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy but it isntthis 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story we start off in the past then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how young made his mark at one of americas top magazinespegg hot fuzz is too likable for words whether its hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the english actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene here when the scripting is good but far from his own standards he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for his antics with babe 3 are unforgivable simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing but he pulls it off splendidlybridges and anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest megan fox who stole transformers reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star the fact that her character sophie myles is starring in a picture about mother teresa is as laughable as her characters antics in the pool to emphasize the point there is a dog and pegg rounds that off in true brit style comedy with a great little twistthough a british film there is an adaptation of american lifestyle for young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the american professionalism the inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film stars gives this edgeweides first picture is not perfect there are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary the physical comedy can also be overdone as a side note the bloopers on the dvd are some of the finest you will ever see which are almost half an hour longthis comedy drama has simon pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy it is worth watching
those of the instant gratification era of horror films will no doubt complain about this films pace and lack of gratuitous effects and body count the fact is the empty acre is a good a example of how independent horror films should be doneif you avoid the indie racks because you are tired of annoying teens or twenty somethings getting killed by some baddie whose back-story could have come off the back of a count chocula box the empty acre is the movie for youset in the decaying remnants of the rural american dream the empty acre is the tale of a young couple struggling with the disappearance of their six-month-old baby as the couples weak relationship falls apart a larger story plays out in the background at night a shapeless dark mass seethes from a sun baked barren acre on their farm and seemingly devours anything in its path leaving no sign that it was ever therethe film is loaded with enigmatic characters and visual clues as to what is happening and ends with a well executed ending that resonates with just enough left over questions to validate the writerdirectors faith in an intellectual audiencethere seems to be a sub-text concerning the death of the american dream but i would hardly call the film an allegory riveting well acted and technically astute the empty acre is a fantastic little indie that thinking horror fans should love
this movie ive loved since i was young! its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one cant interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our heros name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander hes shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel thats a just a little fact that is kind of amusing! anyway great movie good story itd be neat to see it redone with todays special effects! oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the tv show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated!
silly simplistic and short gun crazy volume 1: a woman from nowhere goes nowherethis brief just over sixty minutes tale isnt so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip-off of sam raimis the quick & the dead his admitted homage to the spaghetti westerns brought into a contemporary setting in quick & dead sharon stones character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff played by gene hackman who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father a brief cameo by gary sinise in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head in gun crazy saki played by the nimble ryoko yonekura seeks revenge against the dastardly mr tojo played with minimalist appeal by shingo tsurumi who when she was but an urchin placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck the only significant difference despite the settings is the fact that tojo sadistically cripples saki with well i wont spoil that for you in case you decide to watch itin short saki  a pale imitation of the clint eastwoods man with no name  rides into the town  basically theres a auto shop and a tavern alongside an american military base so i guess that suffices for a town  corrupted by tojo the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored confessing her true self as a bounty hunter saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of johnny to and john woo of course by the end of the film saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys but she rises to the occasion  on her knees in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending  and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcherdont ask where she gets the rocket launcher just watch it for yourself try not to laughthe image quality is average for the dvd release there is a grainy quality to several sequences but all in all this isnt a bad transfer the sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times but again it isnt a bad transferrather its a bad film
though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of 9 seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccios 14th century decameron story collectionset within a medieval italian towns largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in timegiven the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic churchs rulesnothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions
this movie is a half-documentaryand it is pretty interestingthis is a good moviebased on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germanythis movie isnt perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves!!!if youre interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie thats worth a look!!
i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films i have no idea why but i trusted sexo pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry maybe it was because the soundtrackwhich i listened to before i saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer facesapart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within its script with modern social behaviour maybe because its photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women; blahblahblah nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the femalemale condition full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès i talked about beforethose always work always and screaming performancesit is a well acted film in its contextand by screaming i mean literally the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones i completely disagree with serrano they shouldnt have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come throughhe made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it
elegance and class are not always the first words that come to mind when folks at least folks who might do such a thing sit around and talk about film noir yet some of the best films of the genre out of the past the killers in a lonely place night and the city manage a level of sleek sophistication that elevates them beyond a moody catch phrase and its connotations of foreboding shadows fedoras and femme-fatales where the sidewalk ends a fairly difficult to find film -- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel -- belongs in a category with these classicsfrom the moment the black cloud of opening credits pass a curtain is drawing around rogue loner detective marc dixons crumbling world and as the moments pass it inches ever closer threatening suffocation sure hes that familiar cop with a dark past but dana andrews gives dixon a bleak stare and troubled intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he seems and yeah hes been smacking around suspects for too long and the newly promoted chief karl malden in a typically robust and commanding outing is warning him for the last time yet dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now and boy didnt they had have it coming hoods dusters mugs gutter nickel-rats he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about dixons right hook the advice is for him to cool off for his own good but instead he takes matters into his own hands and what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before right away hes in deep with the cops the syndicate his own partner dixons questionable involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in like bogart in lonely place can he escape what he iswhen he has nowhere else to turn he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty the marvelous gene tierney who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelors existence into something worth coming home to the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping the group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy and all of this top-notch direction and acting isnt too slick or buffed to loosen the films emotional hold gene tierneys angelic soft-focus beauty is used to great effect she shows herself to be an actress of considerable range and her gentle kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in leave her to heaven the scenes between tierney and andrewss dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self-destruction near the end of his rope cut bruised and exhausted dixon summarizes his lot: innocent people can get into terrible jams too he says one false move and youre in over your head perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind one wrong decision or punch or most frighteningly due to factors you have no control over noir has always reflected the darkest fears brought them to the surface where the sidewalk ends does so in a realistic fashion one nit-pick of an aside: this otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldnt seem out of place on mystery science theater how very odd but noir fans -- heck any movie fans -- who havent seen this one are in for a terrific treat
i have copy of this on vhs i think they the television networks should play this every year for the next twenty years so that we dont forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again like putting some people in the directors chair where they dont belong this movie rappin is like a vaudevillian musical for those who cant sing or act this movie is as much fun as trying to teach the blind to drive a city busjohn hood peebles has just got out of prison and hes headed back to the old neighborhood in serving time for an all-to-nice crime of necessity of course john heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the wayi would recommend this if i was sentimental or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma either way this is a poorly directed scripted acted and even produced i never thought id sat that satire of ghetto life with the hood although i think the redeeming part of the story through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up forget sonny spoon mario could have won an oscar for that in comparison to this rap oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three-quarters embarrassed be sure to drink first and please watch responsibly no stars better luck next time!
frank tashlins the home front is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster the home front instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy its a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact
i was really hoping that this would be a funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype i even heard an interview with the shows creator on the bbc world today - a show that is broadcast all over the worldunfortunately this show doesnt even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are one-dimensional the acting is - well - mediocre im being nice its the classic cbc recipe - one that always failsif youre muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if youre white youd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that its only a problem when it isnt funny - as in this showcanada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldnt find any
i dont know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director it seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars angie charlie denise rosanna and jon that there wasnt enough left to really make a movie this could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene since it got an r rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not angie harmon why does sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world if they were only looking for laughs why not cast whoopi goldberg and judy tenuta instead this was so predictable i was surprised to find that the director wasnt a five year old what a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well
this is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!this film is even worse than white chicks! little man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby story is awful considering it was written by six people the idea still wouldnt be too bad though if it was original and not a rip-off of a cartoon episode it has funny moments but some of them are way over-done and some are just stupid the acting was very very bad so was the directing anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves it is racist and very offensive to midgets i mean instead of showing sympathy to them the film-makers make fun of them! it really disgusts me how they do it they see midgets being just like babies and for a character who is a midget pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family that is its lame excuse for showing something like that it just was not worth it dont watch this film it is a huge waste of time and money
the key to the 40-year-old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the 40-year-old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesnt use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiositycarell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex-daily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why andy is the way he is its the little things that make this film work when andys co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesnt just adorn his home with action figures  he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldnt even begin to focus on all of these thingsthe plot is fairly simplistic  andys co-worker pals find out hes never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman its a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenilityandys friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimisticfinally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers arent worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  trish being unaware that andy is still a virginthe 40-year-old virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short-lived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script  co-written by carell  offers plentyhowever in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the 40-year-old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film its easy to understand why we like andy we care about him hes not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché  hes a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audiencealthough this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesnt offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen the best sex comedies work this way  from risky business to american pie  and that is the major difference between something like the 40-year-old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights
### spoilers! ### what is this movie offering out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot it is sad to see denzel washingtons talents go wasted in trashes like thiswe are certainly hinted how the mexicans cannot save themselves outside forces needed possibly militaristic american ones and we know the father is a shady character he is a mexican after all unlike the wife who appreciates creasey more because he is american he killed all of them thinking she died and did she of course she wont she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan the trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the implausibly successfulas some critic pointed outtaken the nausea of such movies will take time to go it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt imdbs credulity77 for a movie like this and 70 for my own private idaho go figure! mine will be in the range of 35-40
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers yes the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie but its also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat boones religiousmoral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl! quite a change from todays standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment
in an otherwise ghastly misbegotten would-be oedipal comedyi was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight 3 days after the movie opened so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warningsthe bloom is off jon heders rose the emerging double chin isnt his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isnt working it would be another crime if this were to be eli wallachs last screen appearance diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this the very worst vehicle shes chosen in the last few weekssitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive laughed even whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the films sole three dimensional character he really is among our very best actorsin summary even jeff danielss work cant redeem this picture
wow! pretty terrible stuff the richard burtonelizabeth taylor roadshow lands in sardinia and hooks up with arty director joseph losey for this remarkably ill-conceived tennessee williams fiasco taylor plays a rich dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates very loudly her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary when scoundrel burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend taylor realizes her time is up ludicrious in the extreme --- its difficult to determine if taylor and burton are acting badly or if it was williams intention to make their characters so unappealing if thats the case then the acting is brilliant! burton mumbles his lines including the word boom several times while taylor screeches hers shes really awful so is noel coward as taylors catty confidante the witch of capri presumably boom is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard williams themes but its so misdirected by losey that had taylor and burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues any substance the film has would have been completely diluted boom does have stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of sardinia! the supporting cast features joanna shimkus the great romolo valli as taylors resourceful doctor and michael dunn as her nasty dwarf security guardboth he and his dogs do a number on burton!
the scenes are fast-paced the characters are great i love anne-marie johnsons acting i really like the ending however i was disappointed that this movie didnt delve deeper into achilless and athenas relationship it only blossomed when they kissed each other
the movie starts with a pair of campers a man and a woman presumably together hiking alone in the vast wilderness sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach he then chases the girl and slashes her throat the camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killerwe next meet our four main characters two couples one in which is on the rocks the men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date sparking the token blondes ambition to leave a week early unexpectedly the men leave the same day and their car breaks down they end up arriving in the evening when the men arrive they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy ralph doppleganger they ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest the men get lostin the next scene we realize that this isnt just another the burning clone but a ghost story! the women scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping tom well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if theyve seen her children before disappearing of course the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river this causes quite a stir and he gets up grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace daddys going hunting the little girl exclaims with bad acting it is apparent here that the dad isnt a ghost like his childrenfreaked out by something in the woods the token blonde splits running blindly into the night carrying a knife she encounters the father who explains hes starving and it will be quick this doesnt make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier maybe hes allergic! are panthers honestly even in california she ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head a thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter which turns out to be where papa resides clearly someone lives here because theres a fire and something weird is roasting over it the children appear and warn them of papa who shows up moments later they disappear as soon as he arrivesfor whatever reason our killer only goes after females he invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife we are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating the old man doesnt tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards but daydreams about it we arent given the reason for the childrens demise the men go to sleep and are left unharmed the next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives after a brief discussion they split up one is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help the one that is going back to his car breaks his leg we are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother they agree to help the woman reunite with her friendsthe following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite he was also dating or married to the blonde somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it she decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever you know where this is goingoverall the movie deserves four stars out of ten and thats being generous for all its misgivings the musical score is well done its still watchable too there are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are done well the plot is unbelievable there is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief but with the toad 6 miles away; i cant imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night i mean come on!- alan skip bannacheck
somebody owes ang lee an apology actually a lot of people do and ill start i was never interested in the ang lee film hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it i finally decided to watch it yesterday on usa network and wowspoilers for ang lees hulk and the incredible hulk was it boring! i almost didnt make it through ang lees hulk eric bana was expressionless nick nolte was horrible sam elliott was unlikeable and thats no fun hes usually a cool character in fact i honestly think they chose eric bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the ang lee hulk was meant to facially resemble bruce banner in his non-angry state when hulk fought a mutant poodle i was ready to concede hulk as the worst superhero movie everbut then something happened about 34 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and - dare i say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting m1 tanks and comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an f22 raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of san francisco this was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie and i have to say the cgi was quite good thats not to say that the hulk was totally convincing but it didnt require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies and thats quite a featof course the ending got really stupid with bruce banners father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of iron mans brief heroics to shame and overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the cgi in hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment it was certainly better than i expectedok but what about the incredible hulk guess what its boring too! it has just a few appearances by the hulk and heres the thing - the cgi in this movie is horrible maybe the hulk in ang lees version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous it had skin tone and muscle tone that didnt even look like a living creature just some sort of computer-generated texture it was really preposterous the lighting environment and facial effects didnt look 5 years newer than ang lees they looked 10 years older and there really is no excuse for that we truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever couldworse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from ang lees failure all the same mistakes are made bruce banner is practically emotionless the general is so relentlessly implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the hulk the love interest is unconvincing i have to give liv tyler credit for being more emotional than jennifer connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes tim blake nelson overacts almost as much as nick nolte even though hes only in the movie for a few minutes the hulk really doesnt do much in this movie certainly not any more than in ang lees version the incredible hulk was slightly more fast-paced but since nothing really happened anyway thats not worth much oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the hulk hes actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster this is how i can definitively say ang lees version was better: if i ever have the chance to see ang lees version again i might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely id just fast forward to the good parts but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice it is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience - at least in ang lees version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of courseit is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with ang lees hulk by making almost exactly the same movie it is to edward nortons credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film
i have to say the first i watched this film was about 6 years ago and i actually enjoyed it then i bought the dvd recently and upon a second viewing i wondered why i liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but ive no idea what jessica lange was thinkingthe plot line was good but the execution was just poor im tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didnt speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes i notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest i can see why theyd like it i know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd id say spend your money on something else like a better film
yeah its a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but its actually pretty good - and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what shes in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performancethe scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an 810 go see it
it is always satisfying when a detective wraps up a case and the criminal is brought to book in this case the climax gives me even greater pleasure to see the smug grin wiped off the face of abigail mitchell when she realises her victim has left deathbed testimony which leaves no doubt about her guilt is very satisfyingplease understand: while i admire ruth gordons performance her character really *really* irritates me she is selfish and demanding she gets her own way by putting on a simpering little girl act which is embarrassing in a woman of her age worse she has now set herself up as judge jury and executioner against her dead nieces husbandwhen columbo is getting too close she tries to unnerve him by manipulating him into making an off-the-cuff speech to an audience of high-class ladies he turns the tables perfectly by delivering a very warm and humane speech about the realities of police worknothing can distract columbo from the pursuit of justice abbys final appeal to his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect not to do his job well here is one situation you cant squirm out of ms mitchell!
despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants not on the payroll apparently a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes in a later conversation she said imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates worse imagine dressing the scarlet ohara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950s hairdo maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was missing the hoop or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or earsand be laughing in the aislesexcellent story and photography be damnedsowatching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances actual geisha or japanese dress and that was the topic of the movie! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong i thought the last samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time

not a movie but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the british invasion that followed the dynamic entrance of the beatles to the music world some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond but a lot of them did featured are: hermans hermits billy j kramer and the dakotas peter and gordon honeycombs nashville teens animals and of coursethe beatlesit is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts
my choice for greatest movie ever used to be laughtons night of the hunter which remains superb in my canon but it may have been supplanted by shower which is the most artistically daoist movie i have seen the way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water and the way that water can be made inspiration and comfort and cleansing and etc is the essence of the dao it is possible to argue that the the nofth and shower themes are similar and that lillian gish in the former represents the purest form of christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of daoism i would not in any way argue against such an interpretation both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image yet shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that i give it the nod i revere both
let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan however this film is not for me many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this films claim that dragons possibly ever existed the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility the film uses nice! cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragons life this is combined with popular-tv-show-csi-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not in many cases the argumentsclues are far-fetched in some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesnt have it bottom line: its a pretentious fantasy-csi documentary not worth watching

this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that its nothing special all the characters are pretty cool and the film is entertaining throughout plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this! jackie and wai-man chan had fantastic chemistry together and are both very funny! and i thought the main opponent looked really menacing! however the dubbing was simply terrible! the character development is above average for this sort of thing! and the main fight is simply fantastic! plus some of the bumps jackie takes in this one are harsh! there is a lot of really silly and goofy humor in this but it amused me and the ending is hilarious! plus all the characters are quite likable its pretty cheap looking but generally very well made and while it does not have the amount of fighting you would expect from a jackie chan flick it does enough to keep you watching plus one of my favorite moments in this film is when jackie dragon and wai-man chantiger are playing around with a rifle and it goes off! this is an above average jackie chan flick due to the fantastic finale and great humor however other then that its nothing great still its well worth the watch! the direction is good jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part the acting is very good! jackie chan is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable hilarious as usual does some crazy stunts had fantastic chemistry with wai-man chan kicked that ass and played this wonderful cocky character he was amazing! i just wished they would stop dubbing him! jackie rules!!!!! wai-man chan is funny as jackies best friend i really liked him he is also a very good martial artist rest of the cast do ok i guess overall well worth the watch! *** out of 5

i absolutely loved this movie! it was so good! this movie is told by the parrot paulies point of view paulie is given to the little girl marie as a present paulie helps marie learn to talk and they become best friends but when paulie tells marie to fly she falls and the bird is sent away thats when the adventure begins paulie goes through so much to find his way back to marie this movie is so sweet funny touching sad and more when i first watched this movie it made me cry the birds courage and urge to go find his marie for all that time was so touching i must say that the ending is so sweet and sad but youll have to watch it to find out how it goes at the end the janitor tries to help him after hearing his story will he find his long lost marie or not find out when you watch this sweet heart warming movie itll touch your heart rating:10
i really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance its basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project and thats also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines arent funny in the first place an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected toid recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big mommas house or norbit; people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time
flight of fury starts as general tom barnes angus macinnes organises an unofficial test flight of the x-77 a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible general barnes gives his top pilot colonel ratcher steve toussaint the job & everything goes well until the x-77 disappears even more literally than barnes wanted as ratcher flies it to northern afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the black sunday lead by peter stone vincenzo nicoli who plans to use the x-77 to fly into us airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people general barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army john sands co-writer & executive producer steven seagal to get it back & kill all the bad guys in the processthis american british & romanian co-production was directed by michael keusch & was the third film in which he directed seagal after the equally awful shadow man 2006 & attack force 2007 luckily someone decided the partnership wasnt working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaborations between the two apparently flight of fury is an almost scene-for-scene word-for-word remake of black thunder 1988 starring michael dudikoff with many of the same characters even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although i must admit i have never seen black thunder & therefore cannot compare the two flight of fury is a terrible film the poorly made & written waste of time that seagal specialises in these days its boring even though its not that slow the characters are poor its full of clichés things happen at random the plot is poor the reasoning behind events are none existent & its a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed the action scenes are lame & theres no real excitement in it the villains are boring as are the heroes & its right down there with the worst seagal has madeflight of fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which isnt even matched up that well the background can change peoples clothes change the area changes the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as its all too obvious we are watching clips from other better films spliced in hell seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this the action scenes consist of shoot-outs so badly edited its hard to tell who is who & of course seagal breaking peoples arms the whole production feels very cheap & shoddythe imdb reckons this had a budget of about $12000000 which i think is total rubbish i mean if so where did all the money go although set in afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert flight of fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods it was actually shot in romania & the romanian countryside does not make a convincing afghanistan the acting is terrible as one would expect & seagal looks dubbed againflight of fury is a terrible action film that is boring amateurish & is an almost scene-for-scene remake of another film anyway another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from seagal why do i even bother any more
this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonists character was as slimy as they come the sickroomhothouse atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately ive been to spain and realize this is not realistic! in addition the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their rolesas if they were trying to distance themselves from this messi guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killedthis film might especially appeal to you
now this is one of bigs best jack hulberts single role in 1931 split into two for the band waggon radio team askey & murdoch it boasts a great stalwart cast who ham the play up for all theyre worth especially askey of course histrionics were provided by linden travers melodramatics by herbert lomas and pragmatics by richard murdochthe group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for ghostly trains spectral porters hairy sausage rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works its very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any god britain hasnt got any nowadays!ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers youll probably be very disappointed!
either or i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie i have re-visited it many times and it always holds up a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it norman jewison a fellow canadian takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious as this one is i have often wondered at the paucity of chers acting roles whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in mask i found the comedic strokes broad at times a hair salon called cinderellabut this was the whole intent of both the writer and director nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera all extravagant gestures at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat the brooklyn scenes are magical this is a brooklyn under moonlight romanticized and dramatic just like opera all in all a very satisfying film not to everyones taste by a long shot i loved the ending everyone brought together like a greek chorus every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others the camera pulling away down the hall leaving the players talking 8 out of 10

to heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story its set in a special ward for difficult cases the main story is loretta youngs; shes on leave from a long prison stretch for murder will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husbands plea for the opposite melodrama and sentiment are dominant and theyre not the honest sort to say the least for example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babiesthere are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a warners film mostly from glenda farrell who swigs gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins that to her chagrin she finds theres now a law against selling an example of her repartee: be careful farrell: its too late to be careful aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse but dont expect her to be given a dramatic momentthe main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush even given the obvious limitations this film should have been better than it is
because cruel would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a spout of b*tchiness im going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie scratch that nearly does not belong in that sentence i cant think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way still the girl who played katherine whose name i purposefully dont include - im pretending she doesnt exist remains one of the worst actors ive ever seen only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian the story was god awful it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways pretty much every part of it was pointless - though i will admit grudgingly that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise and the ending was at least slightly humorous but this film is up there with the worst ive seen dont watch it just dont there is absolutely no value in watching it none it only takes away the enjoyment of the first
we know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the world trade center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film a sweet earnest though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy they ponder the results he mumbles some more she composes another eulogy etc etcthe dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring
i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a whats up tiger lily with this filmit has to be one of the worst french films ive seen in a long time actually along with brotherwood of the wolves 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of timeits really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor filmlou doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they dont necessarily give you talentavoid this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de dartagnan
when a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with or the point is one not easily conveyed to film or the movie missed the point which is the most frequent of these results and the easiest to happen especially when the point is one not easily defined the book morvern callar has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this and felt as if he had gotten it; but i suspect most of them could not state it in words im not sure i can myself but perhaps it comes to this or something like it: things come things go such is life but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like morvern--do no doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition but the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view and to carry over in adapting the story to film the maker of this film evidently missed the point and doesnt substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothingthis is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated the merit of the book is something i conceded grudgingly: in reading it i found it a bloody nuisance and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly the narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated morvern but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions i could reach about morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance despite morverns own self-characterization as a raver am i wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class scots girl and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past in any case despite my irritation at the author i couldnt deny that his book stuck with me; and what i couldnt get out of my head was his characters attitude her angle on the world which was almost as vivid as a goya portrait morvern is the kind of person whos always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her like flies so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesnt begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough the complex of incidents and of morverns responses to them are the substance of the book and its achievement in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book i can see thisthe morvern just described is not the morvern of the movie; or if it is most of her is kept offscreen an actress who might have been a good fit for the character had she been the right age at the right time is angharad rees from the old tv series poldark samantha morton then would seem like good casting: shes rather the same sort of actress and in one of her earlier movies jesus son she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one unfortunately as the film turned out she doesnt have the character from the book to play for one thing the book is one that if it is to be dramatized virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments her perspective her voice the story loses most of its meaning it has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty and so morverns responses whether of amusement or distaste depending on her mood are missing too and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story in short the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art tv film and chose as her typical image one of ms morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing morvern signs up for were a tour of the stations of the cross this isnt at all what the book or the morvern of the book was about for another thing the morvern of the movie isnt scottish the actress said in an interview she hadnt had time to study up the accent and she ought to be: its important that she her family and her mates are all from a single place and finally the film is missing the end of the story: morverns spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: its winter the dam has frozen the power has gone out and the pub is dark minus this and minus all of the rest whats left is a failed art film a dead film about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal or native inability ever to give in to being dead

kurosawa is a proved humanitarian this movie is totally about people living in poverty you will see nothing but angry in this movie it makes you feel bad but still worth all those whos too comfortable with materialization should spend 25 hours with this movie
i see a lot of people liked this movie to me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class from the time lindsey price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable i kept on watching to see if it was going anywherefirst we have the widowed young father cliché #1 moviestv always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children starting from from my 3 sons to 2 12 dads these movies are usually dramas and comedies are tv showscliché # 2 when a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie and will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead cliché #3 if the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of latino origin and they must be illegal apparently there are no legal latinos and illegal europeans unless if there is a ira element involvedcliché #4 the said latino must be highly educated in his native country in this case he was a profesor who made 200 per month and the said highly educated latino must now act like he hasnt brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take overcliché #5 the crime the person committed really wasnt a crime but a accident but because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kickcliché #6 one never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime but some poor little cute kid this is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parentscliché #7 name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police force sev7n and copy cat and law and order come to mind right away and the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of goldcliché #8 lets go and round up some unemployed soap stars now i like lindsey price but susan haskell imo can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on one life to live as marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth it use to get me sea sick she might be anchored on land better now but she still cannot actthe movie might have been more insightful if it wasnt filled with clichés i dont think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good but this was just bad***spoiler**** now i am not going to spoil the ending oh heck i will because i feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie it involves cliché #6 and #7 unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming the father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran who all of a sudden is very upset you would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake when she didnt now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him guess what happen to her times up she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father!! come on! you all knew that was going to happen because she is a replacement child!! that is why she did not go and live with the lindey price character this movie was a insult as far as i was concerned because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the cliché ridden one the 2 stars are for 2 of the stars the little girl who i thought was very good and lindsey price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it my advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck

i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland it all came flooding back why this hasnt had a video or dvd release yet its sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasnt been released in fact i havent seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely a role he was born to play john carpenters break from horror brought this gem that id love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes belting out most of elviss greatest hits with gusto i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from la someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesnt get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel
this is a rip-roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in streets of san francisco i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes one thing does concern me though could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk could someone please assist

you know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky in fact the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer but hes too much the european rationalist i gather to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreamsdarkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer peter weir already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock 1975 here its the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white mans court but the more he looks into things the more mysterious things get and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him and then therere those scary dreams that come and go at odd timeswell structured screenplay deepens interest throughout one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlains wife and little daughters audiences can readily identify with them and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework the normalcy begins to buckle and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide chamberlain underplays throughout especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does after all its the picking up of the mask that holds the key i believe to the riddle yet his reaction doesnt really register the revelation of course the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now thirty years later in the film the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus but the subject itself remains a telling one one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family leaving them in the historical dust the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells yet its also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave perhaps theres something about past and future to think about hereanyway this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you
if it were possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport--no the pure lifestyle--of surfing to its perfect form this documentary has done it this documentary shows the life isnt just about the waves but its more about the people the pioneers and the modern day vanguard that are pushing the envelope of big wave further than its ever beenstacy peralta--a virtual legend from my early 80s skateboarding days as a socal teen--has edited reams of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence and created what is not just a documentary but a masterpiece of the genre when his heart and soul is in the subject matter--and clearly it is here--his genius is fraught with a pure vision that doesnt glamorize hype or sentimentalize his subject he reveres surfers and the surfingbeach lifestyle but doesnt whitewash it either there is a gritty reality to the sport as wellthere is so much that could be said about this documentary about the surfers the early history of the sport and the wild big wave surfers it profiles greg noll the first big wave personality who arguably pioneered the sport; jeff carter an amazing guy who rode virtually alone for 15 years on northern californias extremely dangerous mavericks big surf; and the centerpiece of the documentary laird hamliton big wave surfings present day messiahthere is tremendous heart and warmth among all these guys--and a few girls who show up on camera--and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the ocean that comes through in every word i found the story of how hamiltons adopted father met him and how hamilton as a small 4- or 5-year old boy practically forced him to be his dad especially heartwarming and again stripped of syrupy sentimentalityif you like surfing--or even if you dont--this is a wonderful documentary that must be watched if only because youre a student of the form or someone who simply appreciates incredibly well-done works of art
first of all this is a low-budget movie so my expectations were incredibly low going into it i assume most people looking at the info for this movie just wanted a bloodfest and essentially thats all it isplot there really is none its basically saw but in china and a whole hell of a lot worse cast there is none period special effects absolutely awful in my opinion there were cutaways and the blood was often completely unbelievable because of amounts splatter color texture etci believe the purpose of this movie was supposed to be a brutal shock film now it had some great potential on a bigger budget but poor scripting poor dialogue awful acting what seemed like camcorder video shots and just plain unbelievable gore made this movie truly awfulthere are movies worth taking a chance against some reviews even b-rate movies deserve some opportunities blood trails for example was the most recent i saw against reviews that was worth it but this was simply awful i hope that people considering this movie read my comment and decide against itim all for brutality and shock but the overall unrealism and truly awful acting makes for an awful experience save your timemoney and chance something else you wont be disappointed
elisha cuthbert plays sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face povertyi was clicking through the channels and found thisi read the synopsis and suddenly saw elisha cuthberti thought okayand watched the movie i didnt realise elisha had done films beforethe girl next door and 24 elisha provides a satisfactory performance the plot is a little cheesy but the film worksits amazing how this young girl went on to become the hottest babe in hollywood!
if you havent seen the gong show tv series then you wont like this movie much at all not that knowing the series makes this a great movie i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems1 its a funny snapshot of the era it was made in the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 you get a lot of funny cameos of people youve seen on the show 3 its interesting to see chuck the host when he isnt doing his on air tv personality 4 you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv showi wont list all the bad things because theres a lot of them but heres a few of the most prominent1 the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length 2 the movies story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point 3 chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970s flatnessits a good movie to watch when you dont have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once watch 20 minutes at a time and its not so bad but even then its not so good either ;
i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script bad acting except for janine turner no fantasy stupid plot dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings if you have never seen this movie before dont even bother its not worth it at all the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner did a good job acting terrys husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her nice girl huh yeah shes a real peach not shes no day at the beach either
sydney lumet although one of the oldest active directors still got game! a few years ago he shot find me guilty a proof to everyone that vin diesel can actually act if he gets the opportunity and the right director if he had retired after this movie a true masterpiece in my eyes no one could have blamed him but hes still going strong his next movie already announced for 2009but lets stay with this movie right here the cast list is incredible their performance top notch the little nuances in their performances the real dialogue andor situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing the time structure of the movie that keeps your toes the whole time blending time-lines so seamlessly that the editing seems naturalflawless the story is heightened by that although even in a normal time structure it wouldve been at least a good movie dramathriller i can only highly recommend it the rest is up to you! :o
the lovely danish actress sonja richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding herrichter plays anna an out-of-work independent-minded somewhat neurotic and perhaps suicidal actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair-bound muted aged father named walentin the great danish actor frits helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was madespoiler alertwalentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self-imposed death sentencewriterdirectoractor eric clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son jorgen played by clausen has loving a father who has never accepted him the film sags toward the end but clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible anna can alter the course of a human life highly recommended sonja richters performance is alone worth the price of admission
that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husbands first wife who died under mysterious circumstances that sounds well and good but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin well trust me no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls peacocks weird gardeners and doors being knocked on and the music is the worst it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour boring little tale that is easily figured out by the average person apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person
the two things are are good about this film are its two unknown celebritiesfirst daphne zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projectssecond the score by then known composer christopherchris young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one staryeah i know one star more is not much but in this movies case it is a lotthe rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blahwe all know where this is goingwatch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga then turn it off
my baby sitter was a fan so i saw many of the older episodes while growing up im not a fan of scooby doo so im not sure why i left the tv on when this show premiered to my surprise i found it enjoyable to me shaggy and scooby were the only interesting characters *dodges tomatoes from fans of the others* so i like that they only focus on those two however this may cause fans of the original shows to hate it i like the voice acting especially dr phinius phibes i liked listening to him even before i knew he was jeff bennett and jim meskimen as robi sounds to me like hes really enjoying his job as an actor i also get a kick out of the techies with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play dungeons and dragons or act out scenes from star wars not called by those names in the show of course
i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at laemlees on beverly this movie got the most applause of all the films that evening considering that two music videos opened first i didnt know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing i wasnt sure i was ready for a short immediately but to my surprise i really enjoyed this i thought the main actor demon guy was really good i was so impressed with his performance that i checked out his name i was surprised to see that this was the witchblade guy hes gotten really good especially since then! either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short the girl did an okay job i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young the dad did well also there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short both for this and the short playing next mexican hat which was also nice but i enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and i actually cared about the characters the other was a very simple story the story was quite illustrative and dark! it dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep add people like me interested we wont even talk about the last film in the block which i left my only complaint is that i only wish i had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10 i also thought the end credits went a little slowly otherwise it was beautifully told directed and edited the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowadays there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor i now will think of him as the sorrows lost actor not the witchblade guy
cheezy action movie starring dolph lungren lungren is a one time military man who has retreated into a teaching job but the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have left him frustrated and he decides that hes going to hang it up things get dicey when while watching over a bunch of students in detention some robbers take over the school as a base of operation for an armored car robbery its dolph versus the baddies in a fight to the death jaw dropping throw back to the exploitation films of the late grindhouse era where bad guys dressed as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair what a stupid movie watchable in a i cant believe people made this sort of way this is an action film that was probably doomed from the get go before the low budget fake breakaway sets and poor action direction were even a twinkle in a producers eye watch how late in the film as cars drive through the school dont ask they crash into the security turret dont ask since it looks more like a prison then a high school and smash its barely constructed form apartit doesnt look like it did in earlier shots what hath the gods of bad movies wrought actually im perplexed since this was directed by sydney j furie a really good director who made films like the boys in company c has his ability failed him or was this hopeless from the get go and he didnt even bother its a turkey a watchable one but a turkey none the less
an art house mavens dream overrated overpraised overdone; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve best picture of 1951 on its own merits it was dwarfed by the competition from the start place in the sun detective story streetcar named desire abbott and costello meet the invisible man; you name it if it came out in 51 its better than this arthouse crapola the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd out of place and in the wrong movie few actors in their time were less capable at acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron my #12 worst of 51 i saw 201 movies and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners
i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years needless to say the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic but still alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial post-wwii englandthis is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case its a fabric that doesnt wear out wrinkle or even get dirty! of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thickguiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast! those brits always the stiff upper lip when under fire the film might chug along exactly like guinesss goofy invention but its a good ride all the same
the best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny there is lots of sentimentality kurt russell playing reno hightower puts in one of his best performances and robin williams playing jack dundee is sure-footed as ever the cast also includes many great supporters jacks wife is played by jack palances daughter who is lovely as is renos wife who is a great comedian i cant tell you how many times ive watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it
i tried i really did i thought that maybe if i gave joao pedro rodrigues another chance i could enjoy his movie i know that after seeing o fantasma i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor so i was like what the hell at least you didnt pay 10 dollars at the quad give it a shotsometimes its better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain i often wonder if it wouldnt be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it on other occasions i often think that the world is really flat and that if i sail away far enough i will not only get away from it all but fall clear over and that some evil lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995 still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of meis there a reason for odete id say not at all just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness one that makes alex forrest look like strawberry shortcake look not only creepy but flat-out sick to the bone she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend in shrieking hysterics because she wants a child and he believes theyre too young she later crashes a funeral of a gay man and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead mans mother and lover in the sickest of ways oh of course she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one but a good three times on his grave and theres this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes pedro which sums up some weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no gender or somethingid say shes as nuts as a can of cashews unsalted but then again sos the director and me for taking a chance on this at least the men look good other than that not much else to see here
carols journey is a pleasure to watch for so many reasons the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions director imanol urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring the screenplay of angel garcia roldan is story telling at its best which it seems if the major purpose for films after all the plot is unpredictable yet the events as they unravel are completely logical perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the spanish civil war as it affected the people it was a major event of the 20th century yet hardly any americans know of it in fact in 40 years of university teaching i averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it--and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in american education so in one way this film is a good way to begin a study of that event keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled the appreciation of this film is therefore in direct relation to the amount of ones knowledge to view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely the left elbow index considers seven aspects of film-- acting production sets character development plot dialogue film continuity and artistry--on a scale for 10 for very good 5 for average and 1 for needs help carols journey is above average on all counts excepting dialogue which is rated as average the lei average for this film is 93 raised to a 10 when equated to the imdb scale i highly recommend this film for all ages
i saw this film earlier today and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didnt feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary the part i liked best the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls i knowall in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films
they had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat in the first cruel intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel its actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f-words and the end makes absolutely no sense and doesnt explain anything the writing was just terrible another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same lines that were in the original such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others i cant remember i was not impressed at all by robins acting but amy did a great job thats about the only thing that reconciled this movie
like most people i was intrigued when i heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mobthen to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said someone should beat those two kids up the picture on the cover the chase as it were total fabrication which i guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sensei have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film its like michael moores roger & me but if roger & me was moore mocking the people of flint its completely misdirected and totally inane wow! can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited to have markets full of food what jerks! and its not so much look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasnt just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they shouldve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck thats not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottomway to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people you should be very proud how about for your next movie you make a documentary about iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say haha! no such house exists! your so stupid and loved to be lied to by the media!morgan please like me spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and its no surprise since spurlock as one hit wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of himavoid like the plague
the kids i took to this movie loved it four children ages 9 to 12 years; they would have given it 10 stars emma roberts was adorable in the title role expect to see more of this next-generation roberts in the future after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears lindsay lohan and paris hilton it was refreshing to see a girl who didnt look like she worked the streets also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan rachel leigh cook barry bostwick and monica parker with a cameo by bruce willis final takeaway: cute filmnote: i did not read the book series so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone
though i saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me stephen reas depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers
this movie is just another average action flick but it could have been so much better when the guns come out they really needed some choreography help someone like andy mcnabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie then came the final scene the show-down the one we had been waiting for but was like watching something from the a-team in the 80s they shoot wildly nothing hits and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old same old
a funny comedy from beginning to end! there are several hilarious scenes but its also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it!
this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey haun is lovely however the reason the movie is so predictable is that weve seen it all before ive havent read the book a mothers gift but i hope for britney and lynne spears sake it is completely different than this movie unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized
as usual i am making a mad dash to see the movies i havent watched yet in anticipation of the oscars i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has there is no story!! a group of guys meander around iraq one day they are here diffusing a bomb tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire no wait here they are back in bagdad there is no cohesive story at all the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures by that i mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesnt follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds what do you think is going to happen well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesnt follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways why yes! do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy why yes! there is no story here the script is juvenile and predictable! the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look artsy and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture go rent full metal jacket deerhunter or platoon dont waste time or money on this boring movie!

time for a rant eh: i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 im being a little bit generous with the 7point #1: matt damon aggravates me i was thinking what a dicky voice they got for the main character when i first heard him narrate - and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad - his performance in the departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but thats another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfullypoint #2: brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed; not once did i find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought id start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-american freedom style lyrics i couldnt help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 911 in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radio-hit teen-bop 14-year-old-girl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i cant believe no better could have been done--i refuse to had it not have been for this id rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok dont bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking ; too bad its a shame they couldnt have hired better musiciansi liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thickdark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparentok im falling asleep here so ill sum it up before i start making less sensenice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck!
the sopranos is perhaps the most mind-opening series you could possibly ever want to watch its smart its quirky its funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people cant resist watching the best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the new york crime families for most of the time you really dont know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities - these are dangerous men most of them murderers but by god if you dont love them too ive laughed at their wisecracks been torn when theyve made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal the suburban setting of new jersey is absolutely perfect for this shows subtext - people arent always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds if you havent already you most definitely should
i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays such as the ones of for example vanity fair or the other boleyn girl but with a magnificent production design european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really havefortunately the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story the excellent performances from emily blunt paul bettany and jim broadbent and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the viewand i say unexpectedly because i usually do not pay too much attention to those detailsvictorian era was in my humble opinion one of the key points in contemporary civilization and not only on the social aspect but also in the scientific artistic and cultural onesbut i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so muchi also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good but they were at least inspired by good intentionsi also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokesthe only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplayi liked the young victoria very much and i really took a very nice surprise with iti hope more period films follow the example of this movie: the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story and not as the replacement of it
in the tradition of g-men the house on 92nd street the street with no name now comes the fbi story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light while its 48 year director j edgar hoover was alive it would be showed in no other kind of lightthe book by don whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from its founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film the fbi story came out its important sometimes to remember there was an fbi before j edgar hoover headed it some of that time is covered in the film as wellbut warner brothers was not making a documentary so to give the fbi flesh and blood the fictional character of john chip hardesty was created hardesty as played by james stewart is a career fbi man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twentiesin real life the bureau was headed by william j burns of the burns private detective agency it was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the harding administration when hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in he did just that through the hardesty family which is stewart and wife vera miles we see the history of the fbi unfold in addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the fbis story itself stewart and miles are most assuredly an all american couple we follow the fbi through some of the cases stewart is involved with arresting ku klux klan members a plot to murder oil rich indians bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties their involvement with apprehending nazi sympathizers in world war ii and against communist espionage in the cold warthere is a kind of prologue portion where stewart tells a class at the fbi academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own that involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight nick adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant todayof course if the fbi story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all american still the fbi does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative onethe fbi story is not one of jimmy stewarts best films but its the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me if the whole fbi were made up jimmy stewarts id feel a lot better about it theres also a good performance by murray hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with baby face nelsonvera miles didnt just marry stewart she in fact married the fbi as the film demonstrates its dated mostly but still has a good and interesting story to tell
dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by the wild bunchs walon green jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast harvey keitel warren oates valerie perrine tony richardson directing although he was pretty much a spent force by then  but now it doesnt even turn up on tv the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption with nicholsons border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wifes relentless materialism until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business unfortunately he never really gets his hands dirty barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and sadly the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the films trailerswhile that probably wasnt too convincing considering how low-key nicholsons crisis of conscience is in the film it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point hes holding characters at gunpoint then hes somewhere else and theyre free trying to kill him one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrines character gets dumber on an exponential level the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease and one impressive car stunt in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring unfortunately ry cooders beautiful title song across the borderline says it all much more economically but if you want to know the films real crime its completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part when even he cant make an impression you know somethings really wrong all in all all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time
andy goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the way through his sublime ephemeral art indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about i bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times so it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all he is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it mr goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways and always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk
in what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution purposefully i use quotations for that word jean eustache wrote and directed the mother and the whore as a poetic damning critique of those who cant seem to get enough love if there is a message to this film- and id hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this ben-hur length feature has to offer- its that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth is it possible to have two lovers some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want what is the truth in the relationships that alexandre jean-pierre leaud has with the women around him hes a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman marie bernadette lafont slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible love-of-his-life left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street veronika françoise lebrun who perhaps reminds him of her soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures at first we think it might be all about what will happen to alexandre but were mistaken the women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inwere told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was i cant say having not been alive in the period to see it first-hand was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions but eustaches point if not entirely message is that its practically impossible to have it both ways: you cant have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with f***ing as the characters refer over and over again the mother and the whores strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk youve ever seen in a movie at the same time we see a character like alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether its about some movie he saw or something bad from his past eustache makes it so that the film itself isnt pretentious- though it could appear to be- but that its about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when theyre ultimately alone in the morning if you thought films like before sunrisesunset were talky relationship flicks you havent met this but as eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or deep or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional its never ever uninteresting or boring on the contrary for those who cant get enough of a *good* talky film its exceptional while his style doesnt call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand eustaches new-wave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on themthis is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression all three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we cant ever perceive them as faking an emotion or going at all into melodrama its almost too good in naturalisticrealism terms but for eustaches material there is no other way around it luckily leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly labrun as the whore veronika a claim she staggeringly refutes in the films climax of sorts in one unbroken shot and as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony this is probably the biggest influence on jim jarmusch who dedicated his film broken flowers to eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late parisiansad to say before i saw broken flowers i never heard of eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge not available on us dvd and on vhs so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries not a minute of that time was wasted; the mother and the whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of french relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid ive seen from the country in general its complex its sweet its cold its absorbing and its very long perhaps too long its also satisfying on the kind of level that id compare to scenes from a marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each films release
this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesnt succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull long-winded dribble they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i cant believe what a laughable movie this was and im very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing nc-17 movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens pathetic
what a long drawn-out pointless movie im sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesnt make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient schindlers list but this one was such a let-down it didnt seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all dont bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead
i only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what i saw was a total piece of crap the scenes i saw were as bad as an ed wood movie no it was a hundred times worse ed wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but thats not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the worst director everthe american cop has a german accent! the police station was a desk in a warehouse with a sign police station hanging on the wall there is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about ten feetthis cop pulls women over cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse he tells his cop partner to wait in the car then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag the cop partner thinks maybe something is not right that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women but he isnt sure if that is whats happening because - hes a moron! the dialog is totally stupid the acting is awful and the characters act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen it is totally obvious to the cops partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it and yet the partner who is there all along doesnt know what is happening! the director of this film is a total hack i stopped the movie at 30 minutes because i couldnt take it anymore it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever started to watch and i wont waste anymore time on it writing this review absolutely worthless
this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course its night and it rains and he has to do it alone yawn! or the manifestation of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow thats really original there are some nice bits though like the fistfight scene mountain views and some running gags but though reno and vincent cassel do what they can thats definitely not worth it 3 out of 10
oh i heard so much good about this movie went to see it with my best friend shes female im male now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream after the first couple of dozen take off your clothes we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom we laughed at it not with it we dozed and would have been better off staying in bed we were convinced we had spent money in vain and we had the plot was incoherent and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care a waste of money a waste of celluloid this movie doesnt even deserve one out of ten votes but thats the lowest available im not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent; i dont recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence
ive seen the thin man series -- powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and arthurs chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time to schmooze and lock lips with powell! there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks! powells character lawrence bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too gushy but i cant help myself
this movie with the alternate title martial law 3 for some reason introduced me to jeff wincott for the first time and it was a great introduction although i had never heard of him before he seemed to be an excellent fighter the action scenes in this movie are great! there are lots of them too by the way the recruit fight at the peacekeepers hq is especially good theres just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people thats really fun and for the rest of the cast: brigitte nielsen was a good choice for the villain roles like this fits her but others dont matthias hues also did a good job as always hes a great fighter and macho-like character and was a good rival for wincott in this movie
gayniggers from outer space is a short foreign film about black gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon earth being gay their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay hence when they discover women or female creatures live on earth they are at first terrified; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male populationan offensive title with a racist homophobic and sexist storyline albeit probably intended as a satire give this film some shock value however theres little substance underneath as another reviewer pointed out there are few jokes besides the characters names eg arminass; i think i laughed once at one small gay joke i think i got the point of the film quickly a satire of bad science fiction but after that i had had enough; i kept wanting the film to end already and it is a short film! not brilliant or particularly well-written
what can i say about the first film everyou cant rate this because its not supposed to be entertaining but if you have to rate it you should give it a 10 it is stunning to see moving images from the year 1895 this was one of the most important movies in history i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever!
frequently voted chinas greatest film ever by chinese critics as well as chinese film enthusiasts from the outside and frankly i dont get it at all what i saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable blandly directed and acted with a complete shrew for a protagonist wei wei dont laugh is that shrew a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband yu shi for the past several years it is post wwii and they live with the husbands teenage sister hongmei zhang in a dilapidated home with not much money the man had been wealthy when they married along comes the husbands old best friend wei li who also used to be the wifes boyfriend when they were teens she considers running away from her husband with this man while the husband pretty much remains oblivious thinking he may engage his little sister to his friend thats the set-up and it doesnt go anywhere you wouldnt expect it to ive actually seen the remake directed by blue kite director zhuangzhuang tian it runs a half hour longer and is actually kind of dull too but at least it was pretty this supposed classic is pretty intolerable
i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and innovativethis is a 10 in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not they took some risks and did a few things different i think it worked well i am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone elses interpretation
poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood glamor treatment first it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in stromboli an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress and now its europa 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentimentnor does the story do much for alexander knox in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than strombolibergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman shes never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think im going out of my mind she tells her husband a portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is goingbergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war rome but being a social worker with poor children doesnt improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worsethe films overall effect is that its not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace midway through the story as bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that shes two-timing him the story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylumingrid suffers nobly through it all over-compensating for the loss of her son but its no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildlytrivia note: if she wanted neo-realism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director anatole litvak!! it would have done more for her career than europa 51summing up: another bleak indiscretion of rossellini and bergman
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice! presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn big boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped
in stand by me vern and teddy discuss who was tougher superman or mighty mouse my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan bruce lee and jet li it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead but it is a fun one and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan in this film he comes across as a martial arts godblack mask is about a man that was created along with many other men to be supreme fighting machines their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose they are invincible in some ways now that is the premise for the film but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenesjet li is a marvel he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do and that is what makes watching him so funbesides the martial arts in the film black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star the police officer they are great together but to be honest if anyone is reading this review they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department and the answer to that is a resounding yes!!! lots and lots of gory mindless action you will love this film
i have read many comments on this site criticizing the blob for being cheesy and or campy the movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects what would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget locally produced valley forge pa christian shorts let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious that fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits for what it was meant to be this film is excellent i have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts blair witch project was one of them that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot bwp was pure excrement the blob on the other hand was well thought out well scripted and thoroughly entertaining the scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy the scene in the doctors office with the blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece bottom line is i love this movie i challenge anyone out there to take $12000000 inflated for todays dollar value and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the blob it just cant be done period! thank you for taking time to read this review
did sandra yes she must have know we would still be here for her some nine years latersee it if you havent again if you have; see her live while you can

well then thank you so much disney for destroying the fond memories i used to have of my former favorite movie i was about 5 when the original movie came out and it was one of the first movies i remember seeing so now that im 16 and feeling masochistic enough i decided to rent this movie thus i managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this sorry excuse for a movie this movie takes everything that made the original endearing and wrecks it right down to the last detailin this movie ariel and eric celebrate the birth of their daughter melody and go to show her to everyone in the oceanbroadway style! after the musical number ends within minutes the sea witch morgana shows up and threatens to kill melody if triton doesnt give up the trident thus he gives it up without even a fight eric stands there gaping though ariel figures out how to use a sword and save melody morgana escapes so ariel and eric decide that melody should never go near the sea until morgana is caughtwelluh nothing of note really happens eric is a total wuss he never really manages to do anything ariel sort of does something melody manages to screw things up plus the animation is a new low-point for disney the computer graphics wind up clashing with the backgrounds ever single opportunity for character development is wasted the songs bitelook dont waste your time im pretty sure even the little kids are going to be bored out of their skulls with this since nothing even remotely exciting ever happens they wont want to sing the songs if you manage to grab a copy of this throw it out into the ocean and hope that nobody ever finds it ever
once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film - from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing
this series had potential but i suppose the budget wouldnt allow it to see that potential an interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the 1st episode the whole series 6 episodes could have made a compelling 90 minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward the music was very annoying and did not work overall there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well one grew a bit the ending was as terrible as the rest of series the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
happy go lovely is a waste of everybodys time and talent including the audience the lightness of the old-hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable very few people watched these movies for their plots but they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not here they usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs not happy go lovely and vera-ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie and couldnt do it the scottish locale was wasted usually automatically ubiquitous droll scottish whimsy is absent the photography was pedestrian the musical numbers were pedestrian cesar romero gives his usual professional performance chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part in the type of producer role essayed frequently by walter abel and adolph menjou david niven is just fine and no one could do david niven like david niven at the end of the day if you adore niven as i do its reason enough to waste 90 minutes on happy go lovely if not skip it
wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow cher whos planning to marry a man shes comfortable with danny aiello until she falls for his headstrong angry brother nicholas cage the script is sharp with plenty of great lines the acting is wonderful the accents ive been told are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful new york has never looked so good on the screen a must-see primarily for cher and olympia dukakis--theyre both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got a beautiful funny film a must see!
may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying and she killed the wife making it look like a murder rapein her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in wisconsin and moved to minnesotalast i heard she was in a mental institution security prisonshe was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for herthe events took place in a small town in wisconsin and the murder happened in minnesotathere even was a feature story in people magazine spring of 1988 i want to say on page 39 i remember this as i was in college at the time and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital
when i first saw this movie the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act very anime i think that its a really good movie to watch ^_^ the action in this movie is a 10 not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10 ^_~ if you are gackt and hyde fans you have to see it
the arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the native american residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo the commercial killers however werent the only ones shooting bison train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches there were even buffalo killing contests buffalo bill cody killed thousands of buffalo some u s government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds the buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds the last hunt holds one of robert taylors most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept taylor as a heavy guyhis characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter who kills only for pleasure had its potential: the will to do harm to another when he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker stewart granger it is evident that these two contrasted characters with opposite ideas will clash violently very soontaylors shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts he also enjoy killing indians who steal his horses he even tries to romance a beautiful squaw debra paget who shows less than generous to his needs and comfortamong others buffalo hunters are lloyd nolan outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner; russ tamblyn as a half-breed; and constance ford as the dance-hall girl but taylor steals the show richard brooks captures in cinemascope and technicolor distant view of buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animalsthe film is a terse brutish outdoor western with something to say about old western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw itmy mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in 92 i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the stairsshe was saying something like dont let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that shed been watching the woman in blackso obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the s*** out of me ive been immune to horror films since watching this!
this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partners grandson was given it he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the cruelties spoken and unspoken; but it was accurate! i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms ambulances lcc in the right colour white and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades i couldnt fault any of this from my memories and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war-torn london was also sharply presented i re-lived 193940 and my own evacuation from london with this production! i know jack golds work of course and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail; but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half-uttered value judgements of those years it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaws acting career and of golds direction and deserves to be better known it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends
war inc - corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser john cusack to do their wet-work against rival ceos a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on i kept waiting for things to make sense theres no reason or method to the madnessits considered by cusack to be the spiritual successor to grosse point blank ie war is more or less a knock-off we again see cusack as an assassin protecting *spoiler* the person hes supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience to be fair john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease the brief fights look good the rest of the film does not its all quirky often bordering on bizarre war incs not funny enough to be a parody and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the films message might be which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens interesting but the satire just doesnt work because its not funny and at its heart the film has no heart were supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusacks shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by warjohn cusack gives a decent performance his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist there really isnt a lot of chemistry between them hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesnt make a fool of herself joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out blech ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesnt start doling out a decent performance now and again patheticits not a terrible movie but in the end you gotta ask war what is it good for absolutely nothing c-
this film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years it is one of the few films perhaps the only one that actually gave me shivers: not even pasolini´s sálo to which this film bears comparison affected me like that i saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like pasolini fassbinder and others i had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like i did i think the answer would be that i was watching a horror film but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre typically in a horror film horrible and frightening things will happen but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses deserted hotels castles churchyards morgues etc this handling of the subject in horror is i think a sort of defence mechanism a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer so from this perspective hundstage is not a horror film; it takes place in a perfectly normal society and so doesn´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film but what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre especially concerning the body and its violation the stages of fright and torture it can be put through what seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression loneliness lack and violation of intimacy and integrity: precisely the themes you would find in horror but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape it is precisely within this displacement that the power of seidl´s film resides hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday displays them in quotidian repetition rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre one important point of reference here is rainer werner fassbinder fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism domination desire questions concerning ownership sexual property and control fascism and capitalism etc seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with fassbinder; like this german ally he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films during a seminar at the gothenburg film festival this year at which seidl was a guest he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated subjugated women in hundstage but no instances of a woman fighting back liberating herself seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it an artistic statement as good as any i think thank you
excellent comedy starred by dudley moore supported by liza minnelli and good-speaking john gielgud moore is arthur a man belonging to a multimillionaire family who was near to get 750 million dollars provided that he marries to a lady susan from another multimillionaire family in principle arthur accepted the conditions but he finally refused when he met nice and poor linda marolla liza minneli arthur was just a parasite because he did not work he only enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes after several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time arthur decided not to marry susan only few minutes before their wedding the end was happy for linda and arthur although the latter knew that his life will change in the coming future this comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life
thats not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it now dont get me wrong here either im not a total philistine i didnt hate the movie because it wasnt enough like police academy 9 or whatever i enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff i swearmagnolia is poor and i am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie theres some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance furthermore my wife a self confessed tom cruise hater tells me its his career best performance by far but the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snails pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or somethingit doesnt help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well i didnt think so but i dont like most people admittedly they all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route yadda yadda yadda the soundtracks dire as well with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that i had hitherto thought unique to the music of alanis morisetteall in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat the bit with the frogs is good though
of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already raja babu is one of my most favorite characters i just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle watch movies and emulate characters etc etc i love the scene when a stone cracks in kader khans mouth while eating also where shakti kapoor narrates a corny story of raja babus affairs on a dinner table and govinda wearing dharam-veer uniform makes sentimental remarks thats my favorite scene of the film achcha pitaji to main chalta hoon scene is just chemistry between two great indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs its brilliant its a cat mouse film just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other its total entertainment if you like govinda and kader khan chemistry then its a must i think rb is 6th in my list by david dhawan deewana mastana ankheinshola or shabnam swarg coolie no 1 precedes this gem of a film 710
this movie is bad i dont just mean bad as in; oh the script was bad or; the acting in that scene was badi mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public i wont even dignify it with an explanation of the plot if i can refer to it as thati can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that i have found need to vent my spleen on a movie i mean after all no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie do they well yes apparently they doand the guilty man is writerdirector ulli lommel but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! be advised leave this crap where it belongs stuck on the shelf gathering dust
if saura hadnt done anything like this before iberia would be a milestone now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of spanish culture but he has done a lot like this before and though we can applaud the riches he has given us we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include blood wedding 1981 carmen 1983 el amore brujo 1986 sevillanas 1992 salomé 2002 and tango 1998 i would choose sauras 1995 flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document next to which iberia palesiberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of isaac manuel francisco albéniz 1860-1909 and in particular his iberia suite for piano isaac albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-spanish audience he moved to france in his early thirties and was influenced by french composers his iberia suite is an imaginative synthesis of spanish folk music with the styles of liszt dukas and dindy he traveled around performing his compositions which are a kind of beautiful standardization of spanish rhythms and melodies not as homogenized as ravels bolero but moving in that direction naturally the spanish have repossessed albéniz and in iberia the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles but the source is a tamed and diluted form of spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt spanishness of pure flamenco flamenco coming out of the region of andalusia is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane hispano-arabic and jewish cultures iberia simply is the peninsula comprising spain portugal andorra and gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted sauras flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music singing dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of spanish style the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer antonio gades and other artists in his 1995 flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers musicians and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens flats and mirrors arranged by cinematographer vittorio storaro another of the spanish filmmakers important collaborators the beginnings and endings of sequences in flamenco are often rough but atmospheric marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over sigh or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something in flamenco more than any of sauras other musical films its the rapt intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olés that is the story and creates the magic because saura has truly made magic and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional storyiberia is in a similar style to some of sauras purest musical films: no narration no dialogue only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region beginning with a pianist playing albenizs music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing in flamenco music the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music it relates to other songs in other ethnicities but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly-beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention then comes the clapping and the foot stomping and then the dancing combined with the other elements there is only one flamenco song in iberia if you love sauras flamenco youll want to see iberia but youll be a bit disappointed the style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there but iberias source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience
wow! so much fun! probably a bit much for normal american kids and really its a stretch to call this a kids film this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kidhero with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miikes work the layers of meaning and metaphor particularly the anti-war anti-revenge message of human folly is pretty damn poignant as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films only instead of over the top torture and gore he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure fn rad and one of miikes best!
running only seventy-two minutes this small overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations taking place almost entirely in various non-descript spots in southern los angeles the story itself is inconsequential but like sofia coppolas lost in translation the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter it also helps considerably that morgan freeman and paz vega are playing the characters finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star his character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in carson where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie filmout of work for a few years he is embarrassed when he sees dvds of his films in the bargain bin but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff of particular fascination to him is scarlet an embittered worker from spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency she has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already still looking like penelope cruzs amazonian sister the beautiful vega one of the few redeemable aspects of james l brooks execrable spanglish brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to scarlet she and freeman interplay very well throughout the story which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at target arbys and a full-service carwash nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounterssilberling keeps the proceedings simple but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in phedon papamichaels vibrant cinematography he lensed alexander paynes sideways and the infectious score by brazilian composer antonio pinto city of god there are fast cameos by bobby cannavale as scarlets soon-to-be-ex-husband and as themselves danny devito and rhea perlman as well as a funny bits with jonah hill knocked up as the clueless driver and jim parsons the knight in garden state as a worshipful receptionist the 2007 dvd is overstuffed with extras including a making-of documentary 15 days or less aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between silberling freeman and vega in the middle of target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the dvd
this worldwide was the cheap mans version of what the nwa under jim crockett junior and jim crockett promotions made back in the 1980s on the localized big 3 stations during the saturday morningafternoon wrestling craze when ted turner got his hands on crocketts failed version of nwa he turned it into world championship wrestling and proceeded to drop all nwa references all together nwa world wide and nwa pro wrestling were relabeled with the wcw logo and moved off the road to disneymgm studios in orlando florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for wcws nitro thunder and saturday night worldwide was officially the last wcw program under turner to air the weekend of the wcw buyout from vince mcmahon and wwf today the entire nwa world widewcw worldwide video tape archive along with the entire nwawcw video tape library in general lay in the vaults of wwe headquarters in stamfordconnecticut
trite clichéd dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies hokey music and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fanswhat saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshis work the rotoscoping and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him this is frazettain motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the periodi like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead
i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an insomniacs nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasnt a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and ellen-- i cant wait to see where she ends up! shes showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that its all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd!
as i am no fan of almost any post-desperate living john waters films i warmed to pecker after he emerged from the underground waters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works cry baby polyester hairspray that to die-hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur pecker which doesnt attempt to regurgitate early successes is a slight quiet humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold at ridiculous prices some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you couldnt imagine anyone being able to give away if it wasnt emblazoned with the waters name edward furlong is fine as pecker and waters non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject
this isnt the best romantic comedy ever made but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable its directed in an old-fashioned way and that works fine cybill shepherd as corinne isnt bad in her role as the woman who cant get over her husbands death she has a sexy maturity but i cant say much for ryan oneal as philip because he is at best nondescript he may be adequate in the role but thats not good enoughhowever i get the feeling that some of the characters particularly alex and miranda are not written with enough in-depth thought we dont know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick and the writers dont tell us much beyond what happens but that problem was salvaged because mary stuart masterson has a fresh-as-a-daisy sweetness to brighten it up and robert downey jr is so charming that he melts the screen even his smile is infectious and it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenesanyway this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way why not give it a try
the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for childrenand was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing todaywhich quiet frankly is getting a little warn out it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didnt like either but in all it was a good movie
to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart though it is a very different kind of film the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set but some things never seemed to change scottland is still run by english nobles and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them rob roy is handsomely done but not the grand epic that braveheart was there are no large-scale battles and the conflict here is more between individuals and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time rob roy is simply a film about those with honor and those who are truly evilliam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose john hurt things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community sounds fair enough doesnt it problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves one of them known as archibald cunningham is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film played wonderfully by tim roth this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother this man is disgustingly effeminate rude heartless and very dangerous with a sword he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility he rapes macgregors wife and burns him out of his home this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come along with another crony of the marquis brian cox cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignityspoilers ahead!!!!!luckily for the macgregors a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace and for most of the fight it looks like these attributes will win out just when it looks like rob roy is finished he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner the first time you see what happens you will probably be as shocked as cunningham! rob roy is beautifully filmed wonderfully acted and perfectly paced the score is quite memorable too the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange who might seem to be out of her element actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor the film is violent but there isnt too much gore it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior however the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy the film has no obvious flaws thus it gets 10 of 10 starsthe hound
its a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring - a lot of stories are not self-contained if you compare to fe coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall its one of the best movies this year for sure!annoying that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum i havent got more to say and i dont want to start analyzing the single sequenceswell i think thats it!
meaning: if this movie got pitched scripted made released promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints yeah i know springer sex violence where is hereminded me of porn movies i saw in college plot and dialogue wise shoulda just done something for the scurrilous porno market showed penetration and be done with it-- would have made more money the ultimate point of this exercise
this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry this movie will also tell you why indian movie-goers are astute buyersamitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one-time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it zanzeer saw the making of angry young man lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master-servant loyalties but then the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song dance and drama what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero amitabhs vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent to me this alone is the biggest pull in the movie the rest all is typical bollywood screen writingamitabh by now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies thanks to manmohan desai this movie had a good dose of them the shoe caper in the party the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazares considerations the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fareshashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody finicky character remember him asking ranjeet to shaaadaaaap after the poisoned cake incident his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant but prakash mehra knew the indian mindand so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie but this is a caper remember and as long as it stayed that way the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy the end is always predictable and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends wellso what is it that makes this movie a near classic amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story chuck the story the characters and the plot my marks are for amitabh alone
shame really - very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end ive seen quite a few of ira levins adaptations - rosemarys baby and the stepford wives - and liked both them but this just didnt appeal to mewhen i read the plot outline - an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success - i was excited i like thrillers michael caines a good actor sidney lumets a good director and ira levins work is generally goodi wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but all id say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the films plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first 45 minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loudthe main cast - michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth - were all brilliant in their roles though worths obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actors fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannons character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same timeanyone reading this - i dont want you to be put-off watching this because of my views - give it a chance you may like it you may not its all about opinion
after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp who thought that a franchise could be born sc ii is superior in aspect more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun while that might not be saying much compared to the first movie sleepaway camp ii is worth the rentalpros: entertaining doesnt take itself too seriously like sc i inspired killings cons: crappy acting and mullets aboundbottom line: 510
this is a cute little horror spoofcomedy featuring cassandra peterson aka elvira: mistress of the dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to its sexual references this film however is very amusing elvira is the modern-day chesty morgan and the queen of the one-liners this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal elviras haunted hills which was meant to be a take-off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on its face watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience!
i think that this movie is very neat you eithier like michael jackson or you dont but if you like him then you have to see this movie i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see
i could not agree more with the quote this is one of the best films ever made if you think vanilla sky is simply a re-make you could not be more wrong there is tremendous depth in this film: visually musically and emotionallyvisually because the film is soft and delicate at times early scenes with sofia and at other times powerful and intense times square post-climactic scenesthe music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly without the music the story is only half told nancy wilson created an emotional yet eclectic score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme although never released i was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60 if you look hard you may be able to find a copy yourself crowes other musical selections such as the beach boys josh rouse spiritualized sigur ros the monkees etcetera etcetera are also perfect fits for the film crowe has an ear for great musicmore importantly the emotional themes in this film ie love sadness regret are very powerful and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience as well as the ingenious dialogue; i admit the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time againthe best part of this film however as if it could get any better is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film you will catch something new--so watch closely and be prepared to think! sure a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch but there is always more to the story than you thinkthis is easily cameron crowes best work and altogether a work of brilliance much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone it has honestly touched my life as true art has a tendency of doing it continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is i guess to understand true art is an art itselfbottom line: vanilla sky is in a league of its own
the american humane association which is the source of the familiar disclaimer no animals were harmed the registered trademark of the aha began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james 1939 needless to say the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me i suppose one could say that at least the horse didnt die in vain since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making but i cant help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice this sure wouldnt have been the path he would have taken!
hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school i think kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop break dancing graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxy--or something to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot! even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and--as a drama--failed dismally were supposed to find this kids likable and nice i found them bland and boring the one that i really hated was ramon he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great excuse me hes defacing public property that isnt his to begin with also these great kids tap into the citys electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building uh huh so were supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and funi could forgive all that if the music was good but i cant stand hip hop the songs were--at best--mediocre and they were nonstop! theyre always playing! it got to the point that i was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers cut out the music and you haver a 30 minute movie--maybe there are a few imaginative numbers--the subway dance fight a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show if you love hip hop heres your movie but it youre looking for good drama mixed in--forget it also how did this get a pg rating theres an incredible amount of swearing in this
i last read a nancy drew book about 20 years ago so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty from what i gathered the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time for my case the 80s and early 90s with hardy boys famous five and of course carolyn keenes nancy drew amongst the more famous ones i still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations usually quite heavy for a kid to lug around and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fontswell the character has been given some updates along the way as i recall my sisters subsequent nancy drew books becoming less thick of softcover with updated and a more chic nancy illustrated on the cover i cant remember if those stories were the same as the old hardcover ones but i guess these books being ghostwritten have their fair share of updating itself for the timesin this warner brothers release of nancy drew the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times but somehow the writers andrew fleming and tiffany paulsen maintained her 50s- ish small town sensibilities thereby retaining some charm and flavour that erm folks like me would appreciate her fashion sense her prim and properness even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her well nancy drewher family background remains more or less the same living with her single parent father carson drew tate donovan who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity and to wean his daughter off sleuthing in the town of river heights mom is but a distant memory and the housemaid makes a cameo but what made nancy drew work is the casting of emma roberts in the lead role niece of her famous aunt julia she too possess that sprightly demeanour that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile her nancy drew while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way actually will grow on you and in almost what i thought could be a discarded scene from pretty woman it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactionswhile dad carson drew tries hard to bring nancy out of her sleuthing environment and to assimilate into normal teenage life trust nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner a hollywood type has been was found murdered under suspicious circumstances mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity and not before long were whisked off along with her on her big screen adventuretheres nothing too black dahlia about the crime and mystery and instead its a pretty straightforward piece for nancy to solve in between befriending corky josh flitter a chubby friend from school and pacifying jealous boyfriend ned max thieriot while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her dad the storys laced with cheesy fun and an oldie sentimentality which charms and together it becomes somewhat scooby-doo like with minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions this is seriously a genre which is labelled clearly with chick flick alerti guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans rekindle the memories of old ones and probably just probably might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny loafers
this movie was a horrible excuse fora movie first of all the casting could have been better; katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom also the plot was pathedic it was extremely cliché and predictable the ending was very disappointing and cheesy but thats all ill say about that the nail in the bag though was a scene when katelyn jordan hinson was supposed to be crying but the girl couldnt cry on command! there were no tears streaming down her face just a few unbelievable sobs she is not a dynamic actress at all she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire sp thats when the movie went from not-so-good to just plain bad it really looked like she was acting in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990s that everyones sick of--only worse!i give it an f because it was just so darn hard to sit through btw i was babysitting when i saw it however you may like it if your 9 or under ;
this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors so what went wrong i dont know and simply i dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his fathers company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twistsdevices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film
i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and believability- some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad-libbed perhaps this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasnt even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of seinfelds acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes- they are corny but if you dont take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if youre looking for a random movie and you like woody allen id definitely recommend it!
with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there arent many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasnt an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to its full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be skipped completely
a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was elated when this movie came out in 1994 i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away revolted and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese topand it is not very funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom line:1 star dont even bother
i need to be honest i watched and enjoy this show because it was gross offensive hilarious and raunchy yeah there is a lot of humor for all tastes if you are into the kind of humor that deals with making fun of people falling from skateboards for example then you will have a great time for itor if you enjoy people on extreme stunt actions going bad you will also have a great time and if you enjoy scatological humor and extreme situations oh you will enjoy the showi enjoy all three kinds of humor that dirty sànchez offers i like to have a hard laugh with the situations of the show jackass is like a walk in the park compared to this one so if you are tired of the typical american stupidity of jackass give it a try to english extreme stupidity on this show with all due respectthis is a show that has little taste or class its not recommended for those who are easily offended or grossed outnow these guys need to see a psychologist specially the paco character
oh dear lord how on earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone it reeks of cheese from start to finish but its not even good cheese its the scummiest moldiest most tasteless cheese there is and i cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually truly enjoyed it yes if you saw it with a load of drunkstoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen i watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the films expected crapness we got the crapness plenty of it but not the chuckles it doesnt even qualify as a so-bad-its-good movie its just plain bad very very bad heres why look away if youre spoilerphobic: the movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death ok i was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was but i think i grasped the this guy is a bit of a badass who you dont want to mess with message behind the ingenious scene oh and a guy witnesses it so we already have our ultra-evil bad guy and wussy but cute apparently good guy cue hero big sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish ie hero is immune to bullets everyone else falls over rather clumsily cue first plot hole how the bloody hell did sammy know where this guy was or that hed watched the murder perhaps this and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions was explained in the 2 minutes before i got into the cinema but i doubt it in fact im going to stop poking holes in the plot right here lest i turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese which we all know is good cheese so the plot a very generous word to use good guy must get to la evil guy would rather he didnt hero sam stands between the two cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane as i said no more poking at plot holes ill just leave it there passenger plane next the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie and what makes it everything it is - snakes yay! oh pause first we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have hot horny couple see if you can guess how they die dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear british guy those pesky brits eh cute kids and jo brand for all you americans thats an english comic famous for her size and unattractiveness now that weve met the cast lets watch all of them die except of course the cute kids dont expect anything original its just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious really not parts of the body use your imagination since the film-makers obviously didnt use theirsso thats most of the film wrapped up so now for the best bit the ending as expected everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face yep ice-cool sammy included but wait were not all off the plane yet! the last guy to get off is good guy but just as he does he gets bitten by a you guessed it snake of all things clearly this one had been hiding in mr jacksons hair the whole time since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier despite the 200ft constrictor the one that ate that pesky british bugger being unable to so sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop at this point i prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed u-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort but no in a kind of icing on the cake way but with stale cheese remember it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest how anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me but it did well in summing up the filmactually were not quite done yet after everyone has sucked face uncle sam with leading actress good guy with tiffany token black guy with token white girl and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia its time for good guy and hero to get it onin bali!!! nope it wasnt at all exciting the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll yes the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times thats it this is the first time ive ever posted a movie review but i felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography if you like planes snakes samuel ljackson air hostesses bad guys surfing dogs in bags or english people then please please dont see this movie it will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that youll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again go see united 93 instead that was good
this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here theres an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby carts weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film-making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all disappointmentthat said theres a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
todd rohal is a mad genius knuckleface jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads what the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration or not you just have to see for yourself the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can - youll be glad you did it is hilarious and check out todds other short films also popping up here and there from time to time: single spaced and slug 660
dont let my constructive criticism stop you from buying and watching this romy schneider classic this movie was shot in a lower budget probably against the will of ernest marishka so he had to make duefor example england is portrayed as bordering on germanyby a will of the wisp victoria and her mom are taking a vacation to germany by buggy ride alonethey arrived their too quick this probably could not be helped but the castle they rented for the movie was austrian when shes told that shes queen she goes to the royal room where the members of the court bow to her where are the british citizens out side from the castle cheering for their new queen why isbnt she showing her self up to the balcony to greet her subjects low budget!where the audience back then aware of these imperfection i wonder how the critics feltdurring the inn scene she meets prince albert but isbnt excited about it durring the meeting in the eating side of the inn your hear music from famous old american civil war songs like my old kentucky home and old black joe what civil war songs in the 1830s is romy schneider being portrayed as scarletwheres mammy is magna shnieder playing her too is adrian hoven rhett or ashley what was in marishka mindwell this add to the campits unintentionally satirizing queen victoriaa story this is the only reason you should collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction germany and england are connected
i went into deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while thats something like what this film is; i also cant help but think that its just a poor mans sleuth the classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot but certainly its the case with the execution the casting of michael caine in the central role just confirms it the film is based on a play by ira levin who previously wrote rosemarys baby and the stepford wives and focuses on sidney bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him after his latest play bombs sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught arrives on his doorstep deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success and sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe killing him and then passing deathtrap off as his own workdespite all of its clever twists and turns; deathtrap falls down on one primary element and thats the characters the film fails to provide a single likable character and its very hard to care about the story when youre not rooting for any of the players this is not helped by the acting michael caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect but nobody else does themselves proud christopher reeve is awkward in his role while dyan cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance its lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film the plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others but theres always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting director sidney lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus the central location is interesting in its own right and the cinematography fits the film well overall i have to admit that i did enjoy this film; but it could have been much much better
spoilers!from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news i wanted to see it i dont remember who it was or which local omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going nebraskan they showed a snippet from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann-margret when shes swimming in the pool glovers character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out i was hooked there was one problem though i was only 13 years old at the time and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable lets just say it was worth the wait!if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement the film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman roy scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains john glovers character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time hes sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy then theres robert trebors nice name by the way! character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme he is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models then you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason who could forget the wake-up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bearafter dealing with the initial shock of realizing what hes up against scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until glover goes after his wife! the conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up i dont know why i love this movie so much it really should creep me out but it doesnt maybe its because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try its scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like glovers running around out in la looking for trouble just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle hey sport have a nice day!this film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting plenty of cameos by real life porno stars look for ron jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at glovers place another thing i must add: how hot are the women in this film wow! travolta did right by marrying kelly preston yum! we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian and ann-margret what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty 9 of 10 starsso sayeth the houndadded feb 14 2008: rip roy scheider!
this film lacked something i couldnt put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors i just dont knowbut could it have been the screenplay just exactly who was the chef in love with he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits than of anybody or anything else he never convinced me he was in love with the princessi was disappointed in this movie but dont forget it was nominated for an oscar so judge for yourself
ok so i dont watch too many horror movies - and the reason is films like dark remains i caught this on a surprisingly feature-filled dvd and it scared me silly in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pantshowever the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised id only really seen about 10% of it the rest of the time id been watching the pizza on my coffee table - nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up againthe film-making is solid and the characters situation was really compelling the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump-button - its merely a woodland a cabin and a disused jail - and a lot of darkness most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi-million dollar production the make-up effects really looked like it was! also its obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film-making the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done i noticed on-line that this film won the la shriekfest - a really major achievement and i guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers clear talent - and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed toturn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order a pizza
theres a lot the matter with helen and none of its good shelley winters and debbie reynolds play mothers of a pair of leopold & loeb like killers who move from the mid-west to hollywood to escape their past reynolds a starstruck jean harlow wannabe opens a dance studio for children and winters is her piano player soon winters as helen begins to crack up its all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness nasty phone calls a visit from wino timothy carey the movie is devoid of any real horror nevertheless its still worthy entertainment the acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific a music score by david raskin cinematography by lucien ballard and oscar-nominated costumes contribute mightily with this a place in the sun and lolita to her credit does anyone do crazy as well as winters directed by curtis harrington a master at this type of not quite a-movie exploitation in addition to carey the oddball supporting cast includes dennis weaver agnes moorehead as a very aimee semple mcpherson like evangelist yvette vickers and micheál macliammóir the irish orson welles as hamilton starr aptly nicknamed hammy
it seems a shame that greta garbo ended her illustrious career at the age of 36 with this ridiculous mistaken-identity marital romp coming off the success of her first romantic comedy ernst lubitschs masterful ninotchka 1939 where she was ideally cast as an austere russian envoy garbo is reunited with her leading man melvyn douglas for a sitcom-level story that has her playing karin borg a plain-jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive larry blake when he becomes smitten with her once he makes clear that work is his priority karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high-living twin sister katherine to test her husbands fidelity when he is back in manhattanits surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by george cukor who led garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937s camille because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend only someone with carole lombards natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by-the-numbers script by sn behrman salka viertel and george oppenheimer mgms intent behind this comedy was to contemporize and americanize garbos image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she favored in the thirtieshowever garbo appears ill-at-ease mostly as the bogus party girl katherine and especially compared to expert farceurs like douglas and constance bennett as romantic rival griselda photographed unflatteringly by joseph ruttenberg garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the chica-choca dance sequence the story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of sonny bonos death roland young and ruth gordon in a rare appearance at this point of her career show up in comic supporting roles as douglas associates this movie is not yet on dvd and i wouldnt consider it priority for transfer as it represents a curio in garbos otherwise legendary career she was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming i can see why
warning! dont even consider watching this film in any form its not even worth downloading from the internet every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid the so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film they couldnt tell a good joke to save their lives its an insult to any human being if youre looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere elselets hope this mr unterwaldt the jr being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a slowpainful death and never makes a film againin fact its even a waste of time to write anything about this crap thats why ill stop right now and rather watch a good film
a family traveling for their daughters softball league decide to take the scenic route and end up in the middle of nowhere the father is an avid photographer and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town he decides to take another detour to take some photographsof course the side show is filled with inbred freaks who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselvesthe only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors other than that theres nothing worthwhile about the film
when i first read the plot of this drama i assumed it was going to be like sex and the city however this drama is nothing like it the stories the characters seem more real and you empathise with the situations more the concept of the drama is similar four 30 something women guide us through there friendships and relationships with problems and strife along the way katie the gp is a dark and brooding character who you find difficult to relate too and is best friends with trudi a widow trudis character is heart warming as you can relate to difficulties she is having along with the fact she is the only mother of the four jessica is the party girl very single minded and knows what she wants and how to get it she is a likable character and is closest to siobhan the newly wed who whilst loving her husband completely cant help her eyes wandering to her work colleague over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the bbc continue to produce the series it could do well it is unlike other female cast dramas such as sex and the city or desperate housewives this if played right could be the next cold feet plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too
go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthys sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read andys musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artists works and is used expertly in this respect
i dont really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film its an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level its completely amateur - constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clichéd the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i dont want to be too harsh: ive made my share of student films and they were all awful but theres no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see itsafe assumption that - much like the cast - positive comments are filmmakers friends and family
tiempo de valientes fits snugly into the buddy action movie genre but transcends its roots thanks to excellent casting tremendous rapport between its leads and outstanding photography diego peretti stars as dr silverstein a shrink assigned to ride shotgun with detective diaz luis luque whos been assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods who seem to have been involved in am arms smuggling conspiracy diaz has been suspended from duty but hes the best man for the job and must have professional psychiatric help in order to be reinstated silverstein and diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving argentinas intelligence community and some uranium and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own peretti and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer though peretti isnt as classically handsome as hill remarkably even at almost two hours in length tiempo de valientes doesnt wear out its welcome and indeed writer-director damian szifron sets up a potential sequel in the films charming coda all in all a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that neither panders to the lowest common denominator nor insults your intelligence
this is a really fun movie one of those you can sit and mindlessly watch as the plot gets more and more twisted; more and more funny sally field teri hatcher in her hey-day kevin klein elisabeth shue robert downey jrits all these well-known quality actors acting as if they are soap opera starsproducers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought how on earth did they come up with this idea you will love this movie i have seen it multiple times; and each time i watch it the more i appreciate the humor the more i realize just how well-acted it really is dont expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain not some artsy attempt at finding mans inner man etc sit back relax and laugh

gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake storyits too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash pakistanthe movies aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and its government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws wont workand all the songs and music of the movie are all badmost likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguidedthe movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give 0 out of 10 i would but the lowest is 1please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster
in the film brokedown palace directed by jonathan kaplan two best friends alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to hawaii but hear that bangkok thailand is much more fun they switched plans and decided to go to thailand without telling their parents the change of plans while they were in thailand alice and darlene met a really handsome guy named nick parks daniel lapaine he tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to hong kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in hong kong they accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs they were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison i think kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever also a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made sometimes life is not fair that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have madethis movie has a great setting; it was filmed mostly in bangkok thailand this film also has great music; a few of my favorite songs are silence by delerium damaged by plumb deliver me by sarah bightman and partys just begun by nelly furtado i went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film these girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly a mistake that anyone could make therefore this film is good for any audience it makes no difference young or old -- we all are human and subject to mistakes even though i did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of --who really smuggled the drugs -- i would definitely give this film two thumbs up
i think the majority of the people seem not the get the right idea about the movie at least thats my opinion i am not sure its a movie about drug abuse; rather its a movie about the way of thinking of those genius brothers drugs are side effects something marginal again its not a commercial movie that you see every day and if the author wanted that he definitely failed as most people think its one of the many drug related movies i however think something else is the case as in many movies portraying different cultures audience usually fully understands movies portraying their own culture ie something theyve grown up with and are quite familiar with this movie is to show what those genius people very often think and what problems they face the reason why they act like this is because they are bored out of their minds : they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept those things as if they are launching space shuttles on daily basis they start a fairly hard job and excel in no time they feel like- i went to work did nothing still did twice as better as the guys around me when they were all over their projects what should i do now with my free time and whats even more boring when you can start predicting behavior not because youre psychologist but instead because you have seen this pattern in the past so for them from one side its a non challenging job which is also fairly boring sometimes and from another they start to figure out peoples behavior its a recipe for big big boredom and the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state they guy earlier who mentioned that their biggest problem is that they are trying to figure out life in terms of logic math describes logic while life is not really a logical thing is actually absolutely right
wow saw this last night and im still reeling from how good it was every character felt so real although most of them petty selfish a**holes and the bizarre story - middle aged widow starts shagging her daughters feckless boyfriend - felt utterly convincing top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the norths daniel craig the latter coming across as the next david thewlisand director roger michell this is as far from notting hill as its possible to be thank godwatch this movie!!!
the plot is tight the acting is flawless the directing script scenery casting are all well done i watch this movie frequently though i dont know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much
first saw this half a lifetime ago on a black-and-white tv in a small samoan village and thought it was hilarious now having seen it for the second time so much later i dont find it hilarious i dont find anything hilarious anymore but this is a witty and light-hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and i thoroughly enjoyed itits 1945 and fred macmurray is a 4f whos dying to get into one of the armed forces he rubs a lamp in the scrapyard hes managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes ho hum right but though the introduction is no more than okay the fantasies are pretty lively macmurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army poof and he is marching along with washingtons soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting uso where june haver and joan leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are and lavender wigs washington sends macmurray to spy on the enemy -- red-coating german-speaking hessians not brits the hessians are jammed into a bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the vaterland where the white wine is winier and the rhine waters rhinier and the bratwurst is mellower and the yellow hair is yellower and the frauleins are jucier and the goose steps are goosier something like that the characterizations are fabulous as good as sig rumanns best otto preminger is the suspicious and sinister hessian general you know heidelberg vee are 241 to 1 against you -- but vee are not afraid i cant go on too long with these fantasies but theyre all quite funny and so are the lyrics when he wishes he were in the navy macmurray winds up with columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera dont you know that sailing west meant a terrifically expensive investment and who do you suppose provides the means but isabella queen of queens when they sight the new world someone remarks that it looks great i dont care what it looks like mutters columbus but that place is going to be called columbuslandanyway everything is finally straightened out though the genie by this time is quite drunk and macmurray winds up in the marine corps with the right girlive made it sound too cute maybe but it is cute the kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story the adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story who are the hessians unless they happen to be college graduates in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say wow! awesome!
this is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990s versions but is still not all that good it feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other bbc 1980s period pieces such as mansfield park and northanger abbeythe length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90s versions and st john rivers is at least covered although not very well timothy dalton is very good as rochester but the actress playing jane is much too old there is definitely scope for a tv adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it
the broadway musical a chorus line is arguably the best musical in theatre its about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience and the sacrifices they make each dancer is auditioning for parts in a broadway chorus line yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite the film version though captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance whatsoever the biggest mistake was made in giving the directors job to sir richard attenborough whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for gandhi why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted placewhich brings us to the next problem a chorus line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes its the least flashy of broadway musicals and its simplicity was its glory however that doesnt translate well to film and no one really thought that it would for that reason the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers and should have left the theatre and audition process the singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet jazz or tap class heck they could have danced down broadway in their lively imaginations yet not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as attenboroughs complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical directionmany scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director michael douglas whether he wants to hear them or not douglas character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear and to whom he has no patience while the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play some heretical changes were made the very beautiful hello twelve hello thirteen hello love--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful surprise a song so bad that it was nominated for an oscar adding insult to injury surprise simply retold the same story as hello love but without the wit or pathosthere is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what not to do when transferring a broadway show to film if you want to see a film version of this show the next closest thing is bob fosses brilliant all that jazz while fosses daughter is in a chorus line he is the fosse who should have been involved as director he would have known what to do with this material which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort
the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much the language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days!! so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd!!!
the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way im going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning im sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor mans blade runnerthe movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities it makes the movie leave a pointless and non-lasting impressionalso the weird look of the movie doesnt help much the movie is halve cgihalve real life but its not done halve as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and 300 they even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice also considering that the character animation isnt too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasnt cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isnt a positive thing to saysome of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as; im going to do this but its none of your concern why i want to do it than just dont say anything at all mr horus! its irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you dont care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its scriptthe actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i cant say anything negative about themthe story and movie is far from original it rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic mostly modern science-fiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on mea failed and uninteresting movie experiment310
this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin amiss weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as requiem for a dream or anything penned by irvine walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucinationboringly directed by william marsh in over-saturated hues a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking and thats it except for the ludicrous sub-plot soon-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the worlds elite figures be it political or pampered within the first reel you know exactly where this is goingwhat is a talented actor like paul bettany doing in this tiresome badly written bore made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer connelly one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now hed have immediately changed agents! avoid
like all the taviani brothers films this one looks great but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a story in actuality this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film
although i am generally a proponent of the well-made film i do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not i do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema but it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual pointpasolinis work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography this is true of decameron pasolini often preferred to use non-actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under pasolinis direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors this is also true of decameron pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience such elements can often be used with startling effect but in pasolinis hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film this is also true of decameroni have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire pasolinis films even so i have never actually met any of them and i have never been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me judging him from his works alone i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker i find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious and this too is true of decameron it is also sadly true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure
the pioneering technicolor cinematography winner of special technical achievement oscar is indeed enchanting add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer and youve got a rather pleasant pictureunfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired still there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one 1936 and very few since then that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in robin hood 1938 jesse james 1939 and gone with the wind 1939 will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here the garden of allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography
if theres one genre that ive never been a fan of its the biopic always misleading filled with false information over-dramatized scenes and trickery all around biopics are almost never done right even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese the aviator and ron howard a beautiful mind they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didnt have the chops for the part i never doubted mol could handle the part since but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950s pin-up girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and tastefully done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story directorco-writer marry harron and guinevere turners fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully come oscar time mol turner and harron should be receiving nominations doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them 910
maybe its the dubbing or maybe its the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but i found europa 51 to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films ive ever seen the film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom ingrid bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son sandro franchina whilst mummy and daddy bland alexander knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy spurred on by communist newspaper editor andrea ettore giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her 1948 role as joan of arc and rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect unfortunately the script pounds its point home with ham-fisted subtlety as andrea and mom take turns declaiming marxist and christian platitudes by the final tear soaked scene i had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters a real step down for rossellini as he stepped away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950s flowers of st francis
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! i saw it at the toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoeversteer clear
zu:the warriors from magic mountain was and is an impressive classic! you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 tsui harks use of special effects was very creative and inventive he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre legend of zu is connected to zuwarriors from magic mountain! it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one the plot is a bit hard to follow but to be honest it doesnt matter it is all about the action and adventure! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi now we knowhe made this movie maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that there is so much happening on the screenyou simply wont believe! i think it is a big shame that this movie wasnt shown in theaters here in holland because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like superman returns or xmen 3 the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor! in most of tsui harkss movies he combines dramafantasymartial arts and humor somehow it is missing in this movie again i am not going to be picky about these small matters legend of zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see a true classic!
i wouldnt bring a child under 8 to see this with puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to cruellas scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child the live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kidsi dont know what the disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level the puppies are cute but this movie is spotty at best
after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick he was a brave man the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket and always remember to beware of the doughnut of death! keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of disbelief - sit back and relax - and prepare to die earth scum! you just have to see it for yourself
the wicker man i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this moviethe plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame nicolas cageshame on you! i assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent it was noti felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if its complete-the movie was just outlandish and sillyat the end youre left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance its that badi heard it compared to : glitter american werewolf in paris and gigli my boyfriend was so mad he wouldnt even talk about itgrrrr!
after watching two of his silent shorts elena and her men 1956 is my first feature-length film from french director jean renoir and i quite enjoyed it however i didnt watch the film for renoir but for star ingrid bergman who  at age 41  still radiated unsurpassed beauty elegance and charm throughout the early 1950s following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini bergman temporarily fell out of public favour her next five films directed by her husband were unsuccessful in the united states and i suspect that renoirs latest release did little to enhance bergmans popularity with english-speaking audiences {however she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same years anastasia 1956} she stars as elena sokorowska a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere before promptly abandoning them while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan jean marais she finds herself falling into a love that she wont be able to walk away from this vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy as long as you dont take it too seriously; its purely lighthearted romantic flufffilmed in vibrant technicolor elena and her men looks terrific as well a flurry of bright colours characters and costumes bergmans polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed not in an unlikable way but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup détat knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a guardian angel perhaps the films only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt mel ferrer then audrey hepburns husband who ignores everybody elses selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love and love alone this renoir proudly suggests is what the true french do best elena and her men also attempts with moderate success to expose the superficiality of upper-class french liaisons through the clumsy philandering of eugène jacques jouanneau who cant make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them for these sequences renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just isnt there
i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released many reviewers out there arent old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen salems lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini-series directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubricks stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didnt happensure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments its all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here i dont care that many reviewers here think hes all that in this clinker the heres johnny! bit notwithstandinghes just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter scatman crothers character dick halloran was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that ismany left kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters and often metaphysically kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately dont really care what happens to whomthis movie still stinks and why so many think its a horror masterpiece is beyond me
a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty depth and character it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date thank goodness they didnt give it to ralph fiennes who would have murdered it similarly emily watson shows the wealth of her experience from her outstanding background on the stage to reach the tortured chess master turturro her character has to display intelligence as well as a womans love watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring in a chance meeting between natalia watson and luzhin she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that we realize later in the film has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations later as their love affair develops she subtly likens dancing to chess luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner; she encourages him to lead her with bold brilliant moves and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best and also realize himself as her lover this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment emotionally and intellectually or so we are led to believe - certainly within the time frame natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother the italian sets are stunning the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit and most deservedly so chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting

scoop is also the name of a late-thirties evelyn waugh novel and woody allens new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity it hasnt the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of allens penultimate effort match point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but scoop does closely resemble allens last outing in its focus on english aristocrats posh london flats murder and detection this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called sid waterman stage moniker the great splendini who counters some snobs probing with i used to be of the hebrew persuasion but as i got older i converted to narcissism following a revelation in the midst of splendinis standard dematerializing act with scarlett johansson as sondra pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalists post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story on the edge of the styx joe strombel ian mcshane has just met the shade of one lord lymans sons secretary who says she was poisoned and shes told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman hugh jackman was the tarot card murderer a london serial killer sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths with sids deadpan wit and sondras bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracywoody isnt pawing his young heroine muse -- as in match point johansson again -- as in the past this time moreover scarletts not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star shes morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed sid and sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief they simply team up more or less politely to carry out strombels wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondras dad sondra whos captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool re-christens herself jade spence mr spence ie woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that hes in oil and precious metals just as jade has told him to saythats about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome at first allens decision to make johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision but johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her the film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters: sid and sondra spar in a friendly way and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though its artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniacwhat palls a bit is allens again drooling over english wealth and class things his brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing his parents were english but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia x-mans wolverine really pass as an aristocrat only in the movies perhaps here and in kate and leopoldthis isnt as strong a film as match point but to say its a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong it has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a tv show but woodys jokes are far funnier and more original than youll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness it doesnt matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when its diverting summer entertainment on a hot day you dont want a heavy meal the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without vince vaughan or owen wilson critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded match point dont believe them he doesnt try too hard why should he he may be 70 but verbally hes still light on his feet and his body moves pretty fast too
the decoy is one of those independent productions made by obvious newcomers but it doesnt have all the usual flaws that sink most such films it has a definite story it has adequate acting the photography is very good the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men and the background music isnt overdone this is a dvd new release so people will be looking here to see if its worthwhile i dont know where all the 10s come from as theres no way this film is that good --- even if youre the filmmakers mother the last film we saw at a theater was warners trashing of j k rawlings much-loved and excellent book order of the phoenix in comparing the decoy with phoenix consider that phoenix as made by warners had no story certainly no acting was allowed by the director the photography was dreadful and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess i rated phoenix a 1 because the scale doesnt go any lower the decoy is 4 times better -- in all regardsif you have the opportunity give the decoy a chance remember this isnt decoy 3 -- the shootout or any such nonsense its original if your expectations arent overblown by the foolish 10 scores here you might just enjoy the film on its own terms
i had watched snippets from this as a kid but while i purchased blue undergrounds set immediately due to its being a limited edition only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule - and thats mainly because bakshis american pop 1981 just turned up on late-night italian tv see my review of that film below! anyway i found the film to be a quite good sword-and-sorcery animated epic with especially impressive-looking backdrops the rather awkward rotoscoped characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score the plot again wasnt exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous ice-lord nekron and the enigmatic warrior darkwolf; the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when bakshi and frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed her bra could be torn off any second and half-naked to boot her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass! still its clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving darkwolf being particularly savage; the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains lair inside a cave in the long run apart from the afore-mentioned frazetta backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian 1982 and the beastmaster 1982 but also animated tv series such as blackstar 1981-82 and he-man and the masters of the universe 1983-85as for the accompanying the making of fire and ice tv mark bakshi 1982 **12:vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself! it goes into some detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live-action performances in a studio of segments from the script - which would then be traced blended in with the backgrounds and filmed still having watched several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the art of animation on the disney tins and the looney tunes sets for instance its doesnt make for a very compelling piece
since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along theres been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry dont believe it the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass running out of time 2 is a perfect example ekin cheng is the name draw here but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin he flips the coin over and over and again and again why who knows sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy but once again: who knows why theres a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera nothing makes any sense there is no action there is no sex there is no comedy all there is is a name: ekin cheng and you know what who cares
i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya ive enjoyed it every single time this is belushis pinnacle movie in my opinion belushi and lovitz are so likable and identifiable with the common man that you cant help but get involved once you start watching the movie has a wonderful cast of stars some already were big and others were just getting started its billed as a feel good movie and thats exactly what it is this movie teaches you that life isnt always so bad after all sometimes youve just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have when youre done watching youll appreciate the things you have a lot more and youll also be smiling you cant ask for much more from a movie in my opinion not to mention its a hilarious movie and youll never lose interest very very underrated movie here folksrating from me: 10 i am out!!!
a prison cellfour prisoners-carrerea young company director accused of fraud35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation daisya 20 year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and lassallea 60 year-old intellectual who murdered his wifebehind a stone slab in the cellmysteriously pulled loosethey discovered a book:the diary of a former prisonerdanverswho occupied the cell at the beginning of the centurythe diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escapemalefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films i have seen this yearthe film has a grimyshadowy feel influenced by the works of hp lovecraftwhich makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmospherethere is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developedits a shame that eric valette made truly horrible remake of one missed call after his stunning debut9 out of 10
jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain he happens upon down-on-his-luck trickster eric tsang who immediately sees cash potential in the youngsters skills basketball is the chosen avenue for riches and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of beforeits all a bit shaolin soccer i guess but not so quirky or ridiculous - the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set-up youve seen it all before but its the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when its done well luckily it really is done well here some might say surprisingly with chu yen-ping in the directors chair i expect he had good assistants - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout but such is his style and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect eric tsang compensates with a larger-than-life character that hes played many times before in real life for instance who gets many of the films most emotional momentssince the film revolves around basketball its good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing the cast show some real skill including chou and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyper-real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining assuming you like that sort of thing and justify the movies plotexistencetheres only one significant fight scene in the movie but its a doozy in the one against many style jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves and is quite impressive - hes clearly pretty strong and fast for real and ching siu-tungs choreography makes him look like a real martial artist i wish thered been more but at least its a lengthy fightvery much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended viewing!
this is one powerful film the first time i saw it the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd used the english subtitles when i needed them and really got into this movie discovering just how good it is it is excellentthe widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart an involving tale of good versus evil here its liam neeson good vs tim roth evil both do their jobs wellfew actors come across as despicable as roth man you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant irritating puss he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone elses here neeson is a mans man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this
actually this is a lie shrek 3-d was actually the first 3d animated movie i bought it on dvd about 3 years ago didnt bugs life also do that i think it was at disneyworld in that tree so im saying before they go and use that as there logo also shrek 3d was a motion simulator at universal studios they should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for dvd the movie was cute at least the little flyes were i liked iq i agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out-and-back adventure i recommend it to families and kids
the secret of kells may be the most exquisite film i have seen since the triplets of belleville although stylistically very different kells shares with triplets and the jaw-dropping opening 2d sequence of kung fu panda incredible art direction production design backgroundlayout and a richness in color that is a feast for ones senses kells is so lavish -- almost gothic in its layout somewhat reminiscent of klimt wonderfully flat in general overall perspective ornate in its celtic & illuminated design yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing -- and it all works together beautifully you fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them you are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil & brush what tomm nora ross paul and all at cartoon saloon & their extended crews have achieved with this small budgetvery small crewed film is absolutely astounding the groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal this film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire congratulations to kells on its many accolades its annie nomination as well as its current oscar qualifying run they are all very well-deserved nods indeed
there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was 80 minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this onethere are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the charactersdont spend the time on this one
essentially a story of man versus nature this film has beautiful cinematography the lush jungles of ceylon and the presence of elizabeth taylor but the film really never gets going newlwed taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantations foreman played by dana andrews the plantation is under the spell of owner peter finchs late father whose ghost casts a pall over elephant walk that becomes a major point of contention between taylor and finch the elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way the beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture taylor and andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with finch
if youre a fan of film noir and think they dont make em like they used to here is your answer -they just dont make em in hollywood anymore we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a well-made film from that genre can be read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques audiard featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from emmanuelle devos and vincent casselthe basic plot could have been written in the 40s: dumb but appealing ex-con and a smart but dowdy femme fatale who turns out to be ruthlessly ambitious discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex lovehate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money all action takes place in depressing seedy andor poorly lit locations audiard has fashioned some modern twists of course the femme fatale is an underappreciated office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who marginalize her and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake - this is old school film noir its as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films ive seen all year

having just seen the a perfect spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff ones hat - a pure masterpiece which compared to the other le carré minis about smiley has quite different qualitiesin the minis about smiley it is alex guiness as smiley who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him one can sayhere it is ensemble and story thats important as the lead actor played excellently by peter egan in the final episodes isnt charismatic at all egan just plays a guy called magnus pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small the only one who seems to understand his inner self is alex his czech handlernever have the machinery behind a spy andor traitor been told better! after having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor his ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into a perfect spy as his czech handler calls him and by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once youve veered off it he trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his mi5 spy masters everyones happy as long as the flow of faked information continues! magnuss father played wonderfully by ray mcanally is a no-good con-man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money in later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again but by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth at first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dadhis czech handler alex expertly played by rüdiger weigang creates with the help of magnus a network of non-existing informants which supplies the british mi5 with fake information for years and years just as the british did with the german spies that were active in the uk before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to das vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by mi5 menthe young lads who play magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired pym played by egan but you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifferenceindeed well worth the money!
i really liked this film all three starsconneryfishburne and underwood give credible performances;and harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it 7 of 10
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s this show quack pack shouldnt even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales its about a teen-aged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg theres no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales
with all the excessive violence in this film it couldve been nc-17 but the gore couldve been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum not even close i know hoods and am part hood they dont draw in class they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didnt last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it wouldve been nc-17 two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i wouldve liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also dont bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isnt the original scarecrow actually kept me interested
the national gallery of art showed the long-thought lost original uncut version of this film on july 10 2005 it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goody-goody individual in the original censored release of 1933 is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
in all the comments praising or damning daltons performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an 8
the van trotta movie rosenstrasse is the best movie i have seen in years i am actually not really interested in films with historical background but with this she won my interest for that time!!the only annoying thing about the movie have been the scenes in new york and the impression i had of trying to be as american as possible which i think has absolutely failedthe scenes in the back really got to my heart the german actress katja riemann completely deserved her award she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen in future i will watch more of her movies great luck for me that i am a native german speaking = and only for a year in the us so as soon as i am back ill buy some riemann dvdsso to all out there who have not seen this movie yet: watch it!!! i think it would be too long to describe what it is all about yet especially all the flash backs and switches of times are hard to explain but simply watcxh it you will be zesty!!!!!!!
even for the cocaine laced 1980s this is a pathetic i dont understand why someone would want to waste celluloid time effort money and audience brain cells to make such drivel if your going to make a comedy make it funny if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself if youre going to release it as a joke like this: dont!!! i mean it was a joke right someone please tell me this was a joke please
being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies as i have mixed feelings of them as wellwhile watching the lion king 1½ i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so devout about the lion king that i will nitpick at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself embracing the latterthe lion king 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters! my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon & pumbaa taking care of young simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameosi could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone bowed to baby simba at the beginning of lion king 1 i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i dont think many kids are really concerned about disneys profit margin on direct-to-video movieshowever i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie im just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract meas for the music it wasnt too bad but dont expect any classics to come from this movie at least lk2 had the nice ballad love will find a way as for the voicework it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie sabella did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie kavner best known as marge simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual safari on disc 2 of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of fun!!so all in all the lion king 1½ isnt a perfect movie but its cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny friends perspectivesmy imdb rating: 710 my yahoo! grade: b good
this movie was way too slow and predictablei wish i could say more but i cantif you enjoy actionadventure filmsthis is not one to seeid suggest you go see movies like;behind enemy lines with owen wilson and iron eagle with louis gossett jr
wimpy stuffed shirt armand louque blandly played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies armand falls for the lovely claire duval fetching blonde dorothy stone who uses the meek sap to get armands colleague clifford grayson the hopelessly wooden robert noland to marry her furious over being used and spurned by claire armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge sound exciting well it sure aint for starters victor halperins static nondirection lets the meandering and uneventful talk-ridden story plod along at an excruciatingly slow pace worse yet halperin crucially fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the hideously tedious proceedings the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesnt help matters any; only george cleveland as the hearty general duval and e alyn warren as the irascible dr trevissant manage to enliven things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy histrionics the drippy stock film library score the painfully obvious stagebound sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well in fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited starkly staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the brain-numbing boredom a dismally dull dud
i just came back from el otro playing here in buenos aires and i have to say i was very disappointed the film is very slow moving dont get me wrong i enjoy slow moving films! slow to the point of driving you crazy all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film this is a poorly made film but more importantly it is a film without a lick of inspiration i felt nothing for the story or its charactersel otro was made only for the sake of making a film making it forgetful i would advise you to pass on this one if you want to see good argentinian films look for films by sorin
bettie page was a icon of the repressed 1950s when she represented the sexual freedom that was still a decade away but high in the hopes and dreams of many teenagers and young adults gretchen mol does a superb job of portraying the scandalous bettie who was a small town girl with acting ambitions and a great body her acting career went nowhere but her body brought her to the peak of fame in an admittedly fringe field photogrsphed in black and white with color interludes when she gets out of the world of exploitation in new york this made-for-tv hbo film has good production values and a very believable supporting cast the problem is its emotionally rather flat its difficult to form an attachment to the character since bettie is portrayed as someone quite shallow and naive given the business she was in the self-serving government investigations are given a lot of screen time which slows down the film towards the end but its definitely worth watching for the history of the time and to see the heavy-handed government repression that was a characteristic of the fifties 710
tenchu aka hitokiri- directed by hideo gosha - starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs together with goyokin hara kiri & rebellion to the best chambara movies existingits the story about shintaro katsu who plays okada izo working for nakadei who wants to become the daymio okada being the cleaner for nakadei is being treated like a dog - and after quite a while he realises - what he realy is to nakadeibut there is so much more in this movie - every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!!tenchu means heavens punishment
this is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this onethis is quite a depressing film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demisegwen verndon showed that she could still dance too bad the movie didnt concentrate more on that maureen stapleton looking haggard still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust ballroom so much more down to earth from 10 years earlieri only hope that this film doesnt encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to thinkwhy did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsenseif the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat why did steve guttenberg jump ship as well after all he had found his lady-love this would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay theresadly with the exception of wilford brimley at this writing vernon gilford stapleton ameche tandy cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well
my wife and i are semi amused by howie mandels show i also like shatner - even when hes at his most patheticbut this is absolutely the worst show on televisionplease cancel this show it sucks a**the only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no dealthe questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure and watching shatner or the contestant say show me the money makes me want to vomitthis one will not last
robin williams gave a fine performance in the night listener as did the other cast members however the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a must see i think the problem happens because there isnt a strong enough relationship established between the caller and the gabriel nooni had to spell it this way because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to no one character the movie runs a little over 01:30 and within the first 15 minutes or so it seems noon begins his search for pete logande the boy callerthis happens after he talks to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times the conversations arent too in-depth mostly consisting of how are you im in the hospitalwhy did you boyfriend move out etc in the book the kid almost becomes noons shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a hoaxin the movie noon becomes obsessed with finding logande but the audience is left to wonder why since there really isnt a strong enough bond established between noon and the caller why bother who cares if the caller doesnt exist i know theres a difference between a book and a movie but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie since it doesnt the movie falls apartthis is surprising because of maupins other work tales of the city when it was made into a mini-series it worked beautifully
this overrated short-lived series a measly two seasons is about as experimental and unique as a truck driver going to a strip bar i am not quite sure what they mean by ground-breaking and original when they fawn all over lynch and his silly little tv opus what exactly is their criteria of what is original sure compared to the bill cosby show or hill street blues its original definitely next to law & order tp spews originality left and rightfans of tp often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers werent smart enough open enough for the shows supposed weirdness its alleged wild ingenuity or whatever as a fan of weirdness myself i have to correct that misconception there is nothing too off-the-wall about tp; it is a merely watchable rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles spinning webs in every corner but or because of it ultimately going nowhere the supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters dont behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an idiotic way half the time theres a differencewhenever i watch the weird dream sequence in living in oblivion in which the dwarf criticizes the director buscemi for succumbing to the tired old lets-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene cliché i think of lynch you want weird eraserhead is weird - in fact its beyond weird its basically abstract you want a unique tv show watch the prisoner you want a strange-looking cast felinis and leones films offer that tp looks like an overly coiffed tv crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models the cast gives tp a plastic look kens & barbies en massein fact one of the producers of tp said that lynch was looking for unique faces for the series unique faces like lara flynn boyles sheryll fenns like those effeminate-faced hunks straight out of mens catalogs or gay magazines dont get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast especially with beauties like fenn the way madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier but then dont go around saying youre making a weird show with weird-looking people and i have never understood lynchs misguided fascination with kyle maclachlan i should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right he is not unlikable but lacks charisma seeming a little too bland and polished his characters laughable eccentricities were not at all interesting merely one of lynchs many attempts to force the weirdness trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge but that time everything lynch made post-elephant man was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies what followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on lynchs relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that dont hold any water on closer scrutiny in other words lynch is every intellectual-wannabes darling so laura palmer was killed by her dad he was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense thats the best this great mind could come up with youve got b-movie horror films that end with more originality lynch is neither bright nor hard-working enough to come up with a terrific storygo to http:rateyourmusiccom~fedor8 and check out my tv & cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism list
the quote i used for my summary occurs about halfway through the good earth as a captain of a chinese revolutionary army played by philip ahn apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot more of the looters among them as his unit has just been called back to the front lines of course the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film the former kitchen slave girl o-lan for whose portrayal luise rainer now 99-years-old won her second consecutive best actress oscarthe next scene finds o-lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband farmer wang lung paul muni setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a mans upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral declinefor a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery false accusations misogyny starvation home invasion eating family pets mental retardation infanticide exploited refugees riots civil war summary mass street executions bigamy child-beating adultery incest and insect plagues of biblical proportions the good earth is a surprisingly heart-warming moviemy parting thought is in the form of another classic quote from o-lan herself while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband wang lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut: meat is meat
in my humble opinion this version of the great bdwy musical has only two things going for it - tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script ok vanessa williams is good to watchbut to me thats all there is most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - chynna phillips has no idea who kim really is and no wonder people walk over harry mcafee when its played by george wendt who looks like hed rather be back on a bar stool in boston jason alexander is passable but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone as i mentioned its good to have a version of the stage script now but i hope the young out there who have never seen a musical dont judge them all by this
as if the storyline wasnt depressing enough this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher weird stuff then theres the core premise of the heroheroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a hes besot-ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl is this person a psycho a masochist just a doomed queen who takes things too far and what sort of traumatic childhood did he have just that he didnt get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly he tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did but its really really so hard to empathize such sad and unusual self destruction was it supposed to be funny what was it all about really
being a fan of silent films i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time i was pretty disappointed as has been mentioned the film seems to be one long long commercial for the maxwell automobile perhaps if the chase scene was about half the length that it is i may have enjoyed the film more but it got old very fast and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films without lessening a viewers enjoyment what was with the mexican bandits i mean they are chasing a car through the mountains a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour yet they cant catch up to it
first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or worse slightly ridiculouslifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving sexy thoroughly engrossing tale of love disaster and possible redemption while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existencethe core story is of mathieu 18 a solitary introverted boy who meets cédric brasher more outgoing but just as lonely while on holiday with his family as the summer warms on they fall in love and when the holidays end decide to live together a year later the relationship ends in catastrophe: cédric cheats on mathieu who distraught tries to take his own life he survives and in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met this time cloaked in the chill of winterif the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied all of it happens non-sequentiallythe intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective fortunately the three time-lines used the summer of love the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seasideboth main actors put in excellent performances though whilst its a delight to see stéphane rideau cédric used to his full capacity im more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morels rather limp dramas jérémie elkaim mathieu has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness then his almost incredulous passion then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever couldthe themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning the films title presque rien almost nothing points to all of these and indeed to one of the key scenes in the film: in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him non enfin oui une fois mais ce nétait rien no well yes once but it was nothing cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt none of which we see and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever because something that seemed nothing to him a meaningless affair is everything to mathieuwhilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest it is not without hope: we get to see cédrics slow painful attempts to get back in touch with life first through a cat he adopts then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre who may be his next love but here the story ends: a teenage passion over within the year another perhaps beginning so what was it almost nothing certainly not when youre living it
a town called hell aka a town called bastard a britishspanish co-production was made on the heels of clint eastwoods success in the italian made man with no name trilogy the template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable american actors whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices this film is no exception except for the fact that they used some british actors as wellits difficult to summarize the plot but here goes the story opens with rebels or whatever led by robert shaw and marin landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside including the priest fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the shaw character is masquerading as a priest the mayor of the town telly savalas is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gunthrow into the mix a grieving widow alvira stella stevens who is searching for her husbands killer add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for god knows why after the mayor is murdered by his henchman la bomba al lettieri the town is invaded by a federale colonel landau in search of a rebel leader im sorry but the name escapes me the colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leadereven though they opened the film side by side its difficult to tell from the dialog that the landau and shaw characters know each other a blind man fernando rey claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face he does so andim sure the principals regretted making this film its just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded 1 rating shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy even landau cant salvage this film the beautiful ms stevens is totally wasted here too having just made peckinpahs the ballad of cable hogue the previous year i found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie savalas made several of these pictures pancho villa and horror express come to mind during he pre-kojak periodmichael craig is also in it somewhere as a character called pacofernando rey appeared in many of these westerns although he would emerge to play the villain in the two french connection films al lettieri would also emerge with a role in the godfather 1972 and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975in all fairness the version i watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on imdb however i cant see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much differenceavoid this one
the plot is plausible but banal ie beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her but what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic their attorney and local police who say they can do nothing at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror they have no private security staff only a fancy security system that they mishandle household or grounds staff chauffeurs etc not even apparently the funds to hire private round-the-clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero a tycoon behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner the production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors oliva hussey and don murray what were they thinking and shame on lifetime tv for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering
this movie is complete crap! avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent i pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70s sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty i like being shocked but i need a coherent story however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang i mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly please i know the cover is interesting what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a womans bare assbut dont waste your time or money as you wont get either back
superb i had initially thought that given amrita pritams communist leanings and dr dwivedis nationalist leanings film will be more frank than novel but when i read the novel i was surprised to find that it was reversekudos to marita pritam for not being pseudo-sec and to dr dwivedi to be objective this movie touches a sensitive topic in a sensitive way casualty of any war are women as some poet said and this movie personifies it it is also a sad commentary on hindu psyche as they cant stand up against kidnappers of their girls or the hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his tormentor on the other hand it also shows economic angles behind partition or in fact why girls were kidnapped in the first place i think kidnappers thought that by kidnapping girls they will become legal owners of the houses and thus new govt will not be able to ask them to return the houses this apart one has to salute the courage of characters of puro and her bhabhi they are two simple village girls unmindful of outside world and risk everytihng by trying to come back after being dishonored because there are many documented cases when such women were not accepted by their families in indiano wonder that it required a woman to understand the pains of other women
you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldnt afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils cleeses quick-tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two
im not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan an advice columnist who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brothers girlfriend its a story thats been told before but not like this there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be the cast is wonderful and even if carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower whos suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film worth a look see
eric rohmers the lady and the duke is based on the journals of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution but its a stilted affair with its strange painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone most notably this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and little of the chaos poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted but spoilt aristocratic classes the result is frequently dull and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; its a disappointing film from an acclaimed director
spoilers in first paragraph this movies anti-german sentiment seems painfully dated now but its a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda it was made back when cecil b demille was still a great director ignore all his later best picture academy awards; he never made a very good sound film this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickfords other films and really it was demilles movie not pickfords the vilification of the germans can be compared to the way the patriot of 2000 did the same to the british the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of austreheim they even had pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a german submarine so whatll get the americans more stirred up to war the sinking of the lusitania or watching americas favorite canadian import sinking in it all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another barely escaping death hypothermia depravity rape execution and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in jurassic park were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors if i was any more gullible to such propaganda i would punish myself for having a part-german ancestry was it a good film aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking theyre untouchable  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained youll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously one-sided but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before potemkins false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movies potential for propaganda it made me wonder: what became of cecil b demille somewhere between the advent of sound and the greatest show on earth he seemed to lose his ambition ben hur looked expensive but not ambitious in a sentence this movie is for 1 film historians 2 silent film buffs 3 mary pickford fans or 4 demille fans if such a person exists
i once thought that the stoned age was the worst film ever made i was wrong hobgoblins surpassed it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldnt in the stoned age i hated the characters in hobgoblins i hated the actors and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity i wont include a teaser to this film im not that cruel i couldnt subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment in fact any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning words i would use to describe this film are as follows: insipid asinine and ingenuousin conclusion please dont watch this film i beg of you from one movie lover to another no from one human being to another please for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it destroy any copies you come across
sure it may not be a classic but its one full of classic lines one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later maybe it was on cinemax one too many times! michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie--he cant seem to figure out how to play it-- but hes surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof looking for a movie to cheer you up this is it but rent it with friends--itll make it even better
fly me to the moon has to be the worst animated film ive seen in a long time thats saying something since i have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now the story is to be generoustrite the voice acting is atrocious too cute sounding the humor is of the romper room variety the animation is passable for a nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable televisionit gets a 2 only because of its ok 3-d visuals some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but weve seen much better in the past i also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes while that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time it seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creatorsi will say this though it had a pretty cool soundtrack and for the record my son wasnt too crazy about it either bad movie
i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe and robert rodriguez i assumed that upon seeing rrs name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if hes going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right wrong wrong wrong by far the worst editing since manos hands of fate the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they owed somebody but they are way to good for this besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didnt even talk so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but dont say you werent warned
well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen they have tried out these 666 child of satan the anti christ kinda movies about 1000 times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them they think that its going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood this movie doesnt have any idea in it actors and filming is just terrible cant even make out that 10 line minium of this movie really nothing to tell about but that its just horrible how they can make movies like that in their right mind just cant understand that this cant be a hollywood movie is it just dont go watch this use your money more wisely

take:1 a famous play2 a director with now ideas of his own who is using3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 14 an actor for the lead - who has no feeling for the part hes playing and youll get: hamlet prinz von dänemarki listened to the radio play of hamlet with maximilian schell as hamlet and i was so disappointed i hoped that the filmed version would be better that schell would at least have a body language to underline what hes saying - nothing then the set the minimalistic design is not everyones taste but usually i like it when theres just enough on the stage to make clear whats the setting and nothing more alas thats on a stage in a theatre it wont work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings that the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which schell played the hamlet already lets say if that was the only thing to complain about i ask myself how schell could get the part of hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play hamlet a second time if youve got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on hamlet dont watch this one unless youre a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors
sandra bernhard is quite a character and certainly one of the funniest women on earth she began as a stand-up comedienne in the 1970s but her big break came in 1983 when she starred opposite jerry lewis and robert de niro in scorseses underrated masterpiece the king of comedy her film career never quite took off though she did make a couple of odd but entertaining pictures such as dallas doll 1994 or dinner rush 2000 but the most amazing parts were those she created for herselfwithout you im nothing is undoubtedly her best effort its an adaptation of her smash-hit off-broadway show which made her a superstar  and madonnas best friend for about four years in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scenes sandra turns from nina simone to diana ross talks about her childhood andy warhol and san francisco and performs songs made famous by burt bacharach prince or sylvester director john boskovich got sandra to do a 90-minute tour-de-force performance thats both sexy and uniquely funny if you are a bernhard fan you cant miss out this film; its a tribute as well to her weird beauty as to her extremely unconventional talent as a comedienne and it has influenced filmmakers in their work  hedwig and the angry inch for instance would look a lot different if without you im nothing didnt exist
absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so ill-researched its ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that its even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and agethe worst thats likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story remember in london as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the worldif it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but its not a high quality film so i just couldnt bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it isi would have given it 010 if such a rating existed! possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like
this one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very shortthe opening match was a waste of the legion of doom but i guess the only way they could have been eliminated by demolition was a double-dq otherwise mr perfect would have had to put in overtime kerry von erich the i-c champ was wasted here and this was the third ppv in a row where perfect jobbed remember before that he never lost a matchthe second match was very good possibly the best of the night ted dibiase and the undertaker were excellent while the jim neidhart had one of his wwf highlights pinning the honky tonk man koko b ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the big bossman and yokozuna this was a foreshadowing of bret harts singles career as he came back from two-on-one and almost survived the match he and dibiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was dibiases boring feud with dusty rhodeseven though the visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since 87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash this was the longest match of the night and jake did a repeat of his 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated i think he could have actually pulled off an upset these days the match would have ended the other way aroundone of the shortest ss matches ever was also one of its most surprising possibly the most underrated wrestler ever tito santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning boris zukhov tanaka and even the warlord in the final survival match it was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career sgt slaughter also did well getting rid of volkoff and the bushwhackers but that just wasnt a surprise tito wasi think the only point of the survival match was to have hogan and the warrior win together at the endthis show was boring and the matches were too short the undertakers debut was cool but tito santana is the reason i will remember this one
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this moviethere was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse the jokes that are attempted absolutley suck dont bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie dont watch it with your parents
i am a huge fan of the comic book series but this movie fell way below my expectations i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to itslow moving bad dialogue lots o bloodbut this was worse than anything i could have imagined the plot line is almost the same as the comic but the good points pretty much stop there the characters dont have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic bookwith the right people working on this project it could have been amazing sadly it wasnt that way so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out
this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production ever1 the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking spoiler there is about 15 minutes of just walking how 2 not to mention theres a lot of issues with the lighting and its almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day 3 the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater in mexico and then took the people who were turned awayplease for the love of everything holy dont rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public
my dad is a fan of columbo and i had always disliked the show i always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is but he goes on watching it none the less that is his right as an american i guess but my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that spielberg had directed the premier episode it was then that i was thankful that my dad had bought this show that i really cant stand i went through his dvd collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college my opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed but i did gain respect for spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors and that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along get the pun haha like spielberg did its like jesus before he became a man or thats at least what i think that would feel like any ways if your fan of columbo than you would most likely like this even though it contains little of peter falk i attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet this episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of columbos investigation as many later episodes would do
i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title until one day i was scrolling through john candys film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named once upon a crime something rang a bell and i clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memoriesive found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy it is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrillsthe movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an american couple who find a womans dog while vacationing in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body upon arrival from there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killerskind of a mix between its a mad mad mad mad world and a lighter hitchcock feature this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - such as john candy - to star in it the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isnt totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
after seeing all the jesse james quantrill jayhawkersetc films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee the scene of the attack of lawrence kansas is awesome the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys-meyers is outstanding as the bad guy all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours definitely worth seeing
fido is to be commended for taking a tired genre zombies and turning it into a most original film experience the early 50s atmosphere is stunning the acting terrific and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars eisenhower era dress art deco furniture and zombie servants it would be very easy to dismiss fido as cartoon-like fluff similar to tank girl but the two movies are vastly different fido has structure a script that tells a story and acting that is superior make no mistake this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed highly recommended - merk
this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial french government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated its a sense consistent with another movie ive seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika 2001 but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is its not just an impression -- things do happen in the movie -- but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the womans visit to south-western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective
never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent lets see: first they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread next they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget and finally when the film hits the theaters get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the multiplexes if necessary not on the merits of the film itself but because a #1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victorybut that of course wont be enough i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti-christianof course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldnt surprise anyone it is after all good old fashioned capitalism at work what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole left behind mindset as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality it leaves me scratching my head it would appear that there are many many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air what kind of reality i wonder are these people living in is this rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they fervently want to believe in and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and disillusioned will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the rapture is imminentin a way i almost wish that such an event would occur! what an interesting day that would be! what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the anthropological sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed but as more of a stephen spielberg production with boiling clouds trumpets angels descending out of the sky moon turned to blood the whole nine yards imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the evangelists had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit wouldnt that be somethingyet in the final analysis its that cold hard physical reality that i will content myself with my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently thank you very much
this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film schooli do not recommend this film to anyone who: a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or appreciationi do recommend this film to the average or below-average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of inebriationit is a total waste of what little production value it has
ok so i am an original wicker man fan and i usually dont like british films remade by americans so why oh why did i put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever i am not a nicolas cage fan and i had some kind of moment of madness perhaps the film was appalling! the bit at the beginning with the crashfire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where edward was going so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland well it wouldnt have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated the history behind the wicker man wasnt really explored - and i guess being set in america didnt really help the whole pagan theme this film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense i must say that the best bit was right at the end when nicolas cage goes up in flames! i am in such desperate need to see the original again now in order to cleanse my disappointed soul i really cant stress how disappointing this film is please dont see it if you:a dont like american re-makes of british films b are a fan of the original c hate nicolas cage
this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description but to me it was a bit of a let down very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed definitely not in sequential order also nothing of any consequence was being filmed i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewers part which is different from the typical hollywood film but this one befuddled me to no end i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didnt do anything for me i still dont really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a persons life i guess he succeeded but i was looking for more needless to say i cant recommend this movie to anyone
as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction but as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other so called horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with although it did have a little bit of the chill factor the whole concept of the evo electronic voice phenomena didnot seem believable this movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thrillerhorror moviesdefinitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it
i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right! this show is a total crud-pie! belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn the women are physically attractive but too stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell except except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell americas greatest comic character actor this guy plays belushis brother-in-law andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good thats like trying to make butt warts look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne-smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything hes in!
were talking about a low budget film and its understandable that there are some weaknesses no spoilers: one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic; but in general the story keeps you interested most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations i really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot i applaud this one on that if you know what i mean try to see also nueve reinas nine queens a film from argentina
everything a great documentary could be yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter aside from that seriously volken this is a movie that is completely inauthentic an adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy send-up with no trace of wit it means nothing feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters no wonder it has so many imdb fans! of course going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture no intelligence no wit other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness and no recognizable human emotion  just adrenaline darkon isnt a movie -- its a panic attack! avoid there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build-up such as darkon
i must have been only 11 when mr peepers started it was a must see for the whole family i believe on sun nights repeating gags were rob opening his locker he had to use a yardstick or pointer to gage the right spot on another locker and do some other things finally kicking the spot whereupon his door would open and taking pins out of a new shirtat the start of an episode he would open up a package with a new dress shirt and for the rest of the show be finding one pin after another that he missed when unwrapping the shirt timing was everything and the pins got lots of laughs i remember an aunt that drove a rio like jack benny and always wanted sonny to say something scientific he would think and come up with semi permeable membrane or osmosis causing her to say how brilliant he was you had to have been there marion lorne stole the show every time she was on screen why they didnt continue the series from her pov when wally quit he was afraid he was being typecast but by then it was way too lateill never know i saw somewhere that the 1st tv wedding big one anyway was tiny tim on the carson show horsecocky it was rob and nancy did i ever have the hots for her and i remember it made the cover of tv guide and got press in all the papers and major magazines a trip to the museum of broadcasting in nyc years ago was disappointing in that they had very few episodes then and those might be gone now i still remember it as wonderful and wish i had been a little older
ronald reagan and a bunch of us soldiers in a north korean pow camp they are tortured we learn north korean communists are bad people we learn americans beards grow very slowly during days of torturei tried to suppress it but i finally burst out laughing at this movie it was the scene when mr reagan comes out from telling the communists he wants to be on their side then he asks for a bottle of brandy next acting stone-cold sober he takes a drunken companion dewey martin to get sulfur to cure mr martins hangover of course the north korean communist guard is as dumb as they come so the drunk distracts the guard while reagan goes over to get something from a drawer which is next to a bunch of empty boxes im sure he boxes were supposed to contain something; but of course reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty ya gotta laugh! i think prisoner of war will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise its wasteful * prisoner of war 1954 andrew marton ~ ronald reagan steve forrest dewey martin
the only reason i even watched this was because i found it at my local library and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it and despite the plethora of tits and ass it didnt take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend terrible direction pedestrian camera work sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting chintzy effects and one of the worst screenplays ive had the displeasure of seeing brought to life such as it was horribly crippled and mutilated in a long long time best laughs actually come from the making of featurette in which the poor saps involved with this hdv mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special instead of something that wont be utterly forgotten next week wait! except for the fact that somehow someone lured tippi the birds hedren of all people into doing a bit part along with kane friday the 13th hodder! how this came to pass ill never know and to be honest i dont really care watch at your own risk and dont say you havent been warned this is film-making at its pretentious craven worst it only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women and even then just barely
this movie is very entertaining and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor it has some pretty good special effects and exciting action scenesas a finder of lost children murphys character starts off looking for a missing girl which leads him on the path for which others believe he was chosen - - to protect the golden child the young boy is born as an enlightened one destined to save the world from evil forces but whose very life is in danger if not for the help of murphy and his beautiful mysterious and mystical helperguideprotectoralso there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts one such scene is where the golden child that murphys character is solicited to protect is tested by the monks of the mountain temple an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from and the child is tested on his choicethis is a fantasycomedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware as we accept this premise of the plot we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy usthis is an excellent movie with a good plot fine acting and for the most part pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting and eddie murphy humor
this movie isnt as bad as i heard it was enjoyable funny and i love that is revolves around the holiday season it totally has me in the mood to christmas shop and listen to holiday music when this movie comes out on dvd it will take the place of christmas vacation in my collection it will be a movie to watch every year after thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year i heard that bens character was a bit crazy but i think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time take it for what is it a christmas comedy with a love twist i enjoyed it no it isnt titanic and it wont make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two so go laugh and have a good time:
i picked up tran scan from the library and brought it home we have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like the film was a total waste of time if i went out to buy it i would call it tran scam when i saw that it costs $49the dvd ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speedthere was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product if i would of done this project i would of provided more footage paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery to make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min oh yes the case said it was in stereo the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound thet could of at least put some music to itif you want a good cross canada film watch the railrodder national film board of canada starring buster keaton the one of the last film he made in this comical film buster keaton gets on to a railway trackspeeder in nova scotia and travels to british columbia
radio was not a 24 hour 7days a week happening when i grew up in the 1930s england so childrens hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power the few programmes i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the 3 that i recall still are toytown one about all the animals at the zoo and --- grey owl talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in recently that i learnt that grey owl wasnt a genuine indian but the tribute paid by the sioux chief makes great sense to me a man becomes what he dreams would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as archie grey owl belaney would that a new grey owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment
an insomniacs nightmare was an incredibly interesting well-made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main characters subconscious without coddling the viewerthe acting was top notch - honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them but this director knows what shes doing the lighting the cinematographyquality work im looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati!
this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every levelhowever if your after the true facts about such legends as hickcockcody and calamity jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legendthe story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this moviethe sharp eyed amongst you might just spot gabby hayes as an indian scout also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as cayenne warrior he actually married one of demilles daughters in real lifeindeed its quinns character who informs cooper of the massacre of custer told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it fuses the american west with american historyso please take time out to watch this classic western
i gave this movie a single star only because it was impossible to give it lessscientists have developed a formula for replicating any organism in their laba run down warehouse in la they create a t-rex a group of industrial spies break in to steal the formula and the remainder of the film is one endless foot chaseof course the t-rexa rubber puppetgets loose and commences to wipe out the cast it has the amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without them noticing and then promptly bites their head offone cast member escapes in a police car and spends the remainder of the film driving aimlessly through the city she is of such superior mental ability that she cant even operate the radio she never makes any attempt to drive to a substation or a donut shop and appears hopelessly lostthe t-rex wreaks havoc throughout the city there are blazing gun battles and buildingscardboard mock-upsblowing up but a single police car or the army nor anyone else ever shows up such activity must be commonplace in los angeleswe can only hope that a sequel isnt planned
set in a post-apocalyptic environment cyborgs led by warlord job rein over the human population they basically keep them as livestock as they need fresh human blood to live off nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid and years have past when she came face-to-face with the cyborgs again but this time shes saved by the cyborg gabriel who was created to destroy all cyborgs job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city while nea with revenge on mind pleads gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and shell get him to gabrielcheap low-rent cyborg post-apocalyptic foray by writer director albert pyun who made cyborg prior to it and the blistering nemsis the same year is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story as the turgid script is weak corny and overstated the leaden banter tries to be witty but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine the material couldve used another polish up as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone the open-ended cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt especially since a sequel has yet to be made makes it feel like that that run out of money and said time to pack up lets finish it off another day or maybe in another decade theres no rush however it did find it rather diverting thanks largely to its quick pace some well-executed combat and george mooradians gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop performances are fair kris kristoffersons dry and steely persona works perfectly as gabriel and a self-assured psychically capable kathy long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression however her acting is too wooden a mugging lance henriksen gives a mouth-watering performance of pure ham as the villainous cyborg leader job who constantly having a saliva meltdown scott paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and gary daniels pouts about as one too pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow-motion seeping into the background is a scorching but mechanical sounding music score the special effects and make-up fx stand up fine enough watchable but not quite a success and its minimal limitations can be a cause of that
awful this thriller should have buried what a piece of crap terrible writing characters are less than believable horrible schlock!! stick some b- stars in a terribly written pos to try and give it a little credit but it fails miserably if i didnt have to write ten lines about this movie i would have given it a word word review it starts with sh and ends with ithorrible ending retarded who writes this crap the ending of this film is so contrived weak its as if they had no idea what to do with this story line or they just ran out of money most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie its a good thing that these actors are on the way out because this would be a career killer good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it at least no one important like future investors it could have ended a thousand different ways but as it is i feel cheated out of my precious timedont bother with this one you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back
12 year old arnald hillerman accidentally kills his older brother eugene his feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him or feel it is not the right thing to do his only refuge is his grandfather who is the only one who seems to have compassion on him the realism will captivate true-2-life movie lovers but will not satisfy those that desire action & thrills
horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century way before the scary movie series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the 80s but like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss some like elvira mistress of the dark mostly rise above that but other like saturday the 14th and its sequel fail to deliver the laughs but out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and thats transylvania 6-5000 a major waste of time for many reasonspros: a great cast that does its best some of the dopey humor is amusing a corny but catch theme song some good transylvanian locationscons: threadbare plot mostly tedious pacing most of the humor just doesnt cut it the monsters are given little to do and little screen time i thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies lame ending that will likely make viewers angryfinal thoughts: this is a comedy if it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn aching for it to be over i cant believe anchor bay released this tired junk ill admit its not one of the worst films ever made but its not worth anyones time or money even if youre a fan of any of the actors see transylvania twist insteadmy rating: 25
the clouded yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations barry jones and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye jean simmons is quite good and trevor howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero
this was keatons first feature and is in actuality three shorts set in different periods stone age roman age modern age on the eternal triangle of romance the stories parallel each other as in griffiths intolerance which this was intended to satirize the strengths of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms bringing modern day business into ancient settings**** warning - spoilers follow to elaborate best points ******here are the classic moments:using a turtle as a wee-gee board stone age; a wrist watch containing a sun dial roman age; a chariot with a spare wheel roman age; using a helmet as a tire lock roman age; early golf with clubs and rocksstone age; dictating a will being carved into a rock stone age; the changing weather forecaster roman age; the chariot race in snow -buster using skis and huskies with a spare dog in the chariots bootroman agethe above are all throw-away gags that keep us chuckling there are however unforgettable moments as well:buster taking out shaving equipment to match girl putting on make-up; the fantastic double take when an inebriated buster gazes at his plate to discover a crab staring up at him within one second he has leaped to stand on his chair from a sitting position and leaped again into the arms of the waiter - one of the funniest moments ive ever seen and that lion - the manicure -just brillianttheres also an off-color bit of racism when four african-american litter bearers abandon their mistress for a roman crap gamekinos print is a bit fuzzy and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate deterioration and film damage- most probably at ends of reels the metro feature is scored with piano and flute and borrows heavily from grieglots of fun and full of laughs
cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual 30 sec ad for geico the makeup was half ass-ed to say the least hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials that in it self makes for a lousy show perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance instead the pilot lacked a good story line i give this show a 1 out of 10 i would of liked to put a zero out of 10 but that was not an option i pray for a quick death to this show id give it less then 5 episodes before it dies a deserving death
i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this dont miss this one
routine suspense yarn about a sociopath dillon who gives his sperm to a clinic of human reproduction and starts to harrass the lives of the woman antony and his husband mancuso extremely predictable far-fetched and with undecided tone all the way dont lose your time with this onemake a baby instead!
mario lanza of course is the great caruso in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth dorothy kirsten eduard franz and ludwig donath this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary world-renowned tenor whose name is known even todaythe film is opulently produced and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza kirsten judmila novotna blanche thebom and other opera stars who appeared in the film if youre a purist seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from lucia will strike you as odd - even if carusos wife dorothy just had a baby girl also its highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia; the role lay too high for himin taking dramatic license the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of carusos life what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire yet this is never mentioned in the film these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in girl of the golden west there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga the reason for that photo his only shirt was in the laundry he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company later rca victor he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquakeinstead the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha which never happened he had a hemorrhage during lelisir damore at the met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the met his last role as eleazar in la juive what killed him the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis his first role at the met was not radames in aida as indicated in the film but the duke in rigoletto so when it says on the screen suggested by dorothy carusos biography of her husband thats what it was - suggested what is true is that dorothys father disowned her after her marriage and left her $1 of his massive estate they also did have a daughter gloria together who died at the age of 79 on 1072007 however caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothysome people say that lanzas voice is remarkably like carusos but just listen to caruso sing in the film match point -- carusos voice is remarkably unlike lanzas in fact from his sound had he wanted to caruso could have sung as a baritone he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was othello a dramatic tenor role which lanza definitely was not lanzas voice deserved not to be compared with another he made a unique contribution to film history popularizing operatic music he sings the music in the great caruso with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career his acting is natural and genuine ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herselfreally a film for opera lovers and lanza fans which are probably one and the same
michael keaton is johnny dangerously in this take-off on gangster movies done in 1984 maureen stapleton plays his sickly mother griffin dunne is his da brother peter boyle is his boss and marilu henner is his girlfriend other stars include danny devito and joe piscopo keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him in flashback how he came to own the pet store he turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation $4995 special this week and began working for a mob boss boyle johnny uses the last name dangerously in the mobster worldthere are some hilarious scenes in this film and stapleton is a riot as johnnys foul-mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced peter boyle as johnnys boss gives a very funny performance as does griffin dunne a straight arrow da who wont play ball with crooked burr danny de vito as johnnys nemesis joe piscopo is great richard dimitri is a standout as moronie who tortures the english language - but you have to hear him do it rather than read about it what makes it funny is that he does it all with an angry facethe movie gets a little tired toward the end but its well worth seeing and keaton is terrific as good boybad boy johnny for some reason this film was underrated when it was released and like keatons other gem night shift you dont hear much about it today with some performances and scenes that are real gems youll find johnny dangerously immensely enjoyable
first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg burt reynolds is not boss hogg and even worse was mc gainey as roscoe if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this moviethe movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop but goes on to win the race
i like this presentation - i have read bleak house and i know it is so difficult to present the entire book as it should be and even others like little dorrit - i have to admit they did a very good show with the staged nicholas nickelby i love diana rigg and i could see the pain of lady dedlock even through the expected arrogance of the aristocracy i am sorry i think she is the best lady dedlock i am not sure who could have made a better jarndyce but i am ok with mr elliott it is not easy to present these long dickens books - oliver twist would be easier - this is a long and if you dont care for all the legal situations can be dreary or boring i think this presentation is entertaining enough not to be boring i just loved mr smallweed - it can be entertaining there is always a child - jo will break your heart here i think we should be given a chance to judge for ourselvesi have to say i loved the show maybe if i read the book again as i usually do after seeing the movie maybe i can be more critical in the meantime - i think it is a good presentation
a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter otoole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter otoole and susannah york get to overact
this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly cant promote winning bridge so the satire didnt work for me but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings at one point he even enumerates one two three four as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event and people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches that spoof worked very well indeedunfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire paul lukas doesnt have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh werent given good enough lines; glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter what a waste of talent!
drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth i loved segals early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him i just saw this movie ok fell asleep about 90% through so i didnt see the end when i woke up and saw i was at the dvd menu i was thankful i didnt subject myself to any more of that movie and didnt dare find out what happened at the end there was something strange about the voice of segal and others kinda reminded me of the original mad max where the voice were dubbed but in the same language australlian is english right : anyway if i had 10 thumbs theyd all point down right now for this segal injustice
yes this production is long good news for bronte fans! and it has a somewhat dated feel but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you wont want to watch any other versions!timothy dalton is edward rochester its that simple i dont care that other reviewers claim hes too handsome dalton is attractive certainly but no pretty-boy in fact he possesses a craggy angular dark charm that in my mind is quite in keeping with the mysterious very masculine mr r and he takes on rochesters sad tortured persona so poignantly he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it but also displays rochesters tender passionate emotional side as well imo the newer a&e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout ive read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beastwhen i reread the novel i always see zelah clarke as jane ms clarke to me resembles jane as she describes herself and is described by others small childlike fairy though its true the actress doesnt look 18 she portrays janes attributes so well while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and passionate nature in check her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen who was the picture of demure submission although her true nature was dissimilar jane learned to master her temper and appear docile in keeping with the schools aims for its charity students who would go into service jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr rochester she would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal even later on when she gave as well as she got she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer nevertheless if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-temperedthe chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right i think no it does not in the least resemble hollywood thank god! its not a hollywood sort of book but theirs is a romance which is true devoted and loyal and for a woman like jane who never presumed to have *any* love come her way it is a minor miraclethe rest of the casting is terrific and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here so too is much of the rich poetic original dialogue this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely infamous gypsy scene and in general features more humor than other versions ive seen in particular the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!jane eyre was in many ways one of the first novelized feminists she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently and at last as rochesters true equal just beautiful!
i watched this show and i simply didnt find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because its average compared to them
but the rest of us who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you cryingenjoy! tom hulce is magnificent as dominick a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother eugene played by ray liotta who is a doctor and who works very long hours due to eugenes work schedule dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls he really just wants to be a good boy to do the right thing and to make his brother proud of him he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started not about to give anything away here but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story its loving characters and a great song i cannot quote here that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriatebut you hear it in a bari thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie since he was for amadeus i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning no such luck liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact but then he does later on all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she doesnt have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget
definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable youll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos--imans appearance is especially self-deprecating its also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from the sopranos typecast themselves

vampyres aspect ratio: 185:1sound format: monoa motorist murray brown is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women marianne morris and anulka and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human bloodtaking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director jean rollin in france and consolidated by the success of hammers carmilla series in the uk jose ramon larraz daring shocker vampyres pushed the concept of adult horror much further than british censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974 and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original british release it isnt difficult to see why! using its gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity sex and bloodshed as the films short running time will allow larraz who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym d daubeney uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human conditionshot on location at a picturesque country house during the autumn of 1973 harry waxmans haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with symptoms a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel however despite its pretensions vampyres wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished the male lead brown past his prime at the time of filming is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud a must-see item for cult movie fans an amusing curio for everyone else vampyres is an acquired taste watch out for silent era superstar bessie love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie
canadians are too polite to boo but the audience at the toronto film festival left the theater muttering that they would rate this film 0 or 1 on their voting sheets the premise is that a modern filmmaker is interpreting a 17th century fable about the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when druids were the spiritual leaders working in three epochs presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms including silly and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which cross-dressing and assorted farcical situations arise the film could have been hilarious as a monty python piece which it too closely resembles but rohmers effort falls very flat the audience laughed at the sight jokes but otherwise bemoaned the slow pace the ending comes all in a rush and is truly awful this is a trivial film and a waste of your movie going time
i was totally impressed by shelley adriennes waitress 2007 this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director an original and unique artist she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge male lead reg rodgers looking like judd nelson is fine there is also a great cameo by ben vereen the song at the end of the movie the bastard song written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy: its a world of sufferingin a sea of painno matter how much sun you bringyoure pummeled by the raindont let the heartless get you downdont greet the heartless at your doordont live among the heartless
bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesnt get any better than this zadoras over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such dont miss ray liottas debut film line looks like a penis
this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment it takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats brat brothers over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters im almost surprised its disney!to its credit 8 simple rules knows its a comedy and doesnt try to be more too many shows eg sister sister and lizzie mcguire think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting this is a trap 8 simple rules has avoided; it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his characterand i think although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark 8 simple rules can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesnt make cates father a second version of paul hennessy
well it looked good on papernick cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci codeamerican history 101 and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed 2 is to speed a reasonable castincluding john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the freemasonshowever these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar and nobody mention from hell or jack the ripperi dont think ive revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no climax- it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour
over the years weve seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what keeping 8 simple rules going after john ritter died comes to mind but this is probably the first time i cared the idea of having that 70s show without eric or to a lesser extent kelso is ridiculous they tried to cover it up with a comeback of leo and increasingly outrageous story lines but it always felt like why bother when you dont have a main character anymore it just didnt really connect it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasnt even funny the last season felt like the season too much for every single character simply because eric used to take a lot of screen time and now wed be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were focusing on the gimmick that is fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working because the whole deal was that hed say something weird from out of nowhere and you cant say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours they also brought in the standard cousin oliver only this time it just wasnt a kid whenever you heard somebody knock on the door you started praying it wasnt randy please let it not be randy the deal with randy was that hed do really awful jokes usually as red would say smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and donna would be in stitches i think more than half of the last season was donna pretending to be amused the problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasnt about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera everybody started being in love with everybody emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching as the world turns im guessing this was character development but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from family matters to be fair the last episode also because it had a cameo by topher grace a cameo in his own show was really good even if not that funny eitherby the way yet more criticism on season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme not only did they use the same joke twice a character not singing fez scared the hell out of me dude dont open your eyes that far but the first five seasons or soamong the best comedy ever broadcast
i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story the acting by nolte lee arkin and the supporting cast was superb the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details
flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever madethis flick exposes all the clichés and then some! excruciatingly bad downs-syndrome! actors terribly heavy self important dialog scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat jarring editing pointless plot points all wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivelit achieves exactly what it was designed to a hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders to show to their parents when they ask them what theyve been doing for the last two years! after what is it received its cannes award presenter werner herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof in part of his own films! he supposedly blew up at the info to this day he refuses to discuss the incidentanyway see it and laugh this will be a classic of humor for many years to come
this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score ive been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and its all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once youve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director its a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody
daniel day lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites it is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the characters he plays making them reali remember many years ago we had a party in our house - the friends came over we were sitting around the table eating drinking the wine talking laughing - having a good time the tv was on - there was a movie which we did not pay much attention to then suddenly all of us stopped talking and laughing the glasses did not clink the forks did not move the food was getting cold on the plates we could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor when he finished writing that one word we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his characterjim sheridans my left foot is an riveting unsentimental bio-drama about christy brown the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his lifei like every one of day lewiss performances i have mixed feelings about his performance in gony but i believe that his greatest role was christy brown in my left foot
kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeares obscure rarely-produced comedy into a 1930s-era musical with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both particularly painful is nathan lane who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english classthe musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimers contribution as eye candy but they have given far better performances than in this film and youd be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass
what to say about this movie well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the schools basement that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever though that is not fair some people like tromas movies and they can watch it if they want troma movies for me though are the worst movies there are out there i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity
carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticismthen something happened and he turned into just another dull holier-than-thou directoril mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line working class = kind and warm while upper-class = snob and devious but love wins in the endsuch a trite clichè for such a smart directorthere isnt really too much to talk about in the movie every character is a walking stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but wholl become good again the scorned wife the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest-but-poor guy acting is barely averageseverely disappointing under every aspect
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so i am happy to see any of their films professor noodle lucien littlefield is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula with the ability to reverse ageing after twenty years ollie and stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic after breaking an extension stan gets a replacement a loaded gun from off the wall and of course it fires the brush off stan goes up to have a look and ollie standing on the attic door of the roof falls into the greenhouse stan asks if he was hurt and ollie only answers with i have nothing to say ollie gets back on the roof and he and stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the chimney ollie hatless in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down and the butler jessup sam adams is covered in chimney ash smoke oh and ollie still has nothing to say to stan the boys decide to clean up the mess and when stan tears the carpet with the shovel ollie asks cant you do anything right and stan replies i have nothing to say getting the shovel bashed on his head as ollie holds a bag for stan to shovel in the ashes they get distracted by a painting on the wall and the ashes end up down ollies trousers so stan gets another shovel bashed on the head professor noodle finishes his formula and does a final test on a duck with a drop in a tank of water changing it into a duckling he also shows the boys his success turning the duckling into an egg and he next proposes to use a human subject ie his butler while hes gone the boys decide to test the formula for themselves but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula in the end what was once ollie comes out an ape and when stan asks him to speak all ollie ape says is i have nothing to say and stan whimpers filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film it is an enjoyable film stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian very good!
this is how i feel about the showi started watching the show in reruns in 2001i enjoy the show but it had too many faultsi hate the michelle & joey characters!stealing story lines from old tv shows they even stole from the partirdge family then in 1 episode the partridge family was mentionedactors playing different roles in different episodes mtv martha quinn the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in 1 episodethe michelle character could not take a joke but then they had this little kid act out revenge to her sisters for a joke by them on herstory lines that came & went in 1 episode joey getting the tv show with frankie & annette never heard from it again after that danny all of a sudden playing the guitar 1 episode he is coaching soccer 1 episode he is coaching softballbaseball 1 game & you are out huh danny jesse & joey keep getting jobs really quickly with no experience only in a tv showi did like the dj & stephanie characters wish jodie sweetin could have learned from candace cameron bure & had a clean non drug adult life
i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful i didnt feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutesthis movie blew me away!!!!!! it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today: a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions entailed the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side! an absolute must see!!
i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor like many others on here i dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be called a horror the plot was so wafer thin it cant be a drama there was no suspense so it cant be a thriller its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasnt there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting a deer it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didnt
i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider its still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts although theres hardly any action the ending is still shocking in its ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit
delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today the film is also casting some of the great actors of our time not just from france but from everywheremy favorite segments:14th arrondissement: carol margo martindale from denver comes to paris to learn french and also to make a sense of her lifemontmartre: there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic parisloin du 16ème: an image of paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the cités ana catalina sandino moreno spends more time taking care of somebody elses kid shes a nanny than of her ownquartier latin: so much fun to see gérard depardieu as the tenancier de bar with gena rowlands and ben gazzara discussing their divorcetour eiffel: dont tell me you didnt like those mimes!tuileries: such a treat to see steve buscemi as the tourist whos making high-contact a no- no with a girl in the metroparc monceau: nick nolte is great ludivine sagnier alsoive spend 3 days in paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back!seen in barcelona another great city at the verdi on march 18th 200784100 ***
this movie was kind of interestingi had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesnt really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it ive seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it onlineso basically this movie was a waste of time to watch
this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining- good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again-say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
this is my kind of film i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a horrorthriller there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedybut either way it is a fascinating descent into madness the ending caught me off guard but what an ending! it leaves the viewer a lot to think aboutpowerful performances a complex and detailed plot a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watchingpersonally i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do
lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is infectiousthe show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro mike nelson there were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than 1 episode but each show holds its own with any other show produced during this era the infancy of american television
sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones well thats my opinion anyway this one will always be in the bad movie category simply because all but shu qis performance was terriblemartial angel tells of cat shu qi a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover chi lam julian cheung two years before but her past returns to haunt her as chi lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company cat works for in order to rescue him she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days six other feisty women to save the dayi may have told the synopsis cheesily but this is a cheesy story in fact the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice-paper in water if i could sum it up take a bad jackie chan movie remove the comedy remove the choreography throw away the budget and you have martial angels: a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at allmind you i do have to give credit where credits due and shu qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action as it was her performance that shone through okay you cant say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she did manage to dig some character out from her role other than that only sandra ng and kelly lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimmers and very briefelsewhere the film just fell to pieces scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes camera angles that were elementary and unflattering and direction ive seen better from a lost dogi guess this film was a too many cooks affair most probably the budget was blown away on the over-enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen that didnt leave much elsefrankly the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn charlies angels it aint in fact while sisters can do it for themselves none of that was really that apparent heredefinitely one to forget
after a lively if predictable opening bank-heist scene set it off plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink this is a movie that deals in nasty threadbare stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling in short its no different from 90% of hollywood product but its the racial angle that makes set it off a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making posing as a celebration of sistahood the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican-american gangsta stereotype the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else worse set it off exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery then theyre ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring guilt-ridden liberals tell that to rodney king and aspirational good sista jada pinkett smith follows the path of upward mobility out of the hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend set it off illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the hood while all the time despising it while the likes of shaft and superfly in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots they had a freshness an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch set it off wouldnt be worth getting angry over if wasnt a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african-american film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s
i thought the racism and prejudice against carl brashear was grossly overdramatized for hollywood effect i do not believe the u s navy was ever that overtly racist i cannot imagine a full captain the commanding officer ever telling his chief to intentionally flunk anyone certainly not at the risk of his life and there has never been a chief petty officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but wasps as deniros character no chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to master chief in the first place cuba gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie
after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about teenage witches yet has to be made i didnt think much of the craft and im not into charmed either the only film i more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was little witches 1996 and even that one wasnt very good but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies you will also enjoy midnight offeringsi was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80s movie about teenage witches in high school but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious the acting is decent and serious all the time no jokes are being played by teenagers or something and the musical score at first i thought was pretty good it added some scariness and also something classy with the use of threatening violins and all but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious they didnt have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speedthen theres melissa sue anderson who was the main reason for me to see this movie a few weeks ago i saw her in happy birthday to me a rather enjoyable thick-plotted and goofy on some occasions slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings and i must say she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch vivian but the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! vivian causes a death and an accident yes but thats it then theres robin the good witch who is just learning about her powers and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches and whats worse i was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects flaming eyes or whatever but nothing happens there is sort of a confrontation in the end but its a big disappointmentso the acting of the two witches was good the musical score was decent even though overly ambitious and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times but that doesnt make a good movie yet does it
kazans early film noir won an oscar some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism and rate it very highly i can almost see where they are coming from but i prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of new orleans and it is up to a military doctor widmark and a city detective douglas to apprehend the main carrier palance the film is moody shot in stark black and white and makes very good use of locations widmark is wonderful as usual forget the symbolism crime equals disease and disease equals crime and just enjoy the chase it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived post wwii through the early 1950s and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher for those who will be watching this for the first time sit tight for the big chase at the end it is something else and frankly i dont know how they filmed some of it i can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie
theres a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldnt direct a horror film of quality if he had to and sleepwalkersscreenplay written by stephen kingis often used as an example of this i like sleepwalkers though i fully am aware that garris just says f#ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie forget character or plot development who needs them anyway its about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkersfeline-human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents moving from town to town living a nomadic existence truly powerfulset their sights on a teenager who doesnt surrender without a fight before all is said and done many will be slaughtered as a mother shant tolerate the possible death of her beloved songarris wastes little time setting up those to be executed as a teacherglenn shadix suspecting handsome all american charmer charles bradybrian krauseto be someone entirely different from who he claims gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into charles lures pretty virgins into his arms drawing their energy in turn feeding his hungry mama maryalice krige the fresh new target is tanya robertsonmädchen amick and she seems to be easy pickens but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a strugglethanks to a deputys cat clovis marys vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way mary come hell or high water will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying sonlike many teenagers i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies such as amy dolenz i was smitten with mädchen amick shes simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles unaware of his ulterior motives i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen but this would never be the case too bad because i wouldve welcomed her in the genre with open armskrige is yummy as the menacing damn sexy but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanyas parents in one fail swoop in less than ten or so minutes she stabs one in the back with a corn cob! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman before cracking his arma bone protruding knocking him unconscious with his own elbow! she tosses tanyas mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her fathers face! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charlescop-kebab! falling on the pencil for extra impact poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary driven to the brady home and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans we see mary and charles abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers joe dante and john landis as photograph expertsthe film is shot in a tongue-in-cheek let-it-all-hang-out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home its about the ultra-violence simple as that with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris direction and kings screenplay the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in-your-face without a lick of complexity this is closer in vein to kings own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works
origins of the care bears & their cousins if you saw the original film youll notice a discrepancy the cousins are raised with the care bears rather than meeting them later however i have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations the babies are adorable and its fun watching them play and grow my favourite is swift heart rabbit the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either cree summer is excellent as christy the songs are sweet and memorable if you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed 910
i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater 3000 thankfully mike crow and tom servo are watchable because the film itself is not although there is a plot a story one can follow and a few actors that can act there isnt anything else the movie was so boring i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom crow and mike as summarized above however it was better than the film featured in the mst3k episode that preceded it; mitchell
pickup on south street is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists the action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing the use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality samuel fullers style of directing and the cinematography by joseph macdonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphereace pickpocket and repeat offender skip mccoy richard widmark gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named candy jean peters on the new york subway she was being used by her ex-boyfriend joey richard kiley to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her she was carrying us government secrets recorded on microfilm two fbi agents had been following candy and witnessed the theft one of the agents continues to tail her back to joeys apartment and the other zara willis bouchey visits police captain dan tiger murvyn vye zara explains that the fbi has been following candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist groupin order to identify the pickpocket tiger calls in a stoolie called moe thelma ritter who after being given a precise description of the cannons method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects once tiger sees skips name on the list hes immediately convinced that hes the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him when skip is brought into tigers office zara tells him about the microfilm and tiger offers to drop any charges if hell co-operate with the investigation skip is flippant and arrogant he clearly doesnt trust tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subwayjoey orders candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it candy pays moe for skips address and when skip returns from being questioned by tiger he finds candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money when she recovers skip demands payment of $25000 for the microfilm she tells joey about skips demand and joeys boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following eveningskip and candy are attracted to each other and its because of their uneasy developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police it soon becomes apparent however that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct actionthe depictions of skip candy and moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compellingmoes work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time she appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as an old clock running down and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in long island her belief that every buck has a meaning of its own leads her to sell any information regardless of danger friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal thelma ritters performance certainly merited the oscar nomination she earned for her roleskip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again despite this he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely is merely philosophical when moe betrays his whereabouts and then later he even ensures that moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident widmark and peters are both perfect for their roles and like ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction
ive been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons:1 this is without doubt the worst film ive ever seen 2 unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3 i was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it ive seen it in shops for 15 pound don not pay that much for this film! you will be very angry 4 there are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating in my opinion and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminalthe plot summary: a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings baby-sitting he kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the policewhy is it so bad to begin with the acting is very very bad someone else compared it to a school production no this is worse than any acting ive seen on a school stageive bought a number of these previously banned films from the dvd company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this okay the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense what was the point in making this film when there isnt even any gore! okay no gore what else can a film like this offer breats no not even any titillation!its true this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyerwatcher of this film should be fairly advised that this film is at best worth only one out of ten
the memory banks of most of the reviewers here mustve short-circuited when trying to recall this cubic zirconia of a gem because practically everyone managed to misquote lloyd bochners walter thornton when in a fit of peevish anger he hurls the phallic garden nozzle at his new wife jerilee randall-thornton a nearly comatose pia zadora which was used to sexually assault her earlier in the moviebut im getting ahead of myself in any case poor lloyd couldve been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put-upon co-starhard as it is for most of us to believe especially these days nobody in hollywood sets out to intentionally make a bad movie this is certainly not the most defensible argument to make since there just seem to be so damn many of them coming out but then again there is that breed of film that one must imagine during the time of its creation from writing casting and direction mustve been cursed with the cinematic equivalent of trying to shoot during the ides of marchthe lonely lady is in that category and represents itself very well considering the circumstances here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflé: pia zadora a marginal singeractress so determined to be taken seriously that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers which this movie most certainly did!; a somewhat high-profile novel written by the trashmaster himself harold robbins of the carpetbaggers and dreams die first fame; a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all that they tried to play this dreck like it was clifford odets or ibsen; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck and was probably contractually obligated not to demand the use of the alan smithee moniker to protect what was left of his reputation like lamont johnsons lipstick meir zarchis i spit on your grave roger vadims barbarella paul verhoevens showgirls or the grandmammy of really bad film-making frank perrys mommy dearest the lonely lady is still often-discussed usually with disgust disbelief horrified laughter or a unique combination of all three yet also defies dissection description or even the pretzel logic of hollyweird nobodys sure how it came to be how it was ever released in even a single theater or why its still here and nearly impossible to get rid of but take it or leave it it is here to stay and i dont think that lovers of really good bad movies would have it any other way
mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfitsthe special effects look like they are from the 70s the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain awfulthe only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kidsthere are far better shows for your kids to watch!try giving your kids something like nickelodean those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers
mae clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face james cagney showed a grapefruit into in the same years the public enemy she will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a hoods girl who finds that her past will always be with herin some ways this looks a bit antique for 1931 almost as if you are looking at 1928s famously inert lights of new york but dont be fooled although ted tetzlaffs photography is still in the big scenes theres lots of movement indicating distraction to the moviegoers in the set-ups to them but in competition with the fast-paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at warners this attempt to bring the womans viewpoint into the genre as a tearjerker doesnt work nor is mae clarke the actress to carry the effort
mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive 120-page point-by-point line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his debunking report which is titled a skeptics guide to an inconvenient truth can be found at is :wwwceiorg a shorter 10-page version can be found at: wwwceiorgpdf5539pdf once you read those demolitions youll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the y2k scare of 1999 which gore also endorsed as he did the pseudo-scientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber as james the amazing randi does to psychics and philip klass does to ufos and gerald posner does to jfk conspir-idiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al gores movie and the whole global warming scam
the funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of jules vernes classic journey to the center of the earth is verne spinning in his grave the only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with journey to the center of the earth is the title otherwise everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching in fact the director has written here at imdbcom that he directed only eight minutes of journey to the center of the earth and the studio tacked on part of dollman helmer albert pyuns sequel to his own alien from la with kathy ireland evidently the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations they grafted pyuns sequel onto director rusty lemorandes movie please dont rent or buy this wretched piece of garbageunlike director henry levins period piece journey to the center of the earth 1959 with james mason and pat boone lemorandes journey to the center of the earth takes place in contemporary times in hawaii two fellows a british nanny and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence richard paul carafotes of blind date and his comic book obsessed brother bryan ilan mitchell-smith of weird science are going out to explore a cave the heroine crystina nicola cowper of underworld works for a domestic service called nannies r us being a nanny has been crystinas life-long dream but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs nevertheless her sympathetic supervisor ms ferry lynda marshall of africa express sends her to hawaii crystinas new client rock star billy foul jeremy crutchley of doomsday who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career has a dog named bernard foul wants crystina to take bernard to a doggie day spa crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals bernard in richards jeep you see foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises foul has disguised the dog as a human baby anyway crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow richardafter she catches up with them to get her dog the cabbie cruises away and abandons her crystina demands that richard drive her back to town but he has other plans unhappily crystina joins the guys and they get lost and then find themselves in the lost city of atlantis a police state ruled by a dictator at the center of the earth the rulers of atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist our heroes and heroine stumble onto atlantis quite by accident atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera the ruler of atlantis general rykov janet du plessis of operation hit squad is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human wanda saknussemm kathy ireland of necessary roughness to visit atlantis predictably general rykov machinations to rule atlantis and overthrow the earth fails and our heroes and heroine save the dayjourney to the center of the earth is an abomination the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships albert pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga
one of the finest films ever made! why it only got a 76 rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi goldbergs work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again dont miss this movie which should have won the oscar and read the book too!
this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura to throw in a couple of high-falutin european terms! this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their rolesthe story moves briskly and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of 1880s san francisco all in all theres little not to like about this filmvery well worth the time to watch it
the beaver trilogy is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made i was lucky enough to catch it along with a q&a session with director trent harris at the ny video festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of trents website this movie has to be seen to be believed! i sincerely recommend searching for trents name on the web and then buying the film from his site hes an incredibly nice guy to boot dont get confused: the cameraman in the fictional sections of the beaver trilogy is not trent!after having seen the trilogy a few times i do have to admit that i could probably do without the sean penn version its like a try-out version for the crispin glover orkly kid section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if youre a penn fan than it being a good video penn is pretty funny though and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty b&w videothis is probably also one of crispin glovers best roles and i would just love to see an updated documentary about the original groovin gary once you see this film youll never get garys nervous laughter out of your head ever again
this is my favorite of the older tom & jerry cartoons from the early 40s the original version with mammy two shoes is on the tom & jerry spotlight collection 2 set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons the gags on this one arent all madcap avery style but more subtle and aimed at anyone whos ever stayed up late watching scary movies or radio programs! tom is listening to a creepy radio show and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him the nine-lives gag is well done here and i dont know how many times i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when i was a kid when toms owner is awakened by the ruckus- mammy was not the maid it was her house- she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh get your pause button ready its worth it!
if you havent seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and youll be seeing her in the theaters soon this was evas first film and she does a fantastic job acting she was 24 when she shot it and looked hot then as for this low budget film its pretty good for the first time director who has another soon to be released movie juarez mexico currently playing at many film festivals across the united states in fact it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news what would be nice to see is a snitch2 with a higher budget
if this is the first of the nemesis films that you have seen then i strongly urge you to proceed no further the sequels to nebula prove to be no betterhard to believe considering this entry is bottom-of-the-barrel this movie tries but its just not worth your time folks take a nap instead
errol flynn is gentleman jim in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett known as the man who beat john l sullivan directed with a light hand by flynns good friend raoul walsh the film also stars alexis smith jack carson alan hale sr william frawley and ward bond flynn plays an ambitious egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late 1800s though good-natured the fact that he is a shanty irishman and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members; most of them cant wait to see him lose a fight and they bet against him despite this he rises to fame even working as an actor finally he gets the chance hes been waiting for a match with the world champion john l sullivan ward bond sullivan demands a $10000 deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the $25000 purse corbett and his manager frawley despair of getting the money however help comes in the form of a very unlikely individualthis is a very entertaining film and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn who himself was a professional fighter at one time he has the requisite charm good looks and athleticism for the role alexis smith plays victoria ware his romantic interest who insists that she hates him in real life she doesnt seem to have existed; corbett was married to olive lake morris from 1886 to 1895the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form in the film corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents; it is believed that he wore down john l sullivan this waygood film to catch flynn at the height of his too-short time as a superstar
when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean im sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it: executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and theyre playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20s not their 40s the story was just plain bad and obnoxiousdee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blondes they really dont have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world its just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think theyre just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girlsdenise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens its more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell110
the only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequelfrom start to finish the tooth fairy was just downright terrible it seemed like a badly-acted childrens movie which got confused with a wizard of oz witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearinghalf of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion the sister of the two brothers cherise the aura reader and mrs mcdonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldnt be bothered the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on at least try and have a slight plot for them the story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witchadd the weak plot and the weak acting together the children are particularly wooden and the movie ends up a complete failure if only mst3k could have had a go at this one
not to be confused with lewis teagues alligator 1980 which actually is an excellent film this il fiume del grande caimano laboriously ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino made around the end of the seventies including the rather watchable lisola degli uomini pesce and the not so good la montagna del dio cannibale tracing outrageously the plot of jaws the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever the creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable stelvio ciprianis lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptiles meal no thrill out of this rather laughters actually! and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude we could excuse badly made films and poor fxs but not that kind of mentality never!
i saw this film on the history channel today in 2006 first of all i realize that this is not a documentary -- that it is a drama but one might hope that at least the critical facts that the story turns on might be based on actual events reagan was shot and the other characters were real people the movie got that right from there on reliance on facts rapidly decays i had never heard of this movie before seeing it having been a tv reporter at the time of these events i was stunned that i had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of secretary haig as portrayed by richard dreyfuss the whole nation had heard the i am in control etc but dreufuss haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally having watched the film i began researching the subject on the internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the situation room conversations that this film pretends to reenact incredibly many the the principal facts of the film meant to show a white house secret service etc in total chaos -- and the nations leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war -- are demonstrably incorrect they didnt happen! there is internal conflict to be sure haig makes missteps his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is difficult but there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film there are too many gross errors to list but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish enlighten inform entertain i believe they failed on all three fronts it is difficult to ascribe motives to others but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention and as for my beloved history channels reel to real follow-on documentary there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film -- namely the events within the administration on the day of the shooting so the viewer was left to research those without much -- if any -- help from the network
yikes it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie for some of the names in the cast id expect a much better movie im almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part i hope the money was worth it and the students they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster i mean ive fenced its a fun sport but ive never been that intense the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back
i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see its great
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something 50 times worsegot thatok now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie ive ever seen there were a few cheap laughsvery few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funnythe only reason im not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasnt written or directed anything else and its not surprise why
im a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know-nothings when it comes to movie production i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into in short the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind
i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan i decided to watch it myself earlier this weekit is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships she literally bumps into brian kerwin a regular married guy with kidsafter driving her car into the back of his after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plotthe other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan lois chiles steven bauer & stella stevens they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine
can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did sucksomehow hugh jackman is a rat - a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london - to an extent throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainmenti would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up d-
while i certainly consider the exorcist to be a horror classic i have to admit that i dont hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that i havent seen many of the exorcist rip-offs and if exorcismo is anything to go by ill have to say thats a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! in fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs this is often considered one of the worst and so maybe it wasnt the best place for me to start its not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically its the same as the one in the exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit which happens to be the spirit of her dead father the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism like many spanish horror films this one stars paul naschy who is pretty much the best thing about the film exorcismo was directed by juan bosch who previously directed the derivative spanish giallo the killer wore gloves i havent seen any of his other films but on the basis of these two: i believe that originality wasnt one of his strong points theres not a lot of good things i can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isnt worth waiting for i certainly dont recommend it!
another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the *spoiler* wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the cool kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those whove watched it before and those whove seen it before will probably watch it again; those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye candy--go with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask
i thought harvey keitel a young fresh from the sex pistols john lydon then as a bonus the music by ennio morricone i expected an old-school edgy italian cop thriller that was made in america istead i got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: wtf!!! too many unanswered questions and not enough action the result: a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet keitel and lydon work well together so maybe quentin tarantino can reunite these guys with better script oh and the morricone score: ok but not memorableoverall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore keitel fan
the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what i guess makes him so mean i dont think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end but then there you have it a candy-bar ending that makes me look back and say hokie as hell a pretty good movie until the end ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning and then there is the aftermath of what happened guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending im left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end
as a dane im proud of the handful of good danish movies that have been produced in recent years its a terrible shame however that this surge in quality has led the majority of danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism in fact it has become so bad that i no longer trust any reviews of danish movies and as a result i have stopped watching them in theatersi know its wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie so let me stress that villa paranoia would be a terrible film under any circumstances the fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with danish film furthermore waiting until it came out on dvd was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money erik clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in copenhagen settings i particularly enjoyed de frigjorte 1993 as an actor he is usually funny though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies namely that of a working-class slob whos down on his luck partly because hes a slob but mostly because of society and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community this is problem number one in villa paranoia; clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible it is much worse however that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on for instance the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work after that the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge this is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters and clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is: telling instead of showing thus at one point you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels because the script wouldnt allow him to act out his feelings; and later on voice-over is abruptly introduced quite possibly as an afterthought to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the directors ineptitude fortunately at this point youre roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters let alone the so-called storythe acting which has frequently been a problem in clausens movies can be summed up in one sad statement: søren westerberg bentsen whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on big brother is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the casti give this a 2-out-of-10 rating
i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking what a false world this iswhat do you do when your most loved ones deceive you its said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance same way some people are such that they are never grateful this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster the surviving brother decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyoneamitabh gave the performance of his life the new actor aryan gave a good performance the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herselfa great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movies always give some message to the audience his movies are like novels of nanak singh a punjabi novelist whos novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil because they have a real message for the audience they are entertaining as well as lesson-giving
this service comedy for which peter marshall joanne drus brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares and tommy noonan were hyped as the new lewis and martin is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- theres one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; theyre about five feet apart noonan is throwing them in between and the total reaction is that everyone flinchesin the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar there are a few moments of brightness: marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pairit isnt enough to save this turkey alas
i have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes i still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the story-telling i am still a fanwith some minor painsthough this installment into the gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series had-a stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everythingsound familiar i have to say that this one gets a bit too mellow-dramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need to belly-ache about every thing that happens and what they need to do to stop the oz group from succeeding in their plansespecially the character called wufeii mean he whines more than an american character on a soap opera get a counselorwill yabesides for the over-exaggerated dramai think that mostly comes from the dubbing of the english voice actors this series is still very exciting and will still captivate me once again i mean it can always be worse it could be like the recent installment seedeeeewwww talk about mellow-dramaticill chat about that one later
what a terrible filmit starts well with the title sequence but thats about as good as it getsthe movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isnt so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isnt even scary despite the atmospheric musicit really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good filmit isnt a good film its trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it! one out of ten
i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula 2000 dracula 2000 was innovative fresh and well written if poorly actedthis pile cant even claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000 then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but craven chose to go in the style of his older films having no good tie but the main villains nameeven the actor playing dracula was different going from dark hair in dracula 2000 to a blonde hereavoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies
i liked this film a lot its dark its not a bullet-dodging car-chasing numb your brain action movie a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions its nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own mindsin the end motivated by love or vengeance or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is right will god ever forgive us for what weve done - its not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do what hes good at what hes been trained to dodenzel washington is a great actor - i honestly cant think of one bad movie hes done - and hes got a great supporting cast i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone
this is a cgi animated film based upon a french 2d animated series the series ran briefly on cartoon network but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people i know going huh this is the story of lian-chu the kind heart muscle and gwizdo the brains of the operation who along with hector their fire farting dragonhes more like a dog travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid into their lives comes zoe the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind it seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater zoe of course tags alongwhat can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar contender its a beautifully designed fantastic looking film the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures that constantly had me going wow at it the english voice cast with forrest whitaker as lian-chu one of the best vocal performances ive ever heard and rob paulson as gwizdo think steve bucsemi is first rate equally great is the script which doesnt talk down to its audience using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films not disney nor pixar its all really well doneis it perfect no some of the bits go on too long but at the same time its is damn entertainingif you get the chance see this its one of the better animated films from 2008 and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009
i really looked forward to this program for two reasons; i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters i dont like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level the world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a westland lynx several years ago the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah56a in the 1960s it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrustin short no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight and the bell 222 the actor that portrayed airwolf wasnt very fast even by helicopter standards and it didnt stay in production very longthere was a movie that came out during this time period called blue thunder that was much more realistic
with knightly and otool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or notthe number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements
this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a 3
former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz but proximity isn`t that kind of film it`s more like a man on the run film like the fugitive it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
i found time at the top an entertaining and stimulating experience the acting while not generally brilliant was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good as a film obviously aimed at the younger demographic it is certainly one of the better works in the genre childrens sci-fi normally i would say that canada the united kingdom and australia produce the best movies and tv shows for children and time at the top does nothing to discount this theory! i dont think that continuity and great acting are important to younger people a good plot and an imaginative screenplay are far more important to them both are in abundance in this film the special effects are good without detracting from the story or closing the viewers off from their own imaginations it would have been very easy to inject an over-load of sfx in this film but it would have totally destroyed its entire raison detre the settings and camera work are of a very high standard in this movie and complement the fine wardrobe and historical accuracy overall this film is highly satisfactory and i recommend it to all viewers who can see the world through childrens eyes or those that try to like myself! now i really must read the original book as soon as possible
ira levins deathtrap is one of those mystery films in the tradition of sleuth that would be very easy to spoil given any real examination of the plot of the film therefore i will be brief in saying it concerns a play one man who is a famous mystery playwright another man who is a promising writer the playwrights wife who is much younger and sexier than the role should have been and one german psychic along for the ride director sidney lumet no stranger to film is quite good for the most part in creating the tension the film needs to motor on the dialog is quick fresh and witty michael caine excels in roles like these christopher reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him act irene worth stands out as the funny psychic how about dyan cannon love how lumet packaged her posterior in those real tight-fitting pants and had her wear possibly the snuggest tops around but she is terribly miscast in this role - a role which should have been given to an older actress and one certainly less seductive but why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now deathtrap is funny sophisticated witty and classy the mystery has some glaring flaws which do detract somewhat and i was not wholly satisfied with the ending but watching caine and reeve under lumets direction with levins elevated verbiage was enough to ensnare my interest and keep it captive the entire length of the film
isabel allendes magical lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic south american family was vandalized the lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted--largely due to a magnificent cast of anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive latin mellifluousness of allendes characters and a plodding scandinavian directorial hand--was so uncomfortable in its own skin that i returned to the theater a second time to make certain i had not missed something vital that might change my opinion to my disappointment i had not missed a thing none among meryl streep jeremy irons glenn close and vanessa redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director bille august all of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned as if by putting forth as little effort as possible they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets yes the film was art directed within an inch of its life curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing kfc products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970--years before kfc came into being back then it was known by its original name: kentucky fried chicken even pardoning that what on earth is kentucky fried chicken doing in a military dictatorship in south america in 1970 american fast food chains did not hit south america until the early 1980s the house of the spirits should have been the motion picture event of 1993 because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented miramax had to market it as an art film as a result it was neither event nor art and for that isabel allende should have pressed charges for rape
a found tape about 3 guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman waysyeah spoilerfirst of all the acting made this short not scary at all the woman seemed to have orgasms not suffering some of the punishments were so ridiculous! whats shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair if you are shooting a nonsense tape at least make it good the only part to remark is the end: the hammered hand and the pierced eye the rest of the film is really poor to end the boredom the supposed story about the tape being investigated extra bullshit
99999% pure crap and the other 001% was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe nopethe dialogue was legendarily bad the action sucked and there was no sex the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst ive ever seen on film and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis the only names in this movie and marina sirtis looked really really badive seen high school plays more capably produced this is the kind of movie that mst3k thrived on heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air
san francisco is a big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didnt even manage the most basic of realistic details so i would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh ive been there you will be thinking how did a two story firetrapstinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competentthe stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminariesthe white boy intro was pointless i think the filmmakers didnt know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at a berkeley liberal - really folks everyone knows its not groovy to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting; this was notthe hunters point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco youve seen it done before and youve seen it done better even the video game was better! despite the generic non-locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong handsps there is a missing minority here see if you can guess which one
i was pretty young when this came out in the us but i recorded it from tv and watched it over and over again until i had the whole thing memorized to this day i still catch myself quoting it the show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters from frank sinatra to sylvester stallone to mr t the voices were great and sounded just like the characters they were portraying the puppets were also well done although a little creepy i was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by rob grant and doug naylor of red dwarf a show that i also enjoy very much like another person had written in a comment earlier i too was robbed of this great show by a friend who borrowed it and never returned it i sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a dvd release but i dont think enough people have heard of it oh well maybe ill try e-bay

oscar wildes comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second-rate cast sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy -- doubtless the hays office insisted premingers direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs erlynne; or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version
i dont like grade inflation but i just had to give this a 10 i cant think of anything i didnt like about it i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it im sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about with j lo and richard gear will be excellent but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought-provoking for me that i am hard-pressed to think of any way that it could be improved or its setting changed to a different culturea story i found worth watching and with o fist-fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort! imagine that!all the characters seemed well-developed even non-primary characters had good character-development and enjoyable acting and the casting seemed very appropriate its always hard to find a good movie-musical in our day and age and perhaps this doesnt quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance but no singing but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man successful with a family in japan looking for something he knows not precisely whatto the team of people in japan who contributed to this film thank you for creating and doing it
in a wordamazingi initially was not too keen to watch pinjar since i thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards india and pakistan i was so totally wrong pinjar is a heart-wrenching emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws i was haunted by it after watching it it lingered on my mind for so long; the themes the pain the loss the emotion- all was so realthis is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowadays it has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil pakistanis and good indians and pakistanis the cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious meaningful thanks to gulzar sahib and haunting everything about the movie was amazingand the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly castif you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movielook no further this movie gives it all i recommend it with all my heart amazing cannot describe how excellent it is
unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original nicholas cage fairly wooden as far as actors go imbues the screen with a range of skill from non-plussed to over the top the supporting cast is no betterthe plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold it turns out its just a bill of poor goods disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a befit of a doubt be given the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and whomever scouted the location should be commendedthere was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos literally at the enddisappointed! wait for the original to come on television pour a whiskey and enjoy
if you like cars you will love this film!there are some superb actors in the film especially vinnie jones with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearancethe others are not bad eitherthere are only two slight flaws to this film firstly the poor plot however people dont watch this film for the plot secondly the glorification of grand theft auto car crime however if people really believe they can steal a ferrari and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jail!when i first read that nicolas cage was to act the main role i first thought sweeet but then i thought naaaa you suck! but then finally after watching the film i realised yep he sucks!only joking he plays the role very wellill end this unusual review by saying if the premature demise of a criminal has in some way enlightened the general cinema going audience as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life and inspired them to change their ways then this death carries with it an inherent nobility and a supreme glory we should all be so fortunate you can say poor criminal i say: poor usps - angelina jolie voight looks quite nice!

the invisible boy kel mitchell who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; the spleen paul reubens granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused sphinx wes studi who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wisethis film really is a cross-genre romp anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle this is a spoofparody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly and occasionally decorated with more spoof material to the ridiculous costumes the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up but at the same time it is a serious superhero flick as well both at once while not a necessarily unique idea in itself for example this movie is in some ways reflective of dc comics short-lived inferior five work it is fairly innovative for the big screen it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know if superheroes were real so would these guys be real if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city youd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis sure the shoveller fights pretty well and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world but does that make them genuine super-heroes only in their mindsthis movie is also a comedy albeit a dark one inevitable when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ballfather yet it isnt a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes it mixes in a dose of drama of discovery and of romance but never really ventures fully into any of itwhat really makes mystery men a good film in the end is that it is very engaging the weaklame good guys are eventually justified and for one shining moment really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise if the viewer stops trying to label the film then the film can be a great rompof course no movie is perfect claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr furious love interest in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr heller although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys a point of which is made in the film the cinematography is choppy and disjointed such as happens in the average comic book so it is excusable the music sometimes overpowers the scenery and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very wellyet overall this film is incredible you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie but its a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest810 in my opinion
this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you! a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time*spoiler!!! spoiler alert!! spoiler!!*the main character is taken by her young handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back togetherin my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted

i saw this last week after picking up the dvd cheap i had wanted to see it for ages finding the plot outline very intriguing so my disappointment was great to say the least i thought the lead actor was very flat this kind of part required a performance like johny depps in the ninth gate of which this is almost a complete rip-off but i guess tv budgets dont always stretch to this kind of acting abilityi also the thought the direction was confused and dull serving only to remind me that carpenter hasnt done a decent movie since in the mouth of madness as for the story - well i was disappointed there as well! there was no way it could meet my expectation i guess but i thought the payoff and explanation was poor and the way he finally got the film anti-climactic to say the leastthis was written by one of the main contributors to aicn and you can tell he does love his cinema but i would have liked a better result from such a good initial premisei took the dvd back to the store the same day!

although she is little known today deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much-admired operatic singing voice this 1937 was her first major film and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered universal studiosthree smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry--with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother although the story is slight the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality and such enjoyable character actors as charles winninger alice brady lucile watson and mischa auer round out the cast a an ultra-light amusement for fans of 1930s filmgary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer
beside the fact that in all its awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in its best! paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it as usual a woman concieling her true intentions the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older brotherthe scenes in wiking land are just as i remember it from my early time travels - to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collectioni recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree hill-odin-
darius goes west is a film depicting american belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough this wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected but longed to see what was outside the confines of his lovely city of athens ga darius wished to see the ocean his longtime friends logan ben and several other good friends decided to make darius wish come true they started small - ben & logans mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to darius condition: duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great united states to say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement they realized darius dream and then some they put their lives on hold while showing love care and tons of fun to darius while helping darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from dmd darius went on to volunteer for the red cross - sitting in his chair collecting money along with his buddies outside a local grocery store his wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you give darius and all the guys an oscar - no one else deserves it more martha sweeney

of the many problems with this film the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on vhs for a college cable channel many years ago i tried to figure out what exactly went wrong what seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing how much longer to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriouslythats staggering; what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here their previous film white zombie was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films the mummy dracula etc and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazinesrevolt of the zombies to the contrary appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening and the change of dean jaggers character into a megalomaniac but it also explains why the zombies dont actually do much in the film besides stand around look frightening and wait for orders - theyre just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals weve all come to love and loathe in zombie filmsi am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but i think a film ought to be entertaining first and only later maybe educational and definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombiestruly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history but not one i can recommend even for historic value
after dipping his toes in the giallo pool with the masterful film the strange vice of mrs wardh 1971 director sergio martino followed up that same year with what turns out to be another twisty suspense thriller the case of the scorpions tail like his earlier effort this one stars handsome macho dude george hilton who would go on to star in martinos satanicgiallo hybrid all the colors of the dark the following year scorpions tail also features the actors luigi pistilli and anita strindberg who would go on to portray an unhappy couple to put it mildly! in martinos your vice is a locked room and only i have the key 1972 i just love that title! i suppose edwige fenech was busy the month they shot this! anyway this film boasts the stylish direction that martino fans would expect as well as a twisty plot some finely done murder set pieces and beautiful athenian location shooting the story this time concerns an insurance investigator hilton and a journalist strindberg here looking like farrah fawcetts prettier smarter sister who become embroiled in a series of grisly murders following a plane crash and the inheritance of $1 million by a beautiful widow i really thought i had this picture figured out halfway through but i was dead wrong although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo i may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties highlights of the picture for me were anitas cat-and-mouse struggle with the killer at the end a particularly suspenseful house break-in and a nifty fight atop a tiled roof; lots of good action bursts in this movie! the fine folks at no shame are to be thanked for still another great-looking dvd with nice subtitling and interesting extras whotta great outfit its turned out to be in its ongoing quest to bring these lost italian gems back from oblivion
this movie was horrible i swear they didnt even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie ice-t was annoying as hell *spoilers phht more like reasons not to watch it* they sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes he coulda been long gone the ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs and when ice-t is on that hill and uses that spaz-15 assault shotgun like its a sniper rifle and then cuts down a tree with eight shells it would take 1000s of shells to cut down a tree that size shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards and they even saw the reflection what reflected the light i didnt see a scope on that thing also when he got shot in the gut and kept going that was retarded he would of bled to death right there plusthe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel it wouldnt blow up and kill him the bullet would still fire kill ice t but mess up the barrel
i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness the film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the us into the war paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family hes a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture bette davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop runningthe problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems while this had a very noble goal at the time it just seems phony today in particular the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didnt ring true it sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children they were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off at times as a brat about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them though he had no discernible accentits really tough to believe that the ultra-famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog as it just doesnt sound true to life the story was based on the play by his lover lillian hellman and the basic story idea and plot is goodbut the dialog is just bad at times overall an interesting curio and a film with some excellent momentsbut thats really about all
after repeated listenings to the cd soundtrack i knew i wanted this film got it for christmas and i was amazed marc bolan had such charisma i cant describe it id heard about him in that way but didnt understand what people were talking about until i was in the company of this footage he was incredible clips from the wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as marc bolan performs some acoustic versions of get it on etc im still learning the song titles george claydon the diminutive photographer from magical mystery tour plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors nothing i can say to describe it would spoil it even though i put the spoilers disclaimer on this review so you would just need to see this for yourselves it evades description yes i love the beatles and was curious about ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now i finally find out its been on dvd for 2 years but its finally in my home its an amazing viewing experience - even enthralling now the dvd comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user: theres two hidden extras on the born to boogie double dvd release 1from the menu on disc oneselect the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2on the extra scenes page goto scene 42 take 1 and keep pressing left 3when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star+1972 logo appears 4press enter 5from the main menu on disc twoselect the sound options 6on the sound options page goto the 9025 i think thats right option and keep pressing left 7when the cursor disappears keep pressing right until a star+home video logo appears 8press enter
first off if youre planning on watching this make sure to watch the uncut version although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship it makes a huge difference this film is about a young woman played by barbara stanwyck who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father when her father suddenly passes away she is able to go out into the world on her own after reading about nietzsches philosophies on life she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all overall baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen it is very obvious what is happening off camerai enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it especially with the films shock value i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts but i think that about most movies the first time is see them actually i think that almost all movies ive seen made from the early 30s had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didnt quite flow right this was probably just the craft of film-making wasnt quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30s film and i think youll see what i meanonce again im very glad i was able to watch the original cut; it really does make a big difference also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role
usually i love lesbian movies even when they are not very good im biased i guess! but this one is just the pits yes the scenery and the buildings are beautiful and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time annamarie alternates between sulking and getting highstonedpassing out on whatever drug or booze is handy and ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie at no time are we given any insight into why this is so or even why annamarie is so depressed and withdrawnif there had at least been some kind of closure in the potentially romantic we dont even know! relationship between the two there might have been some kind of satisfaction but although annamarie at one point asks ella why do you love me ella doesnt even acknowledge this its never really clear whether this is anything more than an ill-behaved lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight womaneven the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey which could have been lively and informative are instead flat tedious and mostly incomprehensiblethere is one good joke in the movie although im sure it was unintentional the women travel in a two-seat ford coupe with a middling sized trunk yet when they set up camp they have an enormous tent cots sleeping gear and even a table chair and typewriter! on top of that when they board a ferry we see piles of luggage presumably theirs presumably also carried in the little fords trunk! and through the entire film we never see one gas station or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert so where did they get fuelthere may not be too many lesbian films out there good or bad but there are plenty that are better than this and very few that are worse leave this one in the rack
this was a blind buy used dvd it totally killed a nice buzz i had going when i hit playits bubble-headed comedy but its um squalid the plot is zany! but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived i ultimately found it depressing to watchmaybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film i know i know the quotes on the box & the academy award nomination mean nothing
the seventh sign borrows a lot from rosemarys baby and the omen it actually blends the two storieseven its title recalls bergman s the seventh seal neverthelessit begins well enoughwith all the omens scattered on the whole earthand in parallel a -seemingly- distinct plot with moores husband trying to save a poor boy who killed his parents who were brother and sisterfrom death penaltythis timeboth christian and jewish religions are called to the rescue even the wandering jew is involvedwhich makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny have you ever been to sunday school but they taught me that god was love!the best scene imho is the short dialog between priest john heard -who does not seem to take things seriously too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid-back acting is priceless-and the young jewdemi moore probably registered the same desire as ex-husband bruce willis :saving the worldshe does not save the movie for all that
a neat race against time premise - a murdered john doe is found to have pneumonic plague so while the health authority and nopd battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts the murderers think the heat is because the victims infected cousin is holding out on them this movie is freely available from the internet archive and its well worth downloading a lot all of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail though to me it does look under-exposed even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then werent what they are there is also a plenty of location background noise which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene anyone there are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting though the final chase is worth hanging on for theres not much wrong with the lead actors either: jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific while widmark as he often did pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time somebody should remake this - no supernaturals no mysticism no special fx just a good yarn full of character conflict and a topical theme another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy otoole and thats spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types peppering this dark sleazy against-the-clock drama theres even a midget newspaper sellercommunity what community dyou think youre living in the middle ages
honestly i dont know whats funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board masterpieces review had me in tears thats so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but its a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair!! good times ! this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless youre looking for a good laugh

if i had never read the book i would have said it was a good movie but i did read the book who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline there is so many changes that it wasnt really worthy of the title character changes plot changes time line changesfirst off who was henry and the investigator they werent in the story henry had mitchs persona somewhat but mitch wasnt a cop no you made it so roz helped sink his body and used that as zenias blackmail against roz the real so called blackmail was roz thought zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being gay from his mother her son wasnt even really mentioned in the story neither i dont believe was his lover rozs secretarytony and west were not together in the beginning he was actually with zenia first while in college the black painted apartment was their idea tony just went to visit this is where zenia and tony meet become fast friends tony hides her love for west then zenia left west with cash from tony then west and tony get together eventually marry at some point west leaves tony for zenia again for a short time only to be heart broken again then go back to tony zenias blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for zenia now being a professor at college she didnt want to let it get out i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfullycharis character was a blond not that it really matters zenia didnt trick her about having cancer while augusta was alive no she was there when charis had a lover named billy augustas father he was a draft dodger in the vietnam war eventually after charis takes care of zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal zenia and billy have an affair right under chariss nose while taking care of them both then zenia turns in billy to the government and leaves on the ferry with him not with augusta charis was pregnant with her tho charis also had a split personality karen was her real namezenia did not die from being cut up into pieces she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a fountain she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she odd she was also really dieing of cancer this time aroundit didnt show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader the book was striped down to its bare bones then re made in someone elses vision why couldnt you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie it was different enough and im sure could have been made more so
only the most ardent doris day fan could find this one even bearable to watch when one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about new york citys most famous blackout a film that could have dealt with numerous real-life stories of what people had to cope with this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story-telling originalityonce again doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her connecticut lodgings took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same wandering into the house by mistakenobody is able to salvage this mess--not doris not robert morse terry-thomas patrick oneal or lola albright as directed by hy averback its the weakest vehicle day found herself in committed to do the film because of her husbands machinations and unable to get out of it too bad
this one is just like the 6th movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one-liners are bad and are something that shouldnt be in a noes movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the 6th one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating 210
have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtzs character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesnt succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to havethe bottom line: obvious plot one-note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors
star pickford and director tourneur -- along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant clarence brown doing the editing -- bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor isolated scottish islanders -- the same territory that michael powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success visions of wind and wave sunbacked silhouettes of lovers do not merely complement the story they are the story of struggle against hardshipthe actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and pickford is brilliant as her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan wavering between comedy and thoughtfulness here with her fathers bullwhip lashing wayward islanders to church there seated with her guests walking stick in her hand like a scepter discussing her lover played by matt mooresee if you can pick out future star leatrice joy in the ensemble i tried but failed
bo derek will not go down in history as a great actress on the other hand starting in the 1980s actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in hollywood so bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of blake edwards 10 that is if she hadnt allowed her husband john derek to take over her career numerous playboy spreads and bad movies like this one this one in particular directed by john destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke in the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold john figured that putting bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps this version of tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of burroughs lord of the jungle a slap in the face to characters book and film legacy tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for bos breasts and richard harris wonderful over acting remember the pair had worked together in orca his scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes the film is quite boring nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance bos body can only get you so far miles okeeffe who played tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable b movie career and richard harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs but bo and john derek never recovered from this fiasco and future collaborations between the two only served to show why his directing career and her acting career died in the first placeand how did the orangutan get to africa
the selection of sylvester stallone to perform the protagonist by renny harlin is commendable since stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of rocky balbao and rambo but to compare die hard series with cliffhanger is a far-fetched notionthe excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws the heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed beforethe biting cold of the snow capped alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation the forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the endgood movies are not made every year and people dont get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then apart from the filthy languageparlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years
i had a video of the thing and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep its slow-moving and the idea of a mid-atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony apart from conrad veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting when the water started to spill big-time it even on one occasion woke me upbut give the man his due no one could hold a cigarette like conrad veidt he doesnt wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals he holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearly-browns there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark backgroundand looks very artistically done but it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke
the morbid catholic writer gerard reve jeroen krabbé that is homosexual alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of vlissingen while in the railway station in amsterdam he feels a non-corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician christine halsslag renée soutendijk who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop sphinx and they have one night stand on the next morning gerard sees the picture of christines boyfriend herman thom hoffman and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together but with the secret intention of seducing the man christine travels to köln to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house he drinks whiskey and snoops her safe finding three film reels with names of men; he decides to watch the footages and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband the ambiguous the vierde man is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs; magnificent performance of jeroen krabbé in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer; and stunning cinematography the inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films; however paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism last but not the least; the androgynous beauty of the sexy renée soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer my vote is eighttitle brazil: o 4o homem the 4th man
im watching the series again now that its out on dvd yay! its striking me as fresh as relevant and as intriguing as when it first airedthe central performances are gripping the scripts are layeredill stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show thatll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035ive been asked to write some more line it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever! pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb waywell unlike imdbs submissions editors american gothic understands that simplicity is everythingin 22 episodes the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situationwhen the show first aired i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off personally im starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years reckon it dont get more controversial than that!
yeah madsens character - whilst talking to the woman from the tv station - is right: the lapd is a corrupt violent and racist police and this movie changes nothing about it okay here are the good cops the moral cops even a black one whow a christian a martyr but this is a fairy tale admit it reality is not like that and most important for the action fans: the shoot out is boring its just shooting and shooting and shooting nothing more play counter strike then you will at least have something to do the only moral of this film is: the lapd is good now no more bad cops in it if you like uncritical euphemistic commercials for police and military service watch this movie its the longest commercial ive ever seen 2 points for camera and editing
three stooges - have rocket will travel - 1959 this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze from 1963 look like a masterpiecethe stooges are janitors at a rocket place they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call uni which they bring back to earth with them uni speaks like an average pleasant person - oh hello how are you lovely planet here hope you like it hilariousvery few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and onthe stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost overhigh point of the film - the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies brutalanother writer mentioned the fine musical score huh the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes - ill take romance and there goes that song again both of which are played at the party and *that* really is the high point of the picture - music from old columbia filmsthe tall sexy blonde was niceawful - a brand new vhs video from the 99 cents only store
this typical mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man joe mantegna good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist lindsay crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of mamets films steven goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didnt become a more noted player than she has become perhaps im not looking in the right places!the movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending youd expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie!
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the imdbcom movie database after seeing this film you may think duvalls appearance is reincarnation at its best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all too-true-to-life especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
i can see why laurel and hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle re-enactment but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic l & h bronson pinchot and gailard sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and theres a reasonably good supporting cast i enjoyed it
if one sits down to watch unhinged it is probably because its advertisements video boxes whatever scream that it was banned in the uk for over 20 years as virtually every video nasty does its true; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy being an exploitation fan however none of this was new to me the advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the uk dont necessarily make me want to watch it; in fact the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid british censors are how i came to viewing this then is simple: it promised gore and it was only $699 the price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts i did force myself however to watch it all in one sitting because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it so anyway after 90 minutes of unhinged i found that i had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence i think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing techniquethe layout of unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s theres unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore thats about it anyway it starts with a group of three attractive co-eds crashing their car on the way to a concert though two of them terry and nancy are okay one gloria is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion that happens to have no phone of course with rather strange occupants: marion is a middle-aged woman with a man-hating mother who constantly accuses marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them echoes of psycho she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods because her mothers hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house after hanging with marion for awhile terry our hero and nancy decide they must contact their parents despite everyones warnings nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone her fate is not hard to predict after that we see gloria again who is then promptly butchered with an ax when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room she decides something isnt right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends that may be easier said than done however with crazy carl lurking around after viewing unhinged i read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end normally i do not drag other peoples opinions into my reviews especially when they contradict my views but in this case i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention this is because in actuality the film crawls normally for the slow-building tactic to work the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger oh sure we see two of them get murdered but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom we are aware that theres a killer on the loose but this is only focused on three times in the film; that means theres no reason to fear for the victims instead the films events are explained not by the actions of the characters but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking if theres one thing i can assure you from watching this its that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious none of this is helped by the atrocious acting it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experienceof course id be a liar if i said there wasnt one part of the movie that i enjoyed specifically the ending was one of the best ive ever seen in a slasher film; you just do not expect that to happen just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular ah i wont spoil it for you nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow-moving film but it definitely will get your attention other than that the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material but its not like you couldnt tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed however; those are the only scenes of gore present that and of course no one scene can save an entire movie i normally preach the doctrine that as long as theres action the worse a movie is the better it gets unhinged only grasps one part of this concept the whole film just feels luke-warm; theres potential alright but the director either wasnt experienced enough to make it work or just didnt know what the hell he was doing
here comes the romeo division to change the paradigmlet me just say that i was blown away by this short film i saw it randomly when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since i really truly believe i was part of a happening like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streetsi am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but i so hope i can be there for itagain a truly incredible piece of film making
it is no wonder this movie won 4 prices it is a movie that lingers to any soul it isnt a wonder why it took paul reiser 20 years to finally give in and talk to peter falk about his idea i can understand every part of it this is a movie that will make you cry just a tear or thousandsstory: 1010 when sam kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her leaving him to find something else his son and him take out on a road trip to find her and while they do that they find something lost friendship family and affection for each other at the beginning you know whats going to happen but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end it is a ride between a father and his son and a husband and his wife it is no wonder it took paul reiser 20 years to write this beautiful romancecomedyactors: 1010 well you cant say anything else that what i about to say hey it is with peter falk in it he is a legend everything he does in movies are magic when you use peter falk in a romancecomedy what do you think you get a perfect outcome it is no wonder this movie is that perfect and won that many prices as the son paul reiser does an excellent job although he isnt a great actor always that doesnt mean that this didnt work actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son the rest of the cast is good enough but you dont see them as much so just say they do what they shall to get this to shine even more music: 1010 it doesnt always work when using music sometimes it just doesnt fit but that is not the thing in this movie the music is perfect in tune it makes the movie even more compelling this part of the movie will shine off as good as the other parts a great soundtrack for a romancecomedy thats for sureoverall: 1010 there are so many romancecomedy movies out on tapes dvds blu-ray and what not but this movie is one of the special ones it doesnt happen everyday that you can create a story like this it takes years thinking about this and the fact is that actually what it took to make it a great piece that should be bought and kept into the human soul see it when you get old and see it with your father at a old age i think then this movie will spark like no other ever made
although it has been remade several times this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time creative dialog unique genius in the final scene it deserves more credit than critics have given it highly recommended one of the best comedies of recent years
scarecrows seems to be a botched horror meets supernatural film a group of thugs pull off a paramilitary-like robbery of the payroll at camp pendleton in california they high-jack a cargo plane kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with demands to be flown to mexico along the way one greedy robber decides to bailout with the money landing in a cornfield monitored by strange looking scarecrows these arent just any run-of-the-mill scarecrowsthey can kill the acting is no better than the horrible dialog and the attempts at humor are not funny very low budget and shot entirely in the darkthe cast includes: ted vernon michael david simms kristina sanborn bj turner phil zenderland and victoria christian
loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can i say it was a total mess! the directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast-forward-slow mo nonsense it was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb mtv marilyn mansonsmashing pumpkinsplacebo music video whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the japanese girl was hilarious and ted raimis death was just stupidly funny it just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more no explanations were given whatsoever i mean i knew what was happening only as id read the story but for people who hadnt its even more confusing as at times even i didnt know where it was going and what it was trying to do- it was going on an insane tangent the whole timegod i really wanted to like this film as im a huge fan of barkers work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie hell i even enjoyed some of kitamuras movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish- i didnt care about anyone or anything the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source turning it into something else entirely granted it was gory and vinnie jones played a superb badass but everything else was all over the place more than disappointing gutted
okay ive always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imagined--i was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesnt even begin to compare with the original series its like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker whoin my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much moredo not waste your time on this show or your money
men of honor stars cuba gooding jr as real life navy diver carl brashear who defied a mans navy to become the first african american navy diver sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who carl brashear really admired his name was master chief billy sunday robert deniro sunday in a lot of ways pushed aggravated and helped carl become the man he wanted to be i loved cuba in this film his portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as denzel washington was in the hurricane through every scene we can see his passion motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream we can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud i also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes brashears encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart-stopping and brilliant the only fault i could see would have to lie in the supporting cast cuba and deniros characters are very intricate and exciting to watch which does make you a little sad when they have to butt heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters the evil lt cmdr hanks sundays wife charlize theron the eccentric diving school colonel hal holbrook and cubas love interest are the characters i found to not have very much depth what could have made these characters more substantial and more effective was a little more time to develop them why was that colonel always in his tower how come sundays wife was so bitter and always drunkanother curious question has to be this what happened to carl brashears wedding i mean if this film is chronicling this mans life wouldnt his wedding be an important event maybe its just me men of honor however is a perfect example of the triumph and faith that the human spirit envelops this film will inspire and make you feel for this mans struggle which i do believe was the reason this powerful story was told my hat goes off to you carl brashear i really admire your strength
there is so much that can be said about this film it is not your typical nunsploitation of course there is nudity and sex with nuns but that is almost incidental to the storyit is set in 15th century italy at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards that the mother superior would ask why do you fear the muslims; they will not do anything that the christians have done to you certainly there was enough torture on both sidessister flavia florinda bolkan is sent to a convent for defying her father in the process she witnesses and endures many things: the gelding of a stallion the rape of a local woman by a new duke the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun and her nipples cut offsister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives she even asks jesus why the father son and holy ghost are all meneventually she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time but tragedy is to come she manages to exact sweet revenge on all including the duke and her father but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same she is a woman and that is all there is to iti wont describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decadesnunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest
if this film had a budget of 20 million id just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play-station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975-83 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made! i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely! i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar im betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films! i want my money back!
i was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of tigerland it was a liberals fantasy of how the military should be the dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things colin farrells character was allowed to get away with by his superior officersi kept thinking hey theres a reason why boot camp is tough its supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit theres no room for cocky attitudes and men who wont follow orders i was rooting for bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers i would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with peoples feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit--
my child my sister dream how sweet all things would seem were we in that kind land to live together and there love slow and long there love and die among those scenes that image you that sumptuous weathercharles baudelaire based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim enachanted april can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that enchanted april - an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre lovely and sunny tender and peaceful kind and magical it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever this is the movie that actually affected my life i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost unhappy and very lonely when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible i had promised to myself then that no matter what i would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and i would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadnessi promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alonecharming enchanting and heartwarming enchanted april is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love this little film is a diamond of highest quality
i vaugely recall seeing this when i was 3 years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon then i was about 8 or 9 years old when i rediscovered it and since i was then able to comprehend things better i thought it was a good movie then fast forward to just a few weeks ago june 2006 when i re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articlesvideo clips and its just not the same movie im sure its still good with the kids but to us 20-30 somethings its definitely got cult status written all over it its a shame that the original production went through a painful process; if fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be but thats for fox to decide im rambling here i know i still think its a great film but it could be better than great
pretty awful but watchable and entertaining its the same old story if youve lived through the 80s vietnam vets fight together as buddies against injustice back in the states a-team meets death wish my favorite!time goes on the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble no wait -- in fact the friend is dead and it is his dad thats in trouble our first hero joey is killed by an exceedingly horrifying super pointy meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his fathers small store from the local protection gang despite being wheelchair bound from the war desperate for help the father talks to sarge the leader of joeys old unit from vietnam when sarge shows up for the funeralwell the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the old gang saddles up for the city you can pretty much imagine most of the rest of the moviethe one thing that drove me crazy is that sarge keeps haranguing his men about planning and about how theyre really good at what they do when they plan ahead but joey wouldnt have been put in a wheelchair by a gunshot in vietnam in the first place if the unit hadnt been messing around! then when things are going really well in the city as they battle the gangs they do it again for no reason at all they completely bypass their plan and try to nail the gang without everyone being present phh!!!! i raise my hands in disgust foolishness!there is also a suspicious moment when all present members of the unit make sure to try out the heroin they snatch from the gang to make sure its real every single one of them hmmwhat are you going to do keep watching i guess the movie isnt too horrible to watch but it is a tease there are all these climactic moments when nothing actually winds up happening the most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the movie -- the explosives in vietnam joeys death battle and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside poor teddy!i guess my main beef with this movie is that i feel let down by it even the confusing subplots with mystery helpers and their bizarrely cross-purpose motives wasnt enough to save it at the end but someday maybe itll all come right and theyll make a sequel ha ha ha ha!!!
im working for a sinister corporation doing industrial espionage in the future and im starting to get confused about who i really am sh*#t! ive got a headache and things are going wobbly oh no here comes another near subliminal fast-cut noisy montage of significant yet cryptic imagesi rented this movie because the few reviews out there have all been favourable why cypher is a cheap derivative dull movie set in a poorly realised bland futureworld with wooden leads and a laughable endingan eerie sense that something interesting might be about to happen keeps you watching a series of increasingly silly and unconvincing events before the film makers slap you in the face with an ending that combines the worst of bond with a duran duran videoits painfully obvious they have eked out the production using dr who style improvised special effects in order to include a few good if a little babylon 5 cgi set pieces this sub fight club sub philip k dick future noir thriller strives for a much broader scope than its modest budget will allowcool blue moodiness served up with po-faced seriousness - disappointingly dumb this is not intelligent sci-fi this is the plot of a computer game
problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade! this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents but he gets into trouble later that junior can drive grandpas car he can scare people with a bear he can put a room on fire! it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth a sequel is an even worse fate rent chicken run instead*12 out of **** i give it
this is a story about shin-ae who moves to milyang from seoul with her young son jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband her husband was born here and she is opening up a piano school but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death if that is what the film was about it probably would have been like a hollywood film with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home but this is not hollywood her son gets kidnapped and murdered ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement the grief process attempts at moving on attempts to clear her conscience of guilt are all done admirably and the lead actress is superb the only caveat and it has to be stated is that this is a depressing film you have to know that going in you want shin-ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness again this is not hollywood it is korea and in korean cinema especially drama they pull no punches life is what happens to you great acting but sometimes a tough film to watch due to the goings on if you stay youll be rewarded do that

a truly unpleasant film while rick bakers special effects are quite impressive if stomach-turning it has no other redeeming features like many 70s movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense
good folks i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers my academic specialty is anglo-saxon literature and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves the icelandic beowulf and grendel is the least offensive i have seen and i did pay $300 for my copy this sci-fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version yuckwhat didnt i like cgi for one amazingly bad more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting i am used to both with all the versions i have seendelighted regardless peter

first of all yes animals have emotions if you didnt know that already then i believe you are a moron but lets assume that none of us are morons we all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature correctwhat we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human the filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour and when it happens they say that monkey is almost human! thats actually a direct quoteeverything is in human terms they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs smile but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hati had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages but instead researchers keep falling back on pedantic anthropomorphic observations and assumptions add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps celebrating christmas and this was enough to turn my stomachbut it doesnt end there half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language want out hurry goobscure references are made to stress tests and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a mother figure and after 40 years of experiments the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotionsone chimp named washoe has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose and to this day she remains thus we get a brief glimpse again through bars of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression personally i dont need to see any further experimental data washoe i apologize for our entire species

first things first edison chen did a fantastic believable job as a cambodian hit-man born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive living on the mantra of kill or be killed in a role that had little dialogue or at least a few lines in cambodianthai his performance is compelling probably what should have been in the jet li vehicle danny the dog where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting and on someone elses leashlike danny the dog the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically but rather designed as normal brutal fisticuffs where everything goes this probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each others throats in defending their own lives while taking it away from others its a grim gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller productionedison plays a hired gun from cambodia who becomes a fugitive in hong kong on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry leading the chase is the team led by cheung siu-fai who has to contend with maverick member inspector ti sam lee whos inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father so begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of hong kongthe story itself works on multiple levels especially in the character studies of the hit-man and the cop on opposite sides of the law we see within each character not the black and white but the shades of grey with the hit-man we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl pei pei bringing about a sense of maturity tenderness and revealing a heart of gold the cop with questionable tactics and attitudes makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done there are many interesting moments of moral questioning on how anti-hero despicable strategies are adopted youll ask what makes a man and what makes a beast and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us transforming from man to dog and dog to man dog bite dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag especially on its tender moments and it suffered too from not knowing when to end if i should pick a favourite scene then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered a suspenseful edge of your seat moment listen out for the musical score too and youre not dreaming if you hear growls of dogshighly recommended especially if you think that youve seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre
this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different that makes this columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old columbo i liked it a lot but then i like almost any columbo
i caught this on the dish last night i liked the movie i traveled to russia 3 different times adopting our 2 kids i cant put my finger on exactly why i liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi-bad i liked the look ben chaplin has through the whole movie like i cant belive this is happening to me whether its good or bad it the same look and it works great ending 710 rent it or catch it on the dish like i did
the book is fantastic this film is not there is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book hell total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world the bleak german expressionistic colours the black and white footage from the vision screens there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984 the main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage this film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design atmosphere and theme yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist worship-the-humble-worker theme itself this book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before i could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap the soundtrack is annoying the lack of foresight is annoying this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novels messages to the viewer
the second renaissance part 1 lets us show how the machines first revolted against the humans it all starts of with a single case in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they wantalthough an interesting premise the story gets really silly from then on with violent! riots between the robots and mankind somehow it doesnt seem right as another reviewer points it its all a little too cleverthe animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix in particular osiris work for the best as for second renaissance part 1 id say its too violent and too silly 410

the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain or at least is an alan quartermain type of character that the 85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there it was labeled by many critics to have been a great parody or unintentional comedy unintentional is the word this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty yes but not humorous unfortunately its witless rather than wittywith this new m4tv mini-series you get much more story character development of your lead solid portrayals and a fine even entertaining blend this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy while it features both action and eye candy it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq making for a fine well - thought - out plot and some nice complementing sub-plots now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones nor is it a poor attempt to be so this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aqksm saga filmed on location in south africa the audience is granted beautiful if desolate vistas sa aboriginal cultures and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline heresteve boyum totally surprised me with this one as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision in fact i have disliked most of his work as a director until this attempt i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be this version rates a 9810 on the tv scale fromthe fiend :
star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits some plutoniums gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction- so josh mccord chuck norris and his cocky young protégé deke judson mills a different actor from the previous film with the assistance of joshs adopted daughter que jennifer tung set out to stop themthis was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 911 filmed in 2001 norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown new york that day so thered have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his side-kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else other than that its as interchangeable as anything norris has ever been in it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place and whether if this one could get made a presidents man 3 might come out sometime soonif youve seen one norris film youve really seen them all and theres really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one but at least you know what youre getting and like i said it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam **
i was very disappointed by this movie i thought that scary movie although not a great movie was very good and funny scary movie 2 on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupidthe exorcistamityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie james woods was greatnow ill admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where i had basically seen them all but bad comedy is still bad comedysomething that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes scenes and jokes drag out way to longalso the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again for example the talking bird ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson chris elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tastelesssome jokes even got repeated from the first movie for example the creaming i guess you would call it of cindy anna faris was funny in scary movie because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he creamed her but this time around it was out of place and not funnythe bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second filmtori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this moviebut i did enjoy shorty marlon wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second filmdont get me wrong i love the wayans family and their humor that is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes
1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technologyshow people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then redeems himself by winning the football game the polo game etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general marmaduke oldfish pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio commissary the peppers run into billy boone william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job shes unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she perseveres eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the new-found fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesnt really love unless fate somehow intervenesone of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggys autograph an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesnt care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young 20 year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60s and early 70s despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon
this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget no effort no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video storeif you want to know what watching this movie is like grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and attacking people congratulations youve just made hood of the living dead! now see if a distribution company will buy it from youi have seen some low budget shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort but this has neither avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies
i gather at least a few people watched it on sept2 on tcm if you did you know that hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she came the us it was a huge scandal and i gather that the original release in the us was so chopped up by censors that it was practically unintelligible i watched because i had just seen a documentary on bad women actresses in the us pre- movie censorship board set up in the early 30s it looked to me as though they got away with a lot more than hedys most sensational shots in ecstasy in fact hedy looked positively innocent in this by todays standards and it was nice to see her early unspoiled beauty it was a nice lyrical movie to relax to i loved it for what it was: a simple romance i watched it after pre- recording it during a sleepless early am i would love to see the first version released in the us for comparisons sake
the first movie is pretty good this one is pretty badrecycles a lot of footage including the opening credits and end title from criminally insane the new footage shot on video really sticks out as poorly done scenes lack proper lighting the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible theres even video glitches like the picture rolling and so onlike all bad sequels it basically just repeats the story of the first one ethel kills everybody who shares her living space often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wantsat least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one which also includes the same directors film satans black wedding too bad it doesnt include the death nurse movies though
lhypothèse du tableau voléthe hypothesis of the stolen painting 1979 begins in the courtyard of an old three-story parisian apartment building inside we meet the collector an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure impressionist-era painter tonnerre a narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting and then engages in a dialogue with the collector who describes the paintings to us shows them to us tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down and then tells us hes going to show us somethingas he walks through a doorway we enter another world or worlds or perhaps to stretch to the limits other possible worlds the collector shows us through his apparently limitless house including a large yard full of trees with a hill; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life or half-way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting of the work as a whole of a whole secret history behind the paintings the scandal the people in the paintings the novel that may have inspired the paintings and so on and so on every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while the collector and the narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and differenti watched this a second time so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was and so challenging to think or write about if i have a guess as to what it all adds up to it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation an indicator might be found in two of the most amusing and inexplicable scenes are those in which the collector poses some sexless plastic figurines -- in the second of them he also looks at photos taken of the figurines that mirror the poses in the paintings -- then he strides through his collection which is now partially composed of life-size versions of the figures if we think too much about it and dont just enjoy it it all becomes just faceless plasticwhether ive come to any definite conclusions about lhypothèse du tableau volé or not i can say definitely that outside of the early and contemporaneous works of peter greenaway like a walk through h ive rarely been so enthralled by something so deep so serious so denseand at heart so mischievous and fun
how good is gwyneth paltrow! this is the right movie for her too bad shes completely out role i havent read the book by jane austen but i cant believe it is so superficial and the characters arent much more than caricatures it wasnt probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didnt overstep the mark of overacting a couple of times
full marks for the content of this film as a brit i was not aware that there was segregation in the us navy during wwii a very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world however the movie is pathetic direction is non existent the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another i can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together this could have been a great movie the story for many of us outside of the us was new unique and also interesting the sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together it is unfortunate that a true story like this which could have changed peoples attitudes has been squandered on a low budget badly directed movie i only hope that some time in the future one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice
what a great british movie a screaming good laugh and sexy gary stretch too and oh lots of bikes and lovely welsh countrysidemembers of our club the arrowhead bike and trike social club appear in it as extras! hooray!! there are some genuinely hilarious bits good acting a good ideamet the director jon ivay at a showing in wareham dorset a great man down to earth and a good laugh this film must be supported as all great brit movies should!so please go and see it if you can they have a website with cinemas that are showing it so find one near you!i cant wait to get the dvd some of our biker friends have seen the film two or three times already and cant get enough of itamanda
it even beats the nasty raw almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothesold schooland he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family he was only 22-years old then and this is a must-see!810
loc could have been a very well made movie on how the kargil war was fought; it had the locations the budget and the skill to have been indias saving private ryan or black hawk down instead it come across as a bloated 4 hour bore of trying to meld the war move with the masala movie even the war scenes were terribly executed using the same hill in all their battle scenes and spending unnecessary time on casual talk instead of trying to appeal to the indian public a better movie would have been a to-the-book account of what happened at kargil like black hawk down or even spending time on the militant point of view like tora tora tora even better it could have used a competent director like ram gopal verma to write direct and edit the film until then id like to see some one re-edit this film with only the pertinent portions included; it would make the movie more watchable
back when musicals werent showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this onebeing a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood but close enough some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with wodehouses british sense of humour but on the whole the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricaturessome inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number they seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realisticthe lack of ginger rogers and eric blore dont hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge its also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with wodehouses young aristocratic females
some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough well if you regard it as an action movie this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting however i think this is a psychological drama rather than an action onethe movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences tomas beccket who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills looked as if he was cold-hearted however after beccket showed his day dream of montana we can clearly see his softness inside it was the cruel war and his partners sacrifice that made beccket become so called cold-heartedmillar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper billy zane did quite well to show millars hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through ones heartas what beccket said what he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the awardthese two guys were quite different in their personalities and i think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities these two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the othersniper isnt a good action movie but a good psychological one
the movie celebrates lifethe world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the moviethe movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy music and jazzthis movie is very refreshing piece of visual poeticsthe watching experience is like youve been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough worldlike mr kusturica movie should be
flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick ive ever seenup to nowits a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest seagal isnt really trying in this - hes fat and his voice is dubbed once morethe co-stars fare no better being a rather sorry load of 3rd ratersthe direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that hes also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers shadow man & attack force the screenplay co-written by seagal himself is laughably ineptaccording to imdb $12m was spent on this boring load of old tosh - if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spentflight of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder - which has to be better than this tripethis has no redeeming qualities whatsoevergive it a miss! 12 * out of *****
oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japans ringu well i guess the us made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i cant believe this had to happen claudine and kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not have to stoop this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them!
last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made - capote and infamousi cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 a stark powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks elmer gantry cat on a hot tin roof the professional blackboard jungleit is interesting that robert blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this filmthis is a film that stays with you after viewing
what if somerset maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club if he had he could have called it the razors edge since the katha-upanishad tells us the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to salvation is hard but maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class and so we have darryl f zanucks version of larry darrell recently returned from wwi carefully groomed well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner or as maugham tells us this is the young man of whom i write he is not famous it may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature the razors edge has all of zanucks cultural taste that money could buy its so earnest so sincereso self-important as larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on merchant ships climbing a himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend isabel played by gene tierney his tragic childhood chum played by anne baxter the girlfriends snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by clifton webb and willie maugham himself played by herbert marshall taking notes the movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is clifton webb as elliot templeton if i live to be a hundred i shall never understand how any young man can come to paris without evening clothes webb has some good lines but we wind up appreciating clifton webb not elliot templeton zanuck wanted a prestige hit for twentieth century when he bought the rights to maughams novel he waited a year until tyrone power was released from military service he made sure there were well-dressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself the effort is as self-conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux despite hollywoods view of things in the razors edge i can tell you that for most people hard work doesnt bring enlightenment just weariness and low pay after nearly two-and-a-half hours we last see larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale hes going to work his way back to america from europe with a contented smile on his face my dear somerset maugham says to isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get i dont think anyone can fail to be better and nobler kinder for knowing him you see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the worldand hes got it! larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of dramamine maugham lest we forget was a fine writer of plays novels essays and short stories to see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in encore trio and quartet and instead of wasting time with larry darrell spend some time with lawrence durrell the alexandria quartet is a good read
i am a big-time horrorsci-fi fan regardless of budget but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video this has to be the worst of all movies with bloody special effects what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again and people running around screaming from left then to right then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead it is dragged out very long it is very very x5 low budget many scenes were way way too long narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos red zone cuba benjiand godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet avoid it like you would an undead brain-eating mob the why-did-i-ever-see-this-piece-of-zombie-dung-blues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etcad infinitum -infinity10
i have a 5 minute rule sometimes ill leave leway for 10 if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes its probably not going to ever get better i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory dan in real life is definitely no exception i was watching this turkey and thought; wow this is not funny not touching not sad and i dont like any of the characters at allthe story of an advice columnistwidower raising three young daughters who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend i suppose the tagline would be advice columnist who could use advice i dont know dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice i guess thats the irony i dont know he goes to see his parents brothers sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat which seems very sweet and potential fodder for good comedy story linesnone which ever emerge the central story is basically how he loves this woman but cant have her anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny trite lifetime movie network dialogue murderer of love to get to the inevitable happy endingthis is truly one of the worst movies ive ever seen
where to startoh yea message to the bad guys: when you first find the person you have been tracking in order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed dont spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim: when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away dont sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you cant have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away! time and motion doesnt work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesnt have to brutally kill 4 men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home
to me movies and acting is all about telling a story the story of david and bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan hayward were at their best to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel made this story all the more compelling you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life susan haywards fear reluctance but then obedience to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her one could also feel davids anguish the nigh that uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle raymond masseys powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel his anger the sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable all in all i think this was one of the best movies of its kind i gave it a rating of ten
there seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology which is extremely flawed it simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribejournalism 101: tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable for instance the idea of civil war chaos looting etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following husseins demise: were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of islam itself rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure would they rather the us have declared marshall law im sure the papers here wouldve exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist forceaside from the analytical idiocy of the film it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming so-and-so refused to be interviewed yet the questions they wouldve asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received would you as vice president deign to be interviewed by a first time writerproducer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words they couldnt roll tape of condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions perhaps they never watched her hearingthis is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there this is another biased asinine approach by journalists - which are by and large unthinking herdsanyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than nbc coverage and cnn commentary these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think
a battleship is sinking its survivors hanging onto a nearby liferaft sit there doing nothing while we go into each of their minds for a series of long flashbackseven though noel cowards name is the only one that you notice during the credits everything thats cinematic in it is because of lean and on technical terms its very good david lean just knew films from the get-go there are many moments where cowards studied dialogue takes a second seat and leans visual sense takes centre stage try the soldiers getting off the ship near the end and that whole scene; the tracking shot towards the hymn singing the scene where were inside a house that gets bombednoel coward is one of the worst actors ive ever seen hes totally wooden not displaying emotion character or humanity you can see it in his eyes that hes not really listening to what the other performer is saying hes just waiting for them to finish so he can rush out his own line710its episodic a bit repetitive and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: theres no central story that they advance just give general insights into the characters still its an interesting film worth a watch - and a good debut for lean its not a very deep or penetrating film and its definitely a propaganda film but its also a showcase for leans editing skills - its all about how the pieces are put together
as the first of the tv specials offered on the elaborate box set barbra streisand: the television specials released last november this disc is being released separately for those who do not want to fork over the dollars for all five specials as an investment this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is streisand at her purest and most eager to impress that she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend signed to a long-term contract with cbs to produce hour-long variety shows an almost extinct format nowadays streisand was all of 22 in this cbs special first broadcast in april 1965 at that point of her career her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums a few dazzling tv appearances on variety and talk shows and her successful broadway run in funny girlfilmed in crisp black-and-white the program is divided into three distinct parts with the creative transitional use of im late from disneys alice in wonderland the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as make believe and im five opening with a comic monologue about pearl from istanbul the second part moves on location to manhattans chic bergdorf goodmans where she is elegantly costumed in a series of glamorous outfits while singing depression-era songs like ive got plenty of nuthin and the best things in life are free with comic irony back to basics the third segment is a straight-ahead concert which opens with a torchy version of when the sun comes out includes a funny girl medley and ends with her classic melancholic take on happy days are here again over the ending credits also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on vhs for those who know streisand only for her pricey concert tickets and political fundraising this is a genuine eye-opener into why she is so revered now
the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes it gives the basic summary of what is going on this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is all you will learn about them the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie i have never played the video game but know people who have from my understanding whether youve played the game or not this movie does not get any better save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters
what a waste of time! ive tried to sit through sky captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes i start doing something else - anything else! its a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a first-time director because its stiff and i wanted to love it i love sci-fi the old cliffhangers and i can appreciate the attempt at nods to flash gordon and metropolis but my god what a waste of money i used to work for paramount pictures and i had written sherry lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests she told me theyd never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later paramount releases this piece of crap sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie lets not forget neither jude nor jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes paltrows performance reminds me of a high school effort too bad - it couldve worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is sky captains director will keep getting work even after this dreck its commerce not art!
i hadnt seen this film in probably 35 years so when i recently noticed that it was going to be on television cable again for the first time in a very long time it is not available on video i made sure i didnt miss it and unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again i found the visual images from the pride of the marines were as vivid and effective as i first remembered what makes this movie so special anywayeverything based on the true story of al schmid and his fellow marine machine gun crews ordeal at the battle of the tenaru river on guadalcanal in november 1942 the screenplay stays 95% true to the book upon which it was based al schmid marine by roger butterfield varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture this is not a typical war movie where the action is central and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film but it is a memorable 10 minutes filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre in a way probably ahead of its time the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark ugly brutal nature of battle and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war this film isnt about glorifying war; i cant imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and wanting to enlist in the service not right away anywaywhat this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle and how damaged men can learn to re-claim their lives theres an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this and i feel thats another reason why the film was so so well received--it was exceptionally well-written theres a dream sequence done in inverse negative film that seems almost experimental and the acting is strong too led by john garfield garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and schmids were nearly the same and garfield met schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role actors dont do that much anymore but added to the equation its just another reason why this movie succeeds in telling such a difficult unattractive story
i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story! add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great the trouble wasit wasnt i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this being bored to death jean arthurs character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasnt at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actorin a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one
for a no budget movie this thing rocks i dont know if americas gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really non-hollywoodthe actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo whooo!ive seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think ive seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked! luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
the british production company amicus is generally known as the specialist for horror anthologies and this great omnibus called the house that dripped blood is doubtlessly the finest amicus production ive seen so far admittedly there are quite a few that i have yet to see though the house that dripped blood consists of four delightfully macabre tales all set in the same eerie mansion these four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully gothic atmosphere and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable peter cushing christopher lee cushing and lee are two of my favorite actors ever as well as denholm elliott and the ravishing ingrid pitt star in this film - so which true horror fan could possibly afford to miss it no one of course and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast the house that dripped blood revolves around an eerie rural mansion in which strange things are happening in four parts the film tells the tales of four different heirsthe first tale method for murder tells the story of horror novelist charles hyller denholm elliott who moves into the house with his wife after moving in the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation the first segment is a great kickoff to the film the story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very goodin the second story waxworks retired businessman phillip grayson peter cushing moves into the house and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town the great peter cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this and the rest of the performances are also very good the tale is delightfully weird and the second-best of the film after the thirdthe third tale sweets to the sweet is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four john reed christopher lee moves in with his little daughter the private teacher and nanny mrs norton whom mr reed has employed to instruct his daughter is appalled about her employers strictness towards his daughter and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective fathers views on upbringing may have this best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot christopher lee is as always superb in his role nyree dawn porter is also very good as the nanny and my special praise goes to then 11-year-old chloe franks this ingenious segment alone makes the film a must-see for every true horror-fanin the fourth segment horror-actor paul henderson jon pertwee moves into the house with his sexy mistressco-star carla ingrid pitt this fourth story is satire more than it is actually horror it is a highly amusing satire however and there are many allusions to other horror films at one point henderson indirectly refers to christopher lee who stars in the previous third segmentall four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere as stated above the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous horror tales that every horror lover should appreciate an igenious atmosphere a macabre sense of humor genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must-see in short: the house that dripped blood is an excellent horror-omnibus that no lover of british horror could possibly afford to miss highly recommended!
if this is supposed to be a portrayal of the american serial killer it comes across as decidedly averagea journalist [duchovny] travels across country to california to document americas most famous murderers unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [pitt] is a serial killer himselfrather predictable throughout this has its moments of action and pitt and lewis portray their roles well but id not bother to see it again
nicolas mallet is a failure a teller in a bank everyone walks all over him then his friend a writer whos books no one likes has a plan to change his life our hero tells his boss he is quitting he intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women and he manages to do just thatif it were not for the amount of death murdersuicidenatural causes in the film this would be a farce there are numerous jabs at marriage politics journalism andlifejean-louis trintignant is a likable amoral rogue romy schneider is at her most appealing definitely worth a look
brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore-fests but the truth is that his films actually arent bad at all the re-animator sequels arent as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series; and society isnt a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece this thriller certainly isnt a masterpiece; but it shows yuznas eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging im really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didnt turn up until 1996 as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - its running away from a tiger for the modern world dentistry doesnt frighten me but surprisingly; i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want however his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wifes affair with the pool cleaner and his life isnt the only one; as its his patients who feel the full brunt of his angerwhen it comes to scaring the audience this movie really makes itself however credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that im not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline only with the dentist you always get the impression that theres more to the film than what were seeing it isnt very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this wont be winning any awards the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting while b-class is actually quite impressive; with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie the dawn of the dead star doesnt get enough work and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast doesnt massively impress but all do their jobs well enough overall the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans and i dont hesitate to recommend this film
clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante sondra lockewho is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk not that im complaining sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment
the characters at depth-less rip offs youve seen all the characters in other movies i promise the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field completely forced and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked the hot chick is old and has no personality shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non-underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing the attraction between molly the hot chick and kirk the dorky love interest is barely communicated the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt- mishap kiss occurs afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame the main focus of this movie is not the relationship but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super-bad-esquire movie with a semi appealing plot i could compare this to the hangover in its forced nature i wont get into that i could keep going but its just pointless just dont pay to see this movie
the fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it - but that doesnt make up for the fact that its pretty shabbily directed and acted - and with a very mediocre scriptb grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finishit would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film makinghopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on videothis film will open the queer film weekend in brisbane on april 10 2002 i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party - theyre gonna need it
youve gotta hand it to steven seagal: whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of ciera payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match angelina jolies and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling! and if it seems like im spending a little too much time talking about them its because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that its hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he cant even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a military-type actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesnt fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking *12
this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change there needs to be less talk and more action it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray
i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of indiana jones and the temple of doom unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn not like any yawn i have had before though this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie the cover described amazing special effects there were none the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence good if you want to teach your kids that i dont keep away from this one if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story wouldve been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if youre looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise visually stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed
this is the worst movie i have seen since i know who killed me with lindsey lohan after watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this hey tim burton i used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie i mean seriously what the f%#kwithout giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends oh wait here comes a spoilerspoiler alert! spoiler alert! at the end of the movie it rains i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew! comment one reviewer made regarding elisha cooks obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performancea bit of trivia that i am surmising about: cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that cooks spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by krupas work as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier if you watch krupa in ball of fire i think youll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time!
the cat onine tails il gatto a nove code aspect ratio: 235:1 cromoscopesound format: mono35mm and 70mm release printsa blind ex-journalist karl malden overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter james franciscus to investigate a series of murders at the lab unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killerrushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage 1969 dario argento conceived the cat onine tails as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton 1969 - and rising star franciscus the valley of gwangi sadly the resulting film - which the ads claimed was nine times more suspenseful than bird - is a disappointing follow-up impeccably photographed and stylishly executed but too plodding and aimless for general consumptionmalden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles and cinematographer enrico menczer the dead are alive uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which argentos dark-hearted scenario unfolds but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak the libertine as franciscus romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killers devious machinations but despite these flashes of brilliance the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil its no surprise that cat failed to emulate the runaway success of bird when released in 1971english version
the film is almost laughable with debbie reynolds and shelley winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers with the horrible notoriety after the trial the two women team up and leave ny for california in order to open and song and dance studio for shirley temple-like girlsfrom the beginning it becomes apparent that reynolds has made a mistake in taking winters with her to california winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker to make matters worse the women who live together are receiving menacing phone calls reynolds who puts on a blond wig is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students nicely played by dennis weaveragnes moorehead in one of her last films briefly is seen as sister alma who winters is a faithful listener ofthe film really belongs to shelley winters she is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better winters always did well in roles testing her nervesthe ending is of the macabre and who can forget winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die stanleys killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell brilliant movie
after watergate vietnam and the dark days of the nixon and jimmy carter eras what the world needed was a good old-fashioned chapter-play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the america of 1936 or the jungles of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures unfortunately what it got in 1975 was doc savage the man of bronze perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george pals final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robesons pulp-paperback novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other we can do better than that and adding a bullwhip a battered fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mixa big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman  explorer adventurer philanthropist a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a greek god or rather the form of tvs tarzan ron ely a rather dull charlton heston clone here theres simply nothing he cant do and more damagingly nothing that can harm him the man is the virtual incarnation of hitlers aryan ubermensch no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany! albeit with all-american values and just in case there should ever be anything hes overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage the less than fabulous five a chemist an electrician and even an archaeologist i can accept and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures in reality docs brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way  even kryptonite wouldnt put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories though with the exception of paul gleason theyre all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film youd happily kill them all off during the opening titles the villains fare no better with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas scott walker no a different one delivering one of cinemas worst accents is it meant to be scottish irish welsh greek pakistani or some nationality no-one has ever heard of while robyn hiltons marilyn monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakeseven with those drawbacks this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients  lost tribes a pool of gold a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why docs father was murdered unfortunately its a question of tone: in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes werent brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought the films aimed purely at the matinée market: you know for kids there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced  and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production be it the colgate twinkle in docs eye the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with captain seas or don blacks gung-ho lyrics to john philip sousas patriotic marches  but plenty was in the film to begin with after all its hard to see how one of the villains underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while docs explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam wests batman instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as doc displaying his sixth sense by er bobbing his adams appleperhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on themstill aside from docs various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously la standing in for new york while fred koenekamps cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget and its good to see a superhero movie that doesnt spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himselfits a film id really like to like more but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities no wonder doc savage the arch enemy of evil the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits never happened
demonicus is a movie turned into a video game! i just love the story and the things that goes on in the filmit is a b-film ofcourse but that doesn`t bother one bit because its made just right and the music was rad! horror and sword fight freaksbuy this movie now!
this movie is the perfect illustration of how not to make a sci fi movie the worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful sophomoric pseudo-orwellianhuxleyanwhateverian vision of the human futurescience fiction filmmakers and authors as geeks take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre i think other genres with a high ctgsr yes i just made it up relax like horror or action or even romantic comedy seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound messagesci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level as numerous great filmmakers have proven but there is an immense downside to the whole concept which is represented by robot jox with its low-rent construction of the future lone good design element: the bizarre slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies and its painfully heavy-handed iliad parallels hes named achilles for gods sake! i actually didnt pick up on this until i saw the film for like the tenth time but i went to public school so the filmmakers are not exoneratedof course if youre a crazy movie freak like me this downside has a great upside i absolutely love movies like this because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones its kind of a lester bangs approach to movie viewing i guessnote: the lead in this movie gary graham is that his name i refuse to go check is really not that bad he makes a go of it hes kind of cool especially when hes drunkhung over
they have sex with melons in asiaokay first i doubted that but after seeing the wayward cloud i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons with people dead or alive no safe sex of course the terrifyingly ugly leading man shoots it all into the ladys mouth after he did the dead lady never heard of hiv guess notthe rest of this movie is mainly boring but also incredibly revolting as a matter of fact in parts it got so disgusting i couldnt take my virgin eyes off sex with dead people! how gross is that and whats the message behind it all we need water we need melons we need to be dead to have sex sorry but this stinks!
i must say that looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student brannaghs version of hamlet is by far the best his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded it helps the play come to life on screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching as we did while studying it to follow and analyze the textone of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespearealso his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end all in all not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature phd to understand and enjoy it
the movie atlantis: the lost empire is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the disney studios recently parents who have had to sit through the jungle book 2 or even a pokemon movie will surely appreciate this onethe film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories films such as toy story finding nemo and monsters inc all do the same but it must be noted that all were made by pixar and only distributed by disney recent films from the disney studios are mostly released direct to video and are sequels to an existing successful film the quality of those films is given way to the profitability a new era started with atlantis following it were mulan lilo & stitch and most recently open range the writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the pasta good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find atlantis a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years including that of young milo thatch voiced by michael j fox milo is employed by a museum in washington dc his grandfather was a renowned archaeologist who had devoted his life to discovering atlantis this was seen as a waste by his peers and they wish milo to not follow in his footsteps after failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment she takes him to her employer a mr whitmore whitmore was a close friend of milos grandfather and wishes to send milo with a team to locate atlantis mr whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything the crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers the journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch the viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach atlantis the plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery atlantis not just the discovery of people it is enough to keep the interest of the older audiencethe animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation the movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer generated images a feat not easily achieved most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two the characters are believably human there are some nice chase type scenes with lots of action going on a few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not getthe creativity of the writers really shines through the culture of atlantis is richly developed including an entire language the film uses references to atlantis from historical sources such as plato the disappearance of atlantis from the world is explained believable if by a younger audience that magic really does exist the powers of the people of atlantis are not exactly presented as magic but can best be described in this wayalthough set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic the voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of captain nemos nautilus complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes the giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology the female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been even holding roles in leadership this is not a bad thing it gives a good role model for my daughter to look to rather than an all male castone reason this film is a favorite of mine over other disney films is that there is not one single song ever a tradition that began with the first feature film snow white and carried on through to the lion king almost every disney film is full of upbeat songs this is great and all what would the seven dwarfs be without hi ho! after the millionth time through itd almost be better without but this one spares the parent not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song i for one am gratefulthe storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike it is a film i am willing to watch again and again with my children
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi oh my god what a funny name ha ha doesnt ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny eg : gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi and so on i didnt even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someones coat is trapped in the door this happens about 5 times then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door dont ask why- dont ever ask why in this movie and the code word is ha ha: dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else: go to youtube and watch lord of the weed: its a lot lot more fun
rachel griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film a heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those weve loved and lost although only 15 minutes long griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time bud tingwell gives a touching performance as will a widower struggling to cope with his wifes death will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of ruths pet cow tulip the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost good cinematography great direction and superbly acted it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived
sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing and the best credit i can give this is that it maintains that old tradition these three tales arent anything as good as any from the original creepshowby far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners the second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it the third story includes a cameo from stephen king as a truck driver but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him downwatch the original creepshow instead or if you already have done then be happy with that
rex reed once said of a movie julia and julia to be specific that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly this one appeared to be shot through gauzethe story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time also everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters i call this the dead poets society syndromethere was nobody to care about nobody to become interested in dramatically and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstancesa total disappointment
the revolt of the zombies is not the worst movie ive ever seen but it is pretty far down on the list when an expedition is sent to cambodia to discover the trick to making zombies after world war i one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own evil ambitions and he succeeds at least at first a love triangle complicates the story somethis really was a tedious movie with horrible acting that made it difficult to tell who were zombies and who werent the dialog was little better and the plot was unbelievable not the zombie part of it but parts related to the romance and while i am not any student or expert on cinematography the camera work didnt seem to help the film much eitherwhile i have seen a few movies that are worse this is unlikely to please anyone its bad and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way
the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion as the relationships setting acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity direction and intensity to make matters worse his characters name is che and we are only told directly by the narrator well into the film that he is not that che just a guy named che the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided - the younger generation off to america so cliché other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boys family; however the political stance of the director is murky at best and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed so they lost their property acquired by gambling profits - so what refusing to take a political stand when making a movie about the cuban revolution is an odd and cowardly choice not to mention the movie was in english! why are all these cubans speaking english no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba and if family life is most important to look at here it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are introduced to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film! the acting was mostly shallow wooden and unbelievable timing was off all around the special visual effects were confusing and distracting references to american films - and the black character as greek chorus - strictly gratuitous intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity or some point to it all it never happened
i enjoyed watching brigham young and found it to be a positive and largely true portrayal of the lds faith i think that a remake of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial since many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions faced by the early mormon church it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted peopleas a member of the church the single most disturbing aspect of the film most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much was the portrayal of brigham young as one that had knowingly deceived church members into believing he had been called to be josephs successor as the prophet although i understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact when in reality both brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration the point is important for mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that god truly speaks to prophets today and that brigham young like joseph smith was an inspired prophet of godwhether or not you believe this statement or not just know that the film does not accurately portray what brigham himself believed
fanfan la tulipe is still gerard philippes most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the french cinema in the 1955-1965 yearsit made gina lollobrigida a star lollobrigida and philippe would team up again in rené clairs belles de nuit the same yearfanfan la tulipe is completely madsometimes verging on absurd henri jeansons witty lines -full of dark irony- were probably influenced by voltaire and candide antimilitarism often comes to the fore:these draftees radiate joie de vivre -and joie de mourir when necessary joy of life and joy of deathit becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors you won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me king louis xv complainsbut no matter lets wait for the next timea voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride:height of ironyits a genuine historian who speaks!christian-jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo :acceleratedremake in 2003 with vincent perez and penelope cruzi have not seen it but i do not think it had to be made in the first place
the story of a woman from nowhere is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western: a mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel: sergio leone and ennio morricone would be proud the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful ! woman saki ryoko yonekura on a harley and the location is in a town somewhere in japanin this actioner theres a considerable amount of gunplay some of it good some predictable and other spots somewhat hokey but its a whole lot of fun ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due it wasnt much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge but she handled things very well she shows her acting skills much more as otsu in the nhk drama musashiid highly recommend film if youre a ryoko yonekura fan which i adoringly am andor a girls with guns movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings to me theres something eminently and inexplicably appealing about girls with guns movies like la femme nikita and the long kiss goodnight and to have a gorgeous gal like ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake
few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later yet remain as engrossing as this one technological advances have not dated this classic love story special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie the acting is superb david niven kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job the use of black and white color adds to the creative nature of the movie it hasnt been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence it is my favorite movie of all time waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death
how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought manos: hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life
watched on hulu far too many commercials! so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian id protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesnt take place in india the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i cant find out where it is supposed to be happening
> you are warned this is a spoiler! > this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him madeline kahn and john houseman were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this boilerwhen with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed itthey must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle
this delectable fusion of new age babble and luridly bad film-making may not open you up to borrow one of the films favorite verbs but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching based on the best-selling book by james redfield first self published in 1993 this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an american history teacher matthew settle who on traveling to deepest darkest phoniest peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal namely what he discovers is a schlock shangri la populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated perhaps because theyre often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir although theres a lot of talk about energy that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include thomas kretschmann annabeth gish hector elizondo and jurgen prochnow all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon for those who care the plot involves the military terrorists and the roman catholic church; armand mastroianni provided the inept direction while mr redfield barnet bain and dan gordon wrote the hoot of a script in short easily the worst film seen in 40+ years of viewing movies
normally i am a pretty generous critic but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to bethere were some gorgeous shots but its too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie it might have worked if daggers was purely an action flick and not a romance but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle there is no chemistry between either of the couples whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love and for the most part the dialogue is just silly this may be just a problem with translation but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade not head-over-heels together forever worth-dying-for love; i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward i was slumped in my seat ready to snore but mostly i just cringed a lot*******spoiler*****now the icing on the cake or rather adding insult to injury the ending was truly one of the most horrible laughable ones i have ever seen the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other oh and then it starts to snow randomly oh and then mei dagger embedded in heart suddenly pops up out of the weeds then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach its destination even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet wow coolwell then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death jin sings sobs holds her body close screen goes blank i and the people surrounding me are chuckling not a good signvisually stunning but ultimately a failure
soon americans would swarm over a darkened damaged england preparing to invade europe but in 1937 the picture of hip americans in the sunny slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing idyllic diversion american dancing star & heartthrob jerry halliday astaire on a european tour & weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager burns is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress lady alice marshmorton fontaine the tale is complicated by a betting pool among the marshmorton servants that is run by and rigged for head butler keggs gardiner whos betting on lady alices cousin reggie noble the favorite of alices stuffy domineering aunt collier the story would have been much better as a half-hour tv episode the usual wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full-length film both alice & jerry appear impossibly and annoyingly clueless by the second half of the film the amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag fontaine is too beautiful too dignified & too quiet to be a ditzy blonde no matter how aristocratic while young footman albert watson is painfully awful but while damsel is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent the talent doesnt let us down astaires romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with ginger rogers and his dance scenes both solo & with burns & allen are up to par though his one dance with novice hoofer joan is necessarily tame gracie nearly steals the whole show as georges bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded conniving & coolly self-confident her scene with solid character actor gardiner as the devious snob keggs is a one-of-a-kind classic this & astaires priceless scene with the madrigal singers give damsel a delightful color of naive but noble-spirited americans mixing with noble but dull-spirited englishmen gershwin is at the top of his game with nice work if you can get it & stiff upper lip which carry the film through its weak points and is there another film where madrigals get a gershwin swing treatment damsel is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see astaire without rogers or fontaine before she was a real star its a fine diversion as entertaining as any of the vaudevillian musical comedies that ruled the 1930s but will never be made again
this movie was so great! i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says: rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry! i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies arent cheesy
where do you begin with a movie as bad as thisdo you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes the over-the-top acting the dreadful scriptno you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at i know i do i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire usually a bad sign if a preview copy isnt available to the quality movie mags however cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isnt happy with the finished producti went three days after it opened with two other mates the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his ownand that was on cheap nighteither the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this isnot since the days of the avengers 1998 have i felt so short changed since watching a movie if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching ittara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretarymind you considering she used to be in the word any viewers expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin withthe production values arent bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say fak! for a couple of hours then this should be right up your streetotherwise bargepoles required
i enjoyed american movie so i rented chris smiths first film which i thought was a documentary too in the first minute i saw that it wasnt but i gave it a gowhat a dead end film being true-to-life hardly serves you if youre merely going to examine tediousness esp tediousness that were already familar withim sorry but will it come as a relevation to anyone that 1 a lot of jobs suck and 2 most of them are crappy minimum wage jobs in the service sector i knew that before i saw the film it didnt really provide an examination of that anyway as while the film struggles to feel real handheld camera no music etc whats going on hardly plays out as it would in the real worldwould an employer be so cheerful to randy when he picks up his check after randy quit on him after 3 days when the guy said he expected him to stay 6 months or the day after abandoning his job and screwing up the machine he was working on that everyone would be so easy on hima big problem is our hero randy this guy is a loser not because hes stuck in these jobs or has a crummy apartment or looks like one hes a dope he doesnt pay attention or even really try at these jobs he has zero personalty if i had to hire someone he wouldnt make it past the interviewim looking forward to what chris smith does next but guys knock off the this-is-an-important-film stuff american job doesnt work
while this movie has many flaws it is in fact a fun 80s movie eddie murphy peaks during his 80s movies here while his character is indistinguishable from earlier movies his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foilscouple this with the hypnotic beauty of charlotte lewis this makes for a fun rainy day action-comedy flick
at the end of the movie i still dont know whether i liked it or not so was the case with most of the reviewers but none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in long ago i read a quote: there are 2 kind of writers 1 those who think and write and 2 those write and make the readers think while here i feel that guy ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audiencei felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of the devils advocate and fight clubit is definitely a classic: something which no one understands but appreciateswhat i dont understand: why stathomjake green had a blackout thats how it all began all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this onewell if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about: ill post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not: then answer this first when you come across a puzzle labeled as no one has ever solved would you like to try i would
i recently watched the 54 version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the 76 remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the 54 one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institutes top 100 list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critics list
picture the classic noir story lines infused with hyper-stylized black and white visuals of frank millers sin city then picture a dystopian science fiction thriller such as steven spielbergs minority report or richard linklaters a scanner darkly an amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director christian volckmans bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut but although volckmans work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them such a simplistic hybrid does not do renaissance volckmans end result justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than thatgenre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair especially in a contemporary context with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted as such renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama which serve to compliment each others storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion the screenplay is a clever and intriguing one although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the english translation - the films title also becomes far more poignant managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes making for a truly compelling workvolckmans film truly excels in its visual component and the stunning black and white animation is easily the films highlight - superbly moody and stylish it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have with tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene the film appears straight out of a frank miller comic but with a twist the end result being consistently visually sumptuous the films english rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting the gruff voice of daniel craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim stoic policeman karas and catherine mccormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sisters disappearance he is investigating despite a wavering english accent romola garai does great work as the frantic sister in question and jonathan pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation avalon ian holms reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist and holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenesall together renaissance boasts a visually stunning unique and compelling futuristic thriller just as intelligent as it is entertaining though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms for fans of either of the films intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of frank miller or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller the film is without question worth a watch-810
well youd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like set in tunis mom piddles around the flat gets antsy and decides albeit reluctantly she just cant help herself to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x2 and read the subtitles fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring uneventful low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits go figure c-
a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas nowhere close i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time but i read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value i was unable to find it though see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies i know i am not but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person he even tried to get simon & garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs of course they rejected
i suck at gratuitous boob references so im just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review i love elvira not in a im-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a 50s horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is elviras or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel freeps another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
okay note to the people that put together these horror acting legends dvd-collections: i truly am grateful and i hugely support the initiative but have you even watched the films before selecting them as part of the collection when i purchased the boris karloff collection there were several films in which the star only played a supportive and unessential role tower of london the strange door the invisible ray however is part of the bela lugosi collection and here its actually boris karloff who overshadows bela! this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead! bela lugosis character is quite possibly the most good-natured and earnest one he ever portrayed in his entire career and good old karloff actually plays the mad and dangerously obsessed scientist here the invisible ray features three main chapters the first one set in dr janos rukhs carpathian castle is pretty boring and demands quite a lot of the viewers patience but of course the character drawings and the subject matter discussed here are fundamental for the rest of the film dr rukh karloff demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues among them bela lugosi as dr benet how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device the scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite rukh and his lovely wife diane along for an expedition in the heart of africa there dr rukh isolates himself from the group discovers the essential element radium x to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks melting statues and a surprising climax karloff glows in the dark and convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch the narrative structure of the invisible ray sounds rather complicated but the film is easy to follow and entertaining the story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director lambert hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense boris karloff is truly fantastic and so is lugosi even though he deserved to have a little more screen time their scenes together are the highlights of the film along with the funky images of the glowing boris
annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joyi would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and its too bad for hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results the title is false as is everything about this film the period is not persuasively rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals arthur penns film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people even if the 1967 version didnt exist this would still be an unnecessary film the 1967 version strayed from the facts presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde but it was exciting and innovative for 1967 and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care this 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow unappealing and not the least bit interesting by all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better could it possibly be worse
one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries youll ever watch while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that prevail throughout the western hemisphere while essentially another chapter in the story of the us backed latin american coup this film chronicles in real-time what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity political savvy and courage! the political insights offered by this film are invaluable one gets clear examples of the private media as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of american politics one gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny which has been abruptly and illegally thrust upon them by the conspirators we also see the arrogance and fascism of the cia backed private media plutocrats and generals whove conspired to bring venezuela back under washingtons domination though ably led by president hugo chavez the people of caracas are forced to act without him after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals their response is the highpoint of the film if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the us government hugo chavez and revolutionary venezuela are all about this movie is it!
i am a lover of b movies give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing then there was hammerhead which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others first there was the science of creating the shark-man which the movie barely touched on in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead what fabulous special effects back to the science i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and im sorry to say pretty bad acting not even william forsythe hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker
as someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale i was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have beenthe bad - im a fan of robert duvall and many of the characters he has played but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigatorthe dialog is insipid and the pretty kathryn harrold is real garbage-mouth from what i read there were several directors replacing each other on this film and thats too bad you can tell things arent right with the story i couldnt get involved with treat williams portrayal of cooper either he should have been fascinating but he wasnt in this movie its also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of folk hero but i admit i wound up rooting for the guy toonot everything was disappointing i cant complain about the scenery from the lush green forests of oregon to the desert in arizonaid like to see this movie re-made and done better because it is a one-of-a-kind story
taiwanese director ang lee whose previous films include sense and sensibility and the ice storm turned to the american civil war for his latest feature based on a novel by daniel woodrell it follows the exploits of a group of southern guerrillas known as bushwhackers as they fight their northern equivalents the jayhawkers in the backwater of missourias one might expect there is plenty of visceral action but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family jake roedel tobey maguire is such a man or rather boy as he is only seventeen when the war reaches missouri he is the son of a german immigrant but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a unionist he joins his lifelong friend jack bull chiles skeet ulrich and rides with the bushwhackers despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed union men he remains loyal to the cause so does his friend daniel holt jeffrey wright a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the southlee handles the subject with aplomb never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting the action is unglamorised and admirably candid recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocitiesthe performances are superb with maguire and wright both courageous and dignified up-and-coming irish actor jonathan rhys meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer while skeet ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant lee never flinches from the reality of war but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship the demonstration of courage and on a wider scale the emancipation of oppressed peoples ride with the devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience
darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment; ie bad taste it started off really good with a man running from something it was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went that with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind as said before gore was this films only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out
a pale shadow of a great musical this movie suffers from the fact that the director richard attenborough completely misses the point of the musical needlessly opens it up and muddies the thrust of the play the show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a bway musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls assuming that they are trying to get their big break in show business rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working gypsies living show to show along with a couple of newcomers the film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 1617 on the line depending on how you count cassie who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film
not a bad word to say about this film really i wasnt initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people cant see past the fact that it was banned in some territories mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book ive noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killers pov shot and i ask: whats wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killers identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twistkiller revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people! believe me!
spoilersthe one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiners henna rinse one of the worst dye jobs ever that and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal steiners invention mst3k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funnyi particularly like it when crow kills mike with his touch of death and when he revives him in the theatre mike cries guys i died i saw eternal truth and beauty! oh its this movie that would be a letdown having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of the projected man the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide some of the puns in the film were wicked: police inspector-electrocution! crow-shocking isnt it police inspector-thats lowe all right tom servo-very low right down by the floor! police inspector-can i get on tom servo-hes dead but knock yourself out mst3k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer
whats not to like about this movie every year you know that youre going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him what is the good of having money like that if you cant do fun things with it it was a win-win situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined only ifdrew latham ben affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands it was a fun and funny movie
the korean war has been dubbed americass forgotten war so many unanswered questions were buried along with the 50 thousand men who died there occasionally we are treated to a play or movie which deals with that far-off ghostly frozen graveyard here is perhaps one of the finest its called sergeant ryker the story is of an american soldier named sgt paul ryker lee marvin who is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer his task is to defect to the north koreans and offer his services against united nations forces so successful is his cover he proves invaluable to the enemy and given the rank of major however he is thereafter captured by the americans put on trial as a traitor and spy stating he was ordered to defect he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence he is convicted and sentenced to hang however his conviction is doubted by capt young bradford dillman his prosecutor convincing commanding gen amos baily lloyd nolan of his doubts he is granted a new trial and if found guilty will be executed the courtroom drama is top notch as is the cast which includes peter graves murray hamilton and norman fell as sgt max winkler korea was a far off place but the possibility of convicting a communist and hanging him hit very close to home in the 1950s due to its superior script and powerful message this drama has become a courtroom classic excellent viewing and recommended to all ****
heres my first david mamet directed film fitting since it was his first as well the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con its like the grifters but without that films level of acting in that film john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character the acting here is very flat i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis at least in the beginning it never gets really good but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes early in the film some of lindsay crouses lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if theyre inner monologue or narration which they arent with the arrival of mantegna things pick upthe dialogue here isnt as fun as it should be i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue but these ones dont it all sounds very read rather than spoken maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up but if not then maybe he should let others direct his words hes far too precious with them here and as a result they lose their rhythmic jazzy quality whats more strange is that other than this the film doesnt look or feel like a play the camera is very cinematic my only problem with glengarry glen ross was that it looked too much like filmed theatre but in that film the actors were not only accomplished but relaxed and free everything flowedi wouldnt mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie or even book characters speaking play lines its a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesnt work that doesnt mean the movie is bad -- it isnt its often extremely entertaining the best chunk is in the middleits standard con movie stuff: the new guy in this case girl margaret ford lindsay crouse gets involved in the seedy con underworld how she gets involved is: shes a psychiatrist and one of her patients billy is a compulsive gambler she wants to help him out with his gambling debt so she walks into the house of games a dingy game room where con men work in a back room ill admit the setup is pretty improbable were they just expecting crouse to come in were they expecting shed write a cheque was billy in on it one of these questions is definitely answered by the end howeverand from here the cons are start to roll out i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun were getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is we see the ending coming and then we didnt see the second ending coming and then the real ending i didnt see coming but maybe you did the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true callingim going to forgive the annoying opening the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here if the first part of the movie seems stagy stick with it after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going if you want a fun con movie then here she is if you want mamet go watch glengarry glen ross again -- james foley did him better***
a worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut outwith such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable behaviorthe homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picturea regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss
a recent viewing of thats entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town the songs arent as good nor is the chemistry between the characters but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites such as tchaikovsky and the scene at the hollywood bowl with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top and then running down the steps while dozens of pianists play on the piano is the best scene in the film even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing sinatra then croons i fall in love too easily before having his epiphany about whom he loves the color is beautiful hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution-free air can you imagine hollywood in the twenties let alone the mid-1940s! and the piano music is absolutely glorious mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these
ive seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at other than that i can only recollect randomness and dead air snl & samberg fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had more important things to do plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too girly then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it full house has made me laugh and cry its made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable but look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt the three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times whats any more real than that if anything the show has lifted me up when im down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness i have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over mary kate and ashley olsen of course hilary duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies i have ever seen they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people
when i really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven i had a big list of must see films and i would go to blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts i remember one of the films on that list was a chorus line and could never get it; so now to see it is a dream come trueof course i lost the list and i would do anything to get it back because i think there were some really interesting things to watch there i mean take a chorus line a stage play turned into film i know its something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently; and this film has something specialmost of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; a chorus line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie following a big audition held by recognized choreographer zach michael douglas richard atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the jobeverything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancers and it all occurs on the stage where douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences there are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go bylike a movie i saw recently a prairie home companion the broadcast of a radio show atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity on or behind the stage things are going on and time doesnt seem to stop again i dont if atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesnt look like it; and anyway its a great directing and editing john bloom work but in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camera with only one setting ronnie taylors cinematography finds the way making close-ups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of new yorkin one crucial moment douglas tells the ones that are left: before we start eliminating: youre all terrific and id like to hire you all; but i cant this made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good its hard you must imagine; at least here where all of them really are terrificto tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true the music by marvin hamlisch and the lyrics by edward kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by michael bennett the book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by arnold schulman; which is very touching at times so if its not with a song it will be with a word; but in a chorus line its impossible not to be movedduring one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition cassie a special dancer played by alyson reed takes the stage to convince douglas character that she can do it the words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics
the full title of this film is may you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows youre dead a rewording of the old irish toast may you have food and raiment a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven before the devil knows youre dead first time screenwriter kelly masterson with some modifications by director sidney lumet has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes in this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but here very sensible manipulation of the flashbackflash forward technique of storytelling by repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong andy hanson philip seymour hoffman is a wealthy executive married to an emotionally needy gina marisa tomei and addicted to an expensive drug habit his life is beginning to crumble and he needs money andys nere-do well younger brother hank ethan hawke is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife martha amy ryan is behind in alimony and child support and has borrowed all he can from his friends and he needs money andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe quick cash for both the glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the mens parents - charles albert finney and nanette rosemary harris andy advances hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that hank will do the actual robbery but though hank agrees to the fail-safe plan he hires a friend to take on the actual job while hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car the robbery is horribly botched when nanette filing in for the regular clerk shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess the disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when nanette dies charles and andy and hank and their respective partners are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances and while we have come to expect that from hoffman hawke tomei finney ryan and harris it is the wise hand of direction from sidney lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful it is not an easy film to watch but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be grady harp
i thought i had seen this movie twice in fact then i read all the other reviews and they didnt quite match up a man and three young students two girls and a boy go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings i still feel pretty confident that this is the movie i saw despite the discrepancies in the reviews therefore im putting my review back: if you like the occasional b movie as i do then return to boggy creek is the movie for you! whether its setting the sleep timer and nodding off to your favorite movie-bomb or just hanging out with friends boggy creek the mute button and youve got a fun night of improv look out! is the legend true i think we just might find out along with a not-so-stellar cast will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film does our blonde manly young hero have any chest hair will the exceptionally high-tech technicolor last the entire film youll have to watch to find out for yourself
maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility she will do everything to make her marriage work including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation and thus beneath the vicey exterior she reveals a rather sweet value system the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with and then i woke up it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence ive ever seen but dont let any of that put you off
not even goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what gore has done with this complete piece of fiction this is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say the scientists gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers psychologists and psychiatrists would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro-surgery the field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support gores alarmist claims of global warming as one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years i have not seen any evidence to support global warming my analysis of this movie and gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant no more no less ask any global warming alarmist or journalist one simple question- you say global warming is a major problem tell me what temperature is the earth supposed to be
this film got terrible reviews but because it was offbeat and because critics dont usually get offbeat films i thought id give it a try unfortunately they were largely right in this instancethe film just has an awkward feel too it that is most off putting the sort of feel that is impossible to describe but its not a good one to further confound things the script is a dull aimless thing that is only vaguely interestingthe immensely talented thurman just drifts through this mess creating barely an impact hurt and bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiastic performance but there is nothing in the script it may have been less embarrassing for them if they had merely chosen to drift and get it over with like thurmanone thing the esteemed film critics did fail to mention however is that the film is actually quite funny whether it be moments of accurate satire or some outrageously weird moments like when the cowgirls in question chase hurt off their ranch with the smell of their unwashedahemfront bottomsbecause of the chortles acheived throughout while i wouldnt recommend this film there is entertainment to be had and watching even cowgirls get the blues is worthwhile for something different

this is probably one of the worst movies ever made itsterrible but its so good! its probably best if you dont watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because youre going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and goros fantastic hairbad english youre in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless youre having a competition to spot the most plot holesscrew ups in which case youve got hours of entertainment ahead id only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard smap fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because goros japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out he wasnt really not when johnny kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him
when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie - which is no great surprise since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the worldi was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had deliberately obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audienceso when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen i was delighted with what i saw alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain tv series the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirlbut best of all the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be allowing for the absence of a stageso if you know the musical and few do not then check out this telemovie it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered which is good enough for me what is better than rendering a writers work faithfully and with colour and style
in anticipation of ang lees new movie crouching tiger hidden dragon i saw this at blockbuster and figured id give it a try a civil war movie is not the typical movie i watch luckily though i had a good feeling about this director this movie was wonderfully written the dialogue is in the old southern style yet doesnt sound cornily out of place and outdated the spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie toby maguire was awesome i thought he was good but nothing special in pleasantville but here he shines i have always thought of skeet ulrich as a good actor but nothing special but here he is excellent as well the big shocker for me was jewel she was amazingly good jeffrey wright who i had never heard of before is also excellent in this movie it seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand a movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa this movie had the perfect combination the actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular this movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others it lets you really get to know the characters which are all very dynamic and interesting the plot is complex and keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing and ready for anything at any time literally dozens of times i was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet brilliant directing this was also a beautifully shot movie the scenery was not breath taking its in missouri and kansas for goodness sakez but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings has that rough and rugged feel but keeps an elegance which is very pleasant on the eyes the movie was deep it told a story and in doing so made you think it had layers underneath that exterior civil war story specifically it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for there were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie too many to pick out it was like a beautifully written short story filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done if you like great acting writing lots of action and some of the best directing ever see this movie! take a chance on it
heres how you do it: believe in god and repent for your sins then things should turn around within the next day or so until the last fifteen minutes this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunks crappy life his mom dies his stepmoms a b_tch his dad dies he drinks he gets married he has kids he drinks some more his wife gets mad he disappoints his kids the wife threatens to leave he calls up a reverend late night bc he wants to kill himself then after the recap happens thats when we get the left behind-like subtle messagehe needed a paycheck this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldnt lose my respect for madsenmadsen drops to his knees and begs christs forgiveness once he does he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way he tells his wife that hes found god and thats good enough for her flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol final moment he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar ie sin house and give a gay miami-vice after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames see why i had to repeat the phrase he needed a paycheckman this movie is bad the b-grade 80s production values dont help much the script could have easily been a touched by an angel episode it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials the acting is wooden and never believable even madsen of whom im a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesnt know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged this thing was like homework i just wanted to put it away and say that alright i saw half of it thats good enough but no if i sat through cheerleader ninjas i could sit throughout thisthe only reason im not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1 i love madsen i know its not fair but its great seeing the opening title introducing michael madsen sue me 2 some of the dialogue is so bad that its classic ill stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them toothats about it to wrap it up this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds but hey! look! michael madsen! see also tilt executive target my bosss daughter etc now ive gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him see ya kidsthis stuffs gonna make me go blind but im gonna drink it anyway - madsens first taste of cheap alcoholi dont understand! everything seems so beautiful! - madsen walking outside after confessing to godim going downtown later and pick up a bible and im gonna get a haircut too - madsen after converting at the dinner table because satan lives in your hair
paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last! ive heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project all i have to say to that isare you kidding me come on it was not that bad at all i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography as for the rest of the movie i really didnt even notice ityou can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne sometimes that can be a bad thing but in this case its a really good thing he really becomes jason bourne in this installment damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen ezra kramer and julia stiles david strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret cia organizationeven though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on this film stands far above the other two bourne movies and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season!
seriously crappy moviefirst off the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehousefurniture store the bad cop takes a girl which they had pulled over into the warehouses attic while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there the bad cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag and the newbie cop doesnt think there are any problems but he still wonders what was in the bag so he asks gets a bullshit response and then he thinks everything is ok for nowthe bad cop repeats this process and even once with a tit scene made it slightly better but eventually people start to catch on which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was one girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies like ya do now the bad cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch and then he gets rid of the duffel-bagged bodysince she had the oogey-boogey magic put on her she comes back with lots of eye-shadow on which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie also the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become eye-shadow monsters some of the girls meet up with a dude who is apparently a currency specialist and he offers them a ride they look normal to him apparently but when the girls see other people such as the one girls husband he freaks out because she is hideous some people freak out but others dont even notice massive plot holeso to wrap it up the eye-shadow monsters kill the bad cop who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene it was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel! like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping
of all the films i have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his b movies but this is a sure w movie w=wastetake for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds a huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough truly a miracle not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle
this movie was disaster at box office and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie sweetness of the story music was good story is very simple and old but presentation of such story is very good director tried his best abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene soha looks so sweet in the movie rest star cast was simply okay music and all songs are good himesh is impressive as an singer here dont miss this movie its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us abhay best work till date i will give 910 to ahista ahista
8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc the hennessy clan -- mother cate katey sagal daughters bridget kaley cuoco and kerry amy davidson and son rory martin spanjers -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul john ritter the family patriarch cates parents james garner and suzanne pleshette lend a hand i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series just shoot me! but all and all this show is pretty good this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that used to be on abc
this movie was strange i watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis mushrooms it was really weird im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high but mushrooms werent enough i couldnt stop laughing maybe lsd would work the movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things and dancing its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind i could see how some people would think this movie was good but i didnt think it was very interesting and i was on mushrooms at the time if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit pop it on youll get a few laughs
*** contains spoilers ***i did not like this movie at alli found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die how should we approach life in a light way like tomas; in a heavy way like tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question like sabina how much is fidelity important in a relationship how much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones how much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our countryunfortunately i havent read kunderas novel but after having being let down by the movie i certainly will: i want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation which is my guess or if it was dull from the beginningi disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece i simply dont see the reasons why what i see are many flaws and a sample of them follows1 the three main characters are thrown at you and its very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices2 the secondary characters are there just to fill the gaps but they dont add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary3 i did not like how tomas was impersonated nothing is good for him he is so self-centered and selfish he is not human in some sense but when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone i did not find the interpretation credible4 its very unlikely that an artist like sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968 on top of that the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions which sounds strange to me a how can tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer b how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed5 the fake accents of the english spoken by the actors are laughable and i am not even mother tongue moreover the letter that sabina receives while in the us is written in czech which i found very inconsistent6 many comments praised the movie saying that prague was beautifully rendered: i guess that most of the movie was shot on location so its not difficult to give the movie a eastern european feeling and given the intrinsic beauty of prague is not even difficult to make it look good7 i found the ending sort of trivial tereza and tomas finally happy in the countryside far away from the temptations of the metropoly distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living detached from their professional lives die in a car accident but they die after having realized that they are happy indeed so what had they died unhappy would the message of the movie have been different i dont think so i considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience8 the only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters you see them for almost three hours but in the end you are left with nothing you dont feel empathy you dont relate to them you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say9 i hated the stop the music in the restaurant scene which some comments praised a lot why sabina has got such a strong reaction why franz agrees with her i really dont see the point the only thing you learn is that sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality thats it whats so special and unique about itafter all these negative comments let me point tout that there are two scenes that i liked a lot thats why i gave it a twothe naked women photoshoot where the envy the jealousy and the insecurities of sabina and tereza are beautifully presentedthe other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of prague by the russians tereza pictures taken to let the world know about what is going on in prague are used to identify the people taking part to the riots i found it quite original and terezas sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayedfinally there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally designed in such a way that tomas types are going to like it and tereza ones are going to hate it if this is the case i strongly doubt it though then my comment should be revised drastically
for this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be comparedfirst off the beginning did have elements of styleand if handled well could have become a cult classic a-la pulp fiction or a desi desperadobut the plot was there one begins to meander and at one point completely loses itthrow in a deranged don with an obsession for english a call center smart alec a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb a levitating gravity defying hit-man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their trailgood ingredients in competent hands but this is where i would like to ask the director: sir what were you smokingim sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the musicwatch the videoshear the airplay and you wont be disappointed vishal- shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candyas i sign off i want to really badly know how does akshays bullet wound vanish in a microsecondwhat were you editors doing tashan maybe
this dreadful film assembles every asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package money grubbing devious japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman pat morita to recover industrial secrets in detroit here he encounters a down at heel jay leno who promptly refers to a murder victim as a jap and calls morita tojo its all downhill from there
the original movie the odd couple has some wonderful comic one-liners the entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat-freak felix ungar and funny obnoxious slob oscar madison this paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful tv series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good imitationsthe odd couple movie has some wonderful jokes about oscars apartment and his sloppy habits he says who wants food one of his poker player buddies asks what do ya got oscar says i got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches whats the brown its either very new cheese or very old meat! i also love the line about oscars refrigerator its been out of order for two weeks i saw milk standing in there that wasnt even in a bottle! there is no question that walter matthaus oscar madison is a joy to watch on screen hes almost as good as jack klugmans version in the tv seriesthe problem with the movie is jack lemmons felix ungar jack makes a very very honest effort at the role the problem is that he makes felix so depressing and down-trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical tony randalls performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to felixs character which lemmons portrayal lacks tonys felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time however in the tv series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline jacks felix ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting the movie felix ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the timethe movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever! one of the other great examples of felixs little notes on oscars pillow will be remembered forever however there are some darker sides where oscar goes over the top his crying near the end after bawling out felix and a scene involving felixs linguine dinner although lightened by a funny line seem more depressing than comicalperhaps there wasnt enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie the beginning 20 minutes are very boring the same issue occurs with felixs conversation with the pidgeon sisters the movies ending is predictable and too pat theres very little care or compassion for each of them by the other the result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above it appears that jack lemmons monotone persona of felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the charactersit really took the 1970s tv series to make the odd couple the best that it could be the original film is still very good however the tv series is much better
gédéon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11having worked with james hanlons ladder company before jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into tower onejules asked the captain to follow him into the towers the first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film he stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were therethe brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from dvd sales go to 911-related charities very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date

one of boris karloffs real clinkers essentially the dying karloff looking about 120 years older than he wasis a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies moving from morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the south of france where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying she will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo who i think is married if you think i got that from watching the movie youre wrong i had to read what other people posted to figure out happened why because this movie had me lost from two minutes ini had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines little is spelled out and much isnt said until towards the end by which time i really didnt care its a dull mess of interest purely for karloffs performance which is rather odd at times to be honest this is the only time ive ever seen him venture into bela lugosi bizarre territory its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out
it is not every films job to stimulate you superficially i will take an ambitious failure over a mass-market hit any day while this really cant be described as a failure the sum of its parts remains ambiguous that indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again this is a challenging provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly the problem with the movie is in its structure its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up just as a second ending is tacked on though everything is technically dazzling the movie is exactly too long by that unit the long-delayed climax of leos awakening comes about 20 minutes lategreat cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas the compositing artifice is provocative and engaging; a character is rear-projected but his own hand in the foreground isnt the world depicted is deliberate treacherous and absurd keep your eyes peeled for a memorable technically astonishing assassination that will make your jaw dropthe compositions are stunning whomever chose to release the out of print videotape in the pan & scan format must have never seen it where is the dvdit is unfathomable how anyone could give this much originality a bad review you should see it at least once you get the sense that von trier bit off more than he could chew but this movie ends up being richer for it i suspect he is familiar with hitchcocks foreign correspondent in which devious europeans also manipulate an american dupe and several welles movies that take delirious joy in technique as much as he does all von trier movies explore the plight of the naif amidst unforgiving societies after zentropa von trier moved away from this type of audacious technical experiment towards dreary over-rated un-nuanced sap like breaking the waves and dancer in the dark
lol! not a bad way to start it i thought this was original but then i discovered it was a clone of the 1976 remake of king kong i never saw king kong until i was 15 i saw this film when i was 9 the films funky disco music will get stuck in your head! not to mention the films theme song by the yetians this is the worst creature effects ive ever seen at the same time this film remains a holy grail of b-movies memorable quotes: take a tranquilizer and go to bed put the yeti in your tank and you have yeti power i remember seeing this film on movie macrabe hosted by elvira there is one scene where it was like king kong in reverse! in king kong he grabs the girl and climbs up the building but in this film he climbs down the building and grabs the girl who was falling! also around that year was another kong clone mighty peking man 1977 which came from hong kong there is a lot of traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts this film will leave you laughing it is like i said just another king kong clone rated pg for violence language thematic elements and some scary scenes
modern viewers know this little film primarily as the model for the remake the money pit older viewers today watch it with wisps of nostalgia: cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas were all superstars in an easier less complicated era or was it time of course has a way of modifying perspectives and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older seemingly less provocative films in mr blandings builds his dream house there may therefore be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948 there is political commentary however subtle finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience only lightly softened by the coming of levittowns and the like politics in the movie the blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school which in real life would get teachers accused of communism in real life too myrna loy was a housing activist a democrat and a feminist melvyn douglas was no less a democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman helen gahagan douglas whom young richard nixon accused of being soft on communism and which ruined her jason robards sr has a small role in the film but his political activism was no less noticeable more importantly his son jason robards jr would be for many years a very active liberal democrat almost the odd fellow out was cary grant whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in hollywood that was already slipping but this was 1948: communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner it would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films and then not so subtly
like most comments i saw this film under the name of the witching which is the reissue title apparently necromancy which is the original is better but i doubt itmost scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad in many ways i think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! but dont be fooled -theres only 3 scenes with nudity and its of the people standing around variety no diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!this movie is so inherently awful its difficult to know what to criticise first the dialogue is awful and straight out of the troma locker at least troma is tongue in cheek though this is straight-faced boredom personified the acting is variable with pamela franklin flora the possessed kid in the innocents would you believe! the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque the other female lead has a creepy face so i dont know why pamela thought she could trust her in the film! and the doctor is pretty bad too he also looks worringly like gene wilderit is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy this is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that only the lighting is ok the sound is also dreadful and its difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up the ghost mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughsreally this film the witching at least is only for the unwary it cant have many sane fans as its pretty unwatchable and i actually found it mind-numbingly dull! the best bit was when the credits rolled - enough said so simply better to this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!
diana guzman is an angry young woman surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas she takes her anger out on the closest targetswhen she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club she knows shes found her home the film progresses from there as diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing michelle rodriguez is very good in the role particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexismthe picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors who pale in comparison to the older more experienced cast there are too many pauses in the script which detracts from the dramatic tension the overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity this is a good picture to see once if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category

first of all yes im white so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people = bad but black people hating white people = ok because apparently we deserved it!! where do i start i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes: the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in a fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neo-nazis and win!!! the neo-nazi where twice the size : and the chase! the chase is priceless this is not a movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesnt deliver this is a racist movie that re-affirm all the cliché stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinheadcmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing itsave your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history x now thats a movie
a film that is so much a 30s warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the objectcuritz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners a studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatreseven though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been torn from the headlines another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that theyre not the trophies gives the film a more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50s when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editingthank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along
though im not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans ching siu tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty the great tragic leslie cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky taoist cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and wu ma is pleasingly off the wall as the taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive the film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package ching siu tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if im not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere an ethereal treasure highly recommended
i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike crouching tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up closei think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of mahayana buddhist text mahayana buddhism can be found in china korea and japan and the other scene deals with a quirk in the japanese calendarpeople back then really thought that the world would come to an end gojoe has the action story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer i strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the us my one complaint is in the last fight scene i cant give anything away--sorry
i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales well for the previous it is better than daytime televisionthough im not sure how muchit does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together in short a terrible sci fi channel type movieit has its points such as the future is dirty like blade runner showed of course this is no blade runner the captain looks sort of feels like actor robert forster the kind of person one might want to be aroundbut unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad andromeda rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of aliens the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified and the new captain might as well be like jan-michael vincent running around on danger island in the banana splits; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; hes got very little right to it all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the eureka maru as they are fighting a class of people who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualitiesjust like the nietzcheans in andromedait might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! he probably had fun doing it but it doesnt help the movie muchits okay okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel one might watch it once but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it allfor me that was the femme fatale when she was fighting
usually any film with sylvester stallone is usually going to suck ass rambo: first blood part ii was no exception to this the only movies that sylvester stallone were in that were good were rocky and first blood this film is extreamly unrealistic and boring it has action but not very good action i didnt enjoy watching it and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie award for worst picture i would give this a 310 the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough
this is a very entertaining movie a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who apparently think that the film was an effort at serious drama it was not made that wayit is an extremely enjoyable film performed in a tongue in cheek manner all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us the fight sequences are lively brisk and above all not gratuitous the so-called green death utilized on a couple of occasions is not as i read in one review gruesome a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film hey lighten up again i remind one and all that this is a fun film each phase of this fight was captioned which added to the fun aspect the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan this is not one of those martial arts films ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the bad guy seas is dealt with i promise you that if you dont try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner
think pierce brosnan and you think suave dapper intelligent james bond in this movie brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so as does the audience this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman and it works!this is a fun movie with very good scenes a riveting on-the-edge brosnan and a good compliant off-the-edge kinnear have some good lines my only cavil is that hope davis playing the oh-so-tolerant wife can i see your gun doesnt appear more often: she could have been a marvellous foil to these menthis movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience while going for a kill the ending is awesome because a storyline with a positive moral! emerges: this is a frenetic frantic and fun movie which does deserve a wide audience
a new way to enjoy goldsworthys work rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion watching goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he uses goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the tides inspires and affects his work although i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthys pieces no snowballs i do feel it was a bit long the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthys work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch
the only thing i remember about this movie are two things: first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed itif you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house its so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl spacklers correct me if im wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers theyll lock me up and throw away the key
this is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time soha ali and abhay deol both look very beautiful soha reminds you so much of her mother sharmila tagore abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming futurethe ending of the movie is very different from most movies in a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone the movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get married in court her boyfriend does not show up and she ends up being helped by the witness slowly slowly over the time he falls in love for her it is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not watch the movie for complete details the movie really belongs to abhay i look forward to seeing more movies from him soha is pretty but did not speak much in the movie her eyes her innocence did most of the talking
i just didnt get this moviewas it a musical nobut there were choreographed songs and dancing in itwas it a serious dramano the acting was not good enough for thatis whoopi goldberg a quality serious actordefinently noti had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worsesee for yourself but in fairness i hated it
granting the budget and time constraints of serial production batman and robin nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any cliffhanger list utterly lacking the style imagination and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor batmanthe producer sam katzman was known as king of the quickies and like his director spencer bennett seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement unfortunately this team also produced the two superman serials starring kirk alyn with their tacky flying animation canned music and dull supporting players the opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly inane titles robin rescues batman batman vs wizard mechanical music droning on and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap halloween masks batmans cowl with its devils horns and eagles beak fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes his utility belt is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!in any case the lead players are miscast robert lowery displays little charm or individual flair as bruce wayne and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as batman he creates the impression that hed rather be somewhere anywhere else! john duncan as robin has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue he is too old for the part with an even older stuntman filling in for him out of costume lowery and duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink without one ounce of the chemistry evident between lewis wilson and douglas croft in the 1943 serialalthough serials were not known for character development the earlier batman managed to present a more energetic cast this one offers a group going through the motions not that the filmmakers provide much support not one of the hoodlums stands out and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever the wizard great name! actually they are led by someone sporting a curtain a shawl and a sack over his head with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing the prime suspects -- an eccentric professor a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoyingeven the established comic book regulars are superfluous it is hard to discern much romance between vicki vale and bruce wayne despite the perils she faces vicki displays virtually no emotion commissioner gordon is none-too-bright unlike in the previous serial alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is mr waynes residence they are props for a drawn-out gimmick-laden incoherent plot further saddled with uninspired repetitive music and amateurish production design the wayne manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel the batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing the costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!pity that the filmmakers couldnt invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure while the availability of the two serials on dvd is a plus for any serious batfan one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box they capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of batman and robin combinednow for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version!
this move was on tv last night i guess as a time filler because it sucked bad! the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way not bad tits and ass though but the story is too ridiculous for words the wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth when it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some interns working on the cgi because the wolf runs like hes running in a treadmill and the cgi fur looks like its been waxed all shiny :the movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killedslashedeaten next even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didnt do a good job at itdont even get me started on the actors very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds but then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do i sign upoverall boring and laughable horror
