this probably my favorite mug . it easily holds twice much regular coffee cup . it comes plastic splash guard locks into place down inside rim . best thing mug though wide grippy bottom enables me set it just anywhere my car without worrying it tip over . even hard corners don't seem phase it . it also only cup my house withstand my cat efforts tip it over . odd shape also downsides though . it won't fit any cup holder i've ever come across , but doesn't matter much since it won't tip over no matter where you set it . if you don't rinse it out immediately , it difficult clean later , due shape ; if you don't small hands , you may need bottle cleaning brush . also , i imagine if you more than one these mugs , they'd awkward store since this mug tends hog cabinet space . despite this , it still great mug . fact i'm going need since my husband now adopted it his favorite too	1

i'd looking good juicer number months , but shied away because they're expensive . i saw this deal , read analyzed reviews , rolled dice . it arrived yesterday , after easily disassembling it wash parts get know it initially , i ran half dozen carrots through it . omg !! fast delicious carrot juice my own kitchen ! clean-up easy ( well , i old pro now ) quick -- under five minutes . address some negatives you may read , first , size : course it big . they're all big bulky . it their nature . second , residue : my carrot pulp dry . i suppose if i'd put it floor stood it i might gotten maybe teaspoon carrot juice out it . third , it factory reconditioned : me , that plus . consider this : manufacturer rolls out tens thousands these off line , each one eye-balled polished qc before bagging boxing , assuming they all good go . but , factory re-con gone over top bottem , inside out before it released . no assumptions -- last thing manufacturer wants see thing back again , so you know they'll make sure they don't . if it'd returned little cosmetic blem , i certainly live considering discount i'm getting . i'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away , but waring old trusted brand , juicer not cheaply made . i'll back year ( hopefully not sooner ) give some time perspective this review . soon i finish writing this , i'm ordering two more christmas gifts .	1
somewhat insomniac i read well into hours night book light essential me . i therefore purchased itty bitty booklight . if you use this light it essential purchase power supply two reasons . firstly , there no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard eyes difficult read resulting constant need new batteries . this light also extremely fragile . over couple years i went through 7 these ! i would not recommend this light - amount you spend never-ending purchasing batteries or expensive power supply , constant new purchases after it breaks , you might well splurge buy decent book light . i now tri lite capstone enterprises ( available barnes nobel - come get it stock amazon ! ) it terrific ! it clock alarm timer . you set it stay any period time once it reaches time light flashes . time you extend minutes . if you don't so , example you're sleeping , it automatically shut off . it also produces much more light much brighter than itty bitty book light	1

i'm absolutely thilled this waring ! it definitely changed my opinion juicers . i purchased reconditioned model . it arrived factory ( re ? )-packaged looked brand new . not single mark it , not even fingerprint ! it far easier clean , obviously superior design : parts clean up like new dishwasher . components fit perfectly , despite probably couple hundred uses . it exponentially faster , remainders noticeably dryer . ( reviewer mentioned , this refuse obviously indicates very efficient juicer ! ) looks , sounds functions like very upscale appliance . no spraying , no movement , no juicer " drama " ! :-) absolutely best one i've owned after lots uses , it still going strong it when it arrived .	1

my three year old med-length hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush . she gets persistent dandruff furballs but won't let me touch her any other brush . i tried every kind brush but she hates groomed ! so imagine my surprise when i pull this brush out package she actually lays down me groom her after few strokes ! only downsides this product : 1 . small size - it doesn't hold much fur so either all fur ends up floor or you emptying it every few strokes2 . " front " versus " back " positions - cats not generally stay one place , i three they roll walk around while i groom them . it bit unconvenient constantly switch brush my left right hand get proper angle de-shed my kitties . i don't know how this could improved but it downside product . overall it defineitely worth 10 bucks i spent , my boo-boo never lets me groom her anything else	1
i owned one these little wonders over five years . during time i replaced lightbulb one time , which extent maintenance or repairs light required . people who complaining light feels " flimsy " , you tried tightening series screws allow you adjust tension various parts light ? it designed allow this sort adjustment , but if you never tighten screws they eventually get loose . imagine ! it moving part ! seriously , maybe they've switched different supplier ( although i doubt it ) , but my light joy . it proven durable over countless trips , moves , drops . it provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse sleep undisturbed beside you . plus , unlike so many designs market , it very lightweight . some designs inexplicably batteries housed unit , so batteries weigh down your book while you read . i just don't understand all negative reviews this product . only thing i suggest : try tightening those screws periodically . it make world difference	1
this kettle amazing . it simple -- you plug it flip switch ( light turns let you know it working ) . it heats very quickly , lt ; 5 minutes full kettle boiling water if you only want cup or two tea , it heats 3 . students dorms , you use it oatmeal , soup , tea . automatically cuts off after boiling minute , so no worries fire hazards . great product , i use it every day .	1

hb 31602 excellent raclette grill price well below most other raclettes market now . this my second grill ; first - swiss-made machine - died after 10 years use . i decided try hb because its features attractive price , well my previous favorable experience amazon event i wanted return item . short , unit functions perfectly . its variable temperature control ( must raclette cooking ) its job well . clean up - frequent gripe among raclette grill reviewers - breeze .... assuming you only use top grill cook normal raclette-type foods such small potatoes , sausages or canadian bacon , not frying eggs , you treat non-stick surface properly . although listing copy doesn't make this clear , unit comes both rectangular pans plastic scrapers . cord length ( often-heard complaint ) quite adequate . only potential shortcoming way item shipped -- its retail box only , way you would pick it up store . means only thing your grill rough world ups trip few pieces egg-carton packing flimsy , non-corrugated box .... recipe disaster . fortunately , my unit arrived ok though box pretty beat up . amazon should require its third party ' partners ' use shipping cartons , like amazon itself always . ( positive side , my one experience amazon re shipping-damaged item very satisfactory .	1
i've my h-b step savor skillet/griddle several months now , i am very happy it . griddle accomodates four medium-sized pancakes , small lip around edge keeps batter off my countertops . skillet gets hot enough brown hamburger meat enough capacity prepare substantial main dish family 4-6 . temperature control temperature markings both griddle skillet , since skillet temperature runs lower than griddle . clean-up easier than traditional electric skillets . you don't need worry immersing electrical components because skillet lifts off base ( which griddle ) washed like any non-stick cookware . griddle wipes clean paper towel or damp sponge . though i'm not much home entertaining , i imagine this electric skillet very handy -- you cook it , then turn temperature down keep food warm long you need . lid adjustable vent it control moisture level inside . i only wish non-stick coating bit tougher . i've careful avoid scratches so far , but i know it only matter time . i just hope h-b keeps making these clever kitchen tools , because when this one becomes unusable , i'll certainly buy one	1
i purchased this item based other reviews i am not sorry i made purchase several reasons . i love lodge cast iron , amazon best prices anywhere free shipping . however , i taken aback size this skillet . it huge ! i tried it my gas range it takes up front back burners but adjustments needed keep sides burning . if it used just front burner ( larger burner ) flame directed middle pan but there so much skillet left over outer edges never get really hot . i would think 13inch skillet ( which i just purchased also ) would make more reasonable purchase becuase it 12 which might too small 15 1/4 which toooooo big	1
we live new york city two cats - younger cats , 18 months year old - needless say , it would really nice if we could rid ourselves litter box forever . we originally purchased cat toile t-t raining system company - it not nearly good this one , fact , it total failure - flimsy plastic , you couldn't punch out insert gradually like you this one . this point we almost there - we punched out half insert , cats acually perching toilet seat aiming hole - just incredible . we very happy ! plastic strong easy clean -	1

this worst vacuum we ever . it doesn't pick up pet hair - what heck ? it doesn't bare floors , it sucks up chews up persian rugs , it self propelled ? you got kidding me ! i push this thing harder than any vacuum ever . i went wal mart lowes get new belt it , this 4th belt we gone through one year neither places it . now what ? it very heavy vacuum . bringing it upstairs nearly kills ya . it far loudest vacuum there , super loud droning sound sends animals wild each time you turn it . small room it absolutely deafening ! i hate it , i not recommend it . if someone here - they lying you ! this worst vacuum we owned . i visibly see dust dirt shoot out back when i vacuum ( even after cleaning it out ) so much hepa filter!!!don't buy this vacuum , you want throw it through window like i even my husband wants !!	-1
this probably sturdiest bottle opener i've ever used . it opens pretty much any bottle ease , leverage easy due its bulk size . you probably won't ever lose it , either , since it so big . it definitely not travel because its weight , so you'll want something else if you plan bring bottle opener picnics or camping trips	1

i some research pans because i wanted some christmas replace old ones . i 10 inch skillet , 4.5 quart sauce 5 quart oval pans they best pans i've ever owned . what i love them ? 1 . mine not any sticking issues what so ever . 2 . they clean extremely easy fast via hand washing ( no hard scrubbing all ) . 3 . since it only takes seconds clean , i reuse cook something else without any flavor previous meal . 4 . handles not get hot they good non-slip grip ( i silicone rubber handles ) . 5 . they apparently put oven up 350 degrees but i not tried yet . 6 . they not heavy some professional ones . i would recommend buying this brand . conif i say anything bad them , only thing i think rivets inside pan attach handle pan get food stuck around them so you really clean around area good . i wish they would just attached handle outside pan	1
this not only peppermill i own , but it only one i'll use . i hate admit it , but i walked into dining room retrieve this baby even though perfectly usable mill right kitchen cupboad front me . i not intend become such peppermill snob but this such well designed tool i no longer settle using old ones . all previous mill suffered similar problems which oxo solved . maryland , humidity always problem peppermills . not this one . through dog days august , when other mills just mashing peppers into gummy paste clogging point where you gladly settle year old ground pepper , this mill produces talc fine powder . i've read other people trouble getting fine grind . you cannot just crank down adjustment nut get fine grind . your turn crank counter clockwise you tighten adjuster . this helps clear mechanism . if you don't this , larger peppercorns block mechanism closing down all way . once you get hang how adjust this mill , it provide copiuous quantities pepper extra cource super fine . easy grip handle eliminates all wasted motion associated tradional mill . i make my own barbeque rub always hated grinding enough pepper recipe . most mills only grind correctly one direction . so , you twist knob , release it reposition your grip twist again . half your motion wasted . now , thanks easy grip handle i crank out tablespoons pepper seconds . when i'm , i set mill back it clip-on base so there no pepper dust my spice cabinet . if you believe form follows function , this beautiful tool . if you need more status you peppermill get solid walnut mill or brushed aluminum mill manufacturer . just don't expect it out perform this classic .	1

this toaster definitely space saver . there few things you need know get great food out it though , toast i turn oven before i get bread out so it good temp when i put slices . if you want bake something or toast baguette sandwich just use bottom burner . i like how shelves come out when you open door , it makes retrieving your food so much easier . all all , it takes few tries adjust this toaster oven , but it makes up initial awkward period so cute small . i'm very happy my purchase .	1
if you're all clad chef , you know quality . accept no substitute splatter screen . i tired wiping up grease splatters all over my stovetop , around dials , floor , etc ... cheap flat screens just don't stay pan . edges all clad screen make it foolproof staying place . handle design saves space storage . one size fits everything up 13 inches . screen high quality design , not window screen gets punctured sooner or later . i tell this screen never bend out shape either . yes , it more expensive than cheap flat ones , but you'll appreciate performance durability advantages	1

i purchased this diamond sharpening steel amazon used it couple days . it really works superb overall performance above all expectations . it not only realigns edge but sharpens it well . i.e. it removes material ( steel ) infinitesimal amount accumulates surface tool extremely fine dust . it takes only few effortless strokes simple edge realignment if knife sharp or few minutes work if knife dull . but any case , result amazing ! once while this diamond sharpening steel should put under running water only few seconds cleaning steel dust residue flushes water . maintenance simple easy . so , whether you cheap knives or expensive ones this tool worth money . only issue i leave open durability this diamond sharpening steel . theoretically it should last forever but reality it remains seen .	1

this makes very good starter set me because i only needed replace 3 knives i use everyday my cutlery set . i am not great chef but using these knives seemed make me feel close one because it sharpness smoothness . i believe saying quot ; you get what you pay forquot ; . first i thought these bit expensive my simple lifestyle but once i've started using them , i felt good cooking . cutting carrots , slicing tomatoes meat breeze , my wrist felt lighter . that when i know i made right choice	1

this item works advertised . but they don't tell you glove designed fit either hand . so go ahead get two . you need them both lift heavy dishes out oven . they're much more reliable than regular pot holders slip when you're trying retrieve dish oven . glove may little tight man large hands . i medium size hands glove fairly tight me	1
i adore good china , but too many young children use it often . graduated out plastic plates cups phase needed train my children ( who , course , break lots plates while ) while simultaneously pleasing myself . i thought this impossible , until i found this setting . it not too fancy , but understated simply elegant . this bodes well its power remain pleasing eyes after passage time . i it now one year . i am pleased report it very robust ( not like bone china , but very strong thin stoneware ) . my five children , all whom pre-pubescent , only broken one plate . i continue appreciate its clean , simple elegance . this one enduring flagship patterns mikasa continue make perpetuity , also , so i am confident broken pieces easily replaced foreseeable future . pattern shipped me suffered one broken tea cup serving platter , which promptly replaced without question cost me mikasa . i think you can't go wrong this purchase	1

this makes best waffes , it perfect single person or couple because it only makes 2 time . i haven't tried making those pocket sandwiches yet , but soon . i love how non-stick grates pop out go into dishwasher - what timesaver ! this exceptional value great appliance	1
i bought this it keep me running outside trash twice day . still , my 2 cats must produce whole lot waste because refill cartridges don't seem last more than 2 3 weeks i litterlocker fills up 2 or 3 times week . still , it good job concealing odors i pretend i don't indoor cats cleanings . if i could improve it : refills would last longer container would little bit biggerthe blade cutting bags would sharper i'd add little barrier hole where waste goes so kitty litter isn't easily spilled out when you dump it inoverall , i'm glad i bought it . it wouldn't big enough storage more than 2 cats , it , my two give it run its money . i guess i should just glad my cats regular leave it . ;)	1
this fan not only stylish beautiful , it powerful quiet , too . i am very happy this purchase	1
perhaps like you , i love silicone . this large spatula quite nice . you anything silicone . you fry , poach , make soups , there never worry heat . le crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils , but their wood unfinished , so unless you keep them oiled , they age spilter . these you remove top if you like but wooden handles treated , water resistant . addition these made long hall , their shape unique . i like shape slightly angled , this makes it easier run edges bowl . i so happy my purchase these ! i can't say enough good things them . i would recommend these over other manufactors , they better made , improve others weaker areas . must your kitchen	1

poor folks who complaining " eee " display , i haven't same problems . customer support this really professional prompt 800 number . " eee " problem result people not reading instructions not immersing control panel water . don't it . panel electronic electronics don't work when they're filled water . this unit good , solid fryer which i've no problems . pros : easy use , easy clean up . nothing baked my frier or my friends friers ( death eee ) . even when frying " trouble " items like pastry or breaded items , basket comes clean easilly . controls positive engagement hard accidentally push . unit makes loud beeping when buttons pushed distinctive alarm . you shouldn't leave frier unattended , but you enough peace-of-mind you work other things kitchen while fryer working . bonus suggested cooking tempetures printed right unit so when manual gets lost , you some idea what what . window also lifesaver it lets you see what oil doing just case anything goes wrong . cons : power chord most annoying bit plugged upside down . don't it . it says " this side up " clearly chord , but if you absent minded or limited eyesight , this might issue . only other problem controls ( power button ) faces frying basket . this more pet-peeve then anything but if you need get control unit hurry , you not want reaching through hot oil splatter . my suggestion : keep it it own power strip so you yet button case emergency . sadly , this gripe applies almost all friers . i also wish lid bit better designed , lid drops inevitable condensation water into oil until you get used tipping it out ( towards basket handle ) . once you get hang it , condensation dropping into oil avoided . this frier , despite few minor shortcomings , excellent . one nice features it heats up quickly maintain heat even when adding pulling out food . caution when oil disagreeable , it heats up quickly . sure supervise frier . i managed boneheaded thing chopping up mushrooms , washing them , tossing them without thinking it managed cause quite show kitchen . i actually read manual , there blurb there make sure food completely thawed dried which i not heed . if you respect power here , it great unit	1
i got set because photo looked good . when they arrived , i felt molding ridges stem ( but mostly they ground off foot ) , saw wavy distortions bowls uneven glass thickness shape . these aspects bothered me so much i returned glasses . you must decide where you want quality vs . price spectrum , but aware these much worse quality than , instance , hungarian blown glasses williams-sonoma	1

i bought this item through target via amazon . similar other recent purchasers , i problems motor/base not working all , notified target replacement . however , i same problem replacement unit , after some fiddling around , able get new unit working . trick seems " gears " connect bottom bowl top motor/base . they need " just so " motor turn . must some kind safety feature . since figuring this out , machine worked great . fairly quiet operation relatively simple clean up ( bowl attachments go directly dishwasher ) . i would give it 5 stars except frustrating front end work - it shouldn't complicated ! very least , directions should warn proper assembling needed machine turn	1

riedel o series wine tumblers great value more practical many occasions than traditional wine glasses because they lack potentially fragile stem . these pinot noir/nebbiolo glasses great not only those two varietals , but also beaujolais other wines made gamay grape . i also happen think these could work " general purpose " red wine glasses , if you should so choose use them such . these great all but most formal occasions , should really enhance your wine tasting experience , whether you wine novice or expert taster .	1

my wife i drink more coffee than we probably should . this cuisinart coffee maker brews full pot just few minutes . it taste great . i really like how easy it take everything apart place parts my dishwasher . coffee pot not spill water all over place when filling machine like so many other brands i've experienced past . although i rated this coffee maker 5-star , there one little thing i don't care much . machine stays 2-hours before auto shut-off shuts it off . whereas most others turn off one hour . but very minor . if you like perfect tasting coffee hurry , this machine you . if size scares you , just let you know , it fits perfectly under my upper cabinets when counter top . it little larger than standard 12-cup machine , but not much . it looks real nice also . when i finally wear this coffee maker out , i'll buy just like it . oh , it takes standard #4 cone shaped filters , or you use copper filter it comes . usual , amazon cheapest price i could find	1

heftier inner bowl this particular model people hunting all over place it when sizes smaller larger passed over . rice cooker fine job replaces our humongous panasonic 10 cupper . this one take forever cook . oh , yes : paddle bottom underneath packaging . i thought i missing it especially since i got ripped box ripped manual so i emailed got replacement paddle sanyo before i found original one during recycling . ooops ! unlike all previous panasonics , there not magnetic handle cup place rice paddle . pity . panasonic magnet won't stick this either so i always designated place rice paddle . we own rice cooker make our daily rice because designated machine less stressful . you need rice cooker ? no . steaming rice pyrex bowl certainly faster would require leaving burner low keep rice warm until you ready eat it . but there something compartmentalizing rice cooking part one day removes it constant consideration . p.s. we usually make two cups rice per meal there enough height remaining me place 4-cup round pyrex bowl some savory food warm . two months daily use later , i recommend this product because rice comes out fine but it take 35 (!!!) minutes . if you want faster rice , then steam rice rack pot . made chinai use this all time . this frugal ? no but it much less hassle than pressure cooker it made perfect long grain , short grain basmati rice first gowould i purchased this used cheaper price off craigslist ? nodid i shop around best total price including manufacturer website ? yes so should yo	1

cast iron usually isn't my first choice cookware several reasons : it isn't non-stick ; it heavy ( i tendonitis my hands ); it can't go dishwasher . thankfully , lodge new enamel-coated line takes care most these issues ! i recently got my hands one their two-quart enamel-coated casserole dishes review , apple green . i love wide , shallow design . after all , many casseroles wind up browned , crusty toppings -- which best part ! -- this allows more casserole come out way . i also find this little easier lift , particularly because wide handles , although you definitely need both hands i still let my husband move it out oven most par t.t wo quarts barely enough most casseroles , i find ; i usually prefer dishes two half quarts just because they allow little more room error help avoid spill-overs . however , i think most reasonably-sized casseroles fit this . quality enamel coating part what i love most lodge enamel-coated line . past i've used le creuset enamel-coated cast iron ( bought quite while ago , so if they've improved their coating recent years i can't address ) it definitely inferior . it wasn't slick , so it didn't clean easily nor release food easily . it also didn't stand up all well metal utensils . contrast , it hard imagine this coating wearing down any time soon . we made cornbread it it slid out pan without any help all . i love way this pan heats evenly , holds heat keeps casserole warm until you come back seconds , releases food ease , cleans like charm despite fact you should wash it hand . it elegant , wide shallow design perfect giving you more browned topping that so delicious most casseroles , it makes niftiest oval loaf cornbread . what more could you want ? well okay , i wish it could go dishwasher general principle , i wish they could come up way make cast iron lighter those us hand problems , i wish it held just little bit more . but good conscience i only take half point off those , so consider my rating 4.5	1

( unless he left it oven many , many hours 500 degrees ! ) i've used mine four or five times now without incident . ( my sister , who gave me this , also set used it great success well . ) i feeling this guy either writing accidentally wrong brand name , or just lying order fuel his weird neocon agenda , which no place amazon . if you love bake ... you'll really heaven this calphalon set . if you not much baker ( like me ) this liable turn you into one ! enjoy ! oh , send me muffin	1

( there reason cooking show chefs all use stainless ) . just remember use lower heat than you normally since these pans seem heat up faster hotter	1
i bought this because i liked idea water filter inside . you can't find replacement filters . you can't measure water correctly . i tried just pouring water cup . didn't work because it goes right into water filter so it looks like it level 3 when it more . last straw other day water started brew through basket , basket sprang open . i water everywhere . it also seems take while brew small pot coffee . i usually made 3 or 4 cup pot it took 8 minutes . i never buy coffee pot this company again .	-1

i apologize reviewing product i don't own , never owned , won't ever own or need . general , i'm against doing this , but this case i feel really compelled comment what appears gimmick , hopefully dissuade some people wasting their money it . here my take this product -- it pizza stone thermometer backsplash . i can't imagine backsplash any practical use , thermometer , let put it this way : if your grill nice enough it capable generating or containing heat necessary emulate brick oven pizza , it probably one . even if it doesn't , you buy one separately under 10 bucks , free use it anywhere your kitchen or grill area . here what i recommend . go buy bona fide pizza stone , or better yet , few unglazed ceramic tiles home depot few bucks . way , you prepare more than one pizza simultaneously under $99 per pizza . my advice you , should , put rig like this together your own price large pepperoni domino . don't waste your money or your precious kitchen storage space this thing	1
i needed saucepan cook oatmeal would let go bits stick bottom . sounds silly , but i love oatmeal hate cleaning pan afterwards . this cleans up easily cooks evenly . i used it cooking rice , gravies other foods seem stick it always cleans up well . now , lid . there black band inside lid it scrubed off one night recently . i sat down , wrote email company next day , they new lid way . they asked only where send it , nothing else . i like companies stand product they sell . so , if you going buy this line , check black band , it should glass metal , not inside lid . if you problem product , always notify manufacturer , they almost always make it right , like calphalon me	1

i'm going against what many home chefs like all purpose knife . it not heavy , german , or made surgical stainless steel . these light knives , picking them up effortless . if you uses knives often , why get something heavy promotes carpal tunnel syndrome ? they not german . i think german knives overated overpriced . these knives great bargain . you get 2 whole sets cost one henckels or wusthoff knife . i admit cheaper steel they use these knives not hold their edge long nor you dishwash ( always handwash these ) . these knives rust if you throw them machine but they very easy sharpen get ridiculously sharp using those cheap 2 stage knife sharpeners . long you handwash sharpen periodically , you cut best them . secret caring your knife handwash , light oil cloth , sharpen your knives periodically .	1

mario batali lasagna pan best pan i've used . it extra deep so it holds really thick layers all good stuff i make my lasagnas . it weighs ton since it enameled cast iron , but why it cooks so evenly . i recommend adding 15+ minutes extra cooking time your recipes because oven heat heavy mass pan . cleaning easy . just soak it hot sudsy water while then all baked cheese sauce wipe off kitchen scrub pad . only surprises rim pan no enamel . it bare iron . but it cleaned without problem not rust when soaked overnight . this great pan , but it very heavy when empty even heavier when filled lasagna so make sure you've got some stong helpers around put it oven if necessary . :o	1

i used love this kettle . i've this kettle over four years now it developed same problem some people who gave it one-star reviews . electrical contacts degraded over past few months today i couldn't get it turn all no matter how many times i twisted it around its base . i've cleaned contacts twice past few months no avail . maybe improvement all day each time . looking inside base , i see why contacts die -- they don't grip metal ring spike all , but rather ring spike just rest loosely sprung metal . wish i'd thought inspect before buying i t.t here no excuse such bad design . they hoping repeat buy ? not going happen	-1
buying these types things problematical . one can't know how they work until they're tried out one own work space . things consider height width your open shelf areas . this wrap holder get way accessing things shelf below . addition hooks sit shelf above interfere what you put shelf . so keep this mind . holder works okay overall . i got two could only fit one into my main pantry . if i'd space , better solutions would : larger vertical unit installed inside cupboard or pantry door or full depth wire drawer screwed underneath shelf	1
this item " must " !! it light weight , cleans well . i love it	1
i started out liking this machine , despite not so fond our former dirt devil " screamer " ridiculous belt changing routine . problems this machine : try cleaning pleated filter ( good luck ! ) exhaust blowing out sides then slightly downward blows around what you're trying vacuum up . i am really surprised no one else mentioned these two issues ( except one person who mentioned filter ) . after just one use , i knock pleated filter against trash loosen remove dirt -- no go . so what options ? leave dirt there continually clog it , then forced go buy new one $5.99 ? i honestly think this goal dirt devil , just make extra buck . if you're trying vacuum up pet hair , anything light weight , watch it blow around exhaust you go chasing it vacuum ( utterly futile ) . it loud side too . it powerful , but wrong way -- goal vacuum up debris , not blow it around your house	1
pepper casserole very cute , but i prefer wider , shallower shape pumpkin casserole which i also own . small , deep pepper tends cook some dishes unevenly due shape . instance , i used this casserole bake egg custard . end recommended cooking time middle remained liquid . time center firm , edges dry amp ; overcooked . this same dish cooks perfectly pumpkin . i find i use pumpkin far more frequently due superior baking results i've achieved it	1
i bought one these few months ago but unfortunately it spends lot more time my kitchen drawer than my regular garlic press . here what i like it : 1 . idea whacking unpeeled clove garlic order take skin off more easily great , but this any hard , flat object or even side chef knife blade . 2 . unlike garlic press , garlic twist gives you uniform pieces chopped garlic . while garlic press leaves you flattened skin you either discard or chop up hand , garlic twist gives you uniform pieces . unfortunately , this where garlic press wins out my standards , it difficult my lady-like hands " get garlic twist going . " after garlic gone through few destructive twists , it simple enough continue until you reach desired size chunks . however , first few twists quite difficult execute , you press two parts together quite hard , while simultaneously turning them , keep them popping apart jumping over garlic rather than punching through it . this problem occurs even just one clove . interesting idea , but classic garlic press still my favorite . sometimes i grate garlic ginger grater or microplane grater . larger quantities , zyliss chopper might job but i've never tried . garlic twist , however , drawbacks out-weigh advantages	1
this solid , basic stainless pressure cooker , quite bargain $41.45 price ( or $33 something after $25 off $125 kitchen purchases ) . advantages : * easy use flip pressure regulator quick release pressure * only 15 lbs pressure adequate normal pressure cooking * handles both sides makes cooker easy carry stable when full . * stainless won't interact food product such tomatoes . * 8 qt . capacity gives 4 qts capacity when cooking foaming products such beans or lentils . * easier clean than some pressure cookers i used . disadvantages : * only cooks 15 lbs pressure , where some recipes call only 10 lbs would adjusted . * most canning 10 lbs pressure sealevel up 1000 ft elevation * i respectfully disagree this cooker meant canning . it could process 3 or 4 pints pinch , but 23 qt pressure cooker canning workhorse hold 19 pts or 7 qts . manual suggests not canning it , it doesn't canning trivet included . * it much lighter weight than older presto models , so i don't know if it last long old ones . overall , it great pressure cooker most cooking , very good value	1

pros : low price , looks good package , adequately slices dices small pieces meat thin veggies . cons : flexible thin blade , extremely lightweight , air pockets too small effective -- veggies stick blade . conclusion : if you regularly need use santoku knife , spend little more buy something more weight/heft deeper dimples . this more like disposable knife you might take vacation or use pinch .	1

i bought this little wonder , one my niece one me . i lots tile my home . my niece hard wood floors tile kitchen bathrooms , carpet bedrooms . i bought dirt devil swifter rechargable vac , but it won't space rugs you hold down switch keep vacuum working . i bought it because it light . i got tired holding switch . i arthritis . new one swifter hadn't come out yet . so , desperation , i bought flair . it great ! change outlet because cord too short even my kitchen , it big , but that only draw back . i go tile space rugs tile infinitely . it electric not battery powered . i keep roller or turn it off switch right there top handle . i wash filter , don't buy new ones . cup small , but all i empty it . who wants keep cup dust dirt around , anyway--that just plain lazy . it such good strong vacuum , my niece even cleans carpet doorways . she says this little vacuum better than her bigger vacuum(not hoover ) , but i told her this little wonder lighter work areas than heavy carpet . happy cleaning	1
board right size carving up whole chicken " moat " , while modest width/depth , kept counters clean . plus it reasonably light its size . one small surprise me wood so very dry . it soaked up two very generous applications mineral oil very quickly . if it doesn't come oiling instructions , you'll still want oil it soon possible perhaps multiple applications each spaced out day . new comments : after seasoning board , hand washing , 6 months happy use , board split glued joint . this happened after it sitting counter week under weight homemade loaf bread medium-weight glass cake cover . my best guess board become just slightly ( most imperceptively ) warped constant distributed weight provided enough stress crack apart glue overnight -- 6+ " it ! i know nothing woodworking but i doubt seasoning alone strengthen joint or prevent minor warpage . so i'm lowering product 3 star rating	1

like several other reviews , i very dissapointed . we looked several machines francisfrancis !, gaggia ascaso . while these certainly more expensive machines , machine we replacing price parity breville . my observations : pros : solid well built constructionlong steamer wand . this allows you rest your carafe unit steam your milk while you put away dish or toast bagelsimple operate pleasant look atnice ergonomic features like storage compartment accessories under unit , removable foam wand , etc . consit fails horribly its core function , making good expresso steaming/foaming your milk . i use pods machine takes very long pull shot , it splattered all over ( due funky way they try " create " crema ) , ultimate product weak bitterthe steam very weak , took 30% longer warm up my machine than any machine we tested , it very inconsistent how much steam it injected . machine wastes lot water . they proud all priming purging features , but it steams belches it makes quite mess . i found myself reaching sponge towel several times during brewing process . net this great machine architecturally but horrid expresso maker . if this kind coffee acceptable you , there thousand less expensive brands trick . price , performance must better .	1
good quality lamp price . kind dark color but very sleek sophisticated . 3-way lighting also good feature . i'm very satisfied overall	1
my husband thinks small appliances waste counterspace money . i don't always disagree , but we make press pot coffee twice day heating up water stove took 15+ minutes there always floating sediment bottom our kettle ... sounds appetizing ! i researched this kettle liked description water boiled quickly turned off automatically .... i also wanted it retain heat able taken off heating source serving . my husband ( i ) really like this pot . we use it not only coffee ( full pot boiling takes just under 5 minutes ) but boil water pasta other cooking . it saves me time i don't want kitchen all night .... this one small appliance we not want without . only change i would make handle seems bit large average hand so it not comfortable hold i still sediment ... which probably problem my water . least now i get into pot clean through large opening . no weird smells here we using daily 6 months	1

i bought this set my wife christmas , mainly because i stuck ideas what get her . she spends lot time kitchen she using old set chicago cutlery several unbranded cheap giveaway knives several years . none those knives great or sharp i hated trying put edge them even though i'm pretty good sharpening knives . essentially , knives just sharpened pieces steel appear pretty simple , straightforward instruments shouldn't difficult produce . but little experience some poor examples prove this not case . like most seemingly simple things , simplicity illusion . my experience not kitchen knives but it " working " knives . pocket knives fixed blade knives designed hard use nasty jobs i daily removing staples papers office chopping down woody weeds backyard cutting up boxes , rope , cording thin pieces aluminum . i know value blade take good edge hold it through lot abuse . i little research found several brands kitchen knives universal respect . wusthof always or near top everyone list . more often than not , it number one reviews surveys i came across . my wife little apprehensive sharpness knives out box . she quickly realized value really sharp kitchen knife , no time , she commenting how much easier it work wusthof than cheapo knives she using . she really making good use paring knife chef knife days since christmas . my own limited use chef knife this set confirms how well it handles cuts compared clunky chicago cutlery chef knife . after looking over more reviews , i've ordered wusthof 7 " hollow edge santoku go this set . designed thin cuts , it fit well other knives . i'll probably also get serrated edge bread knife no t-t oo-distant future round out wusthof set . this likely lifetime purchase our household makes high price more investment . i'm well pleased so my wife .	1
product stapled together . doesn't seem consistent quality other wusthof products	-1

product not without its flaws , but if your cat likes mindlessly chasing same thing over over this toy them . generally you need set it small shelf , table or desk aim it floor ( it only 2 settings where aim it ) . you're supposed able open it it start up , my unit little " funny " day 1 i open it , let it snap shut hard then it would turn then opening it second time it ready . once you start it up it runs 5-9 minutes . laser spins fast large circle ( depending how high up you place device ) couple seconds , then stops second , then repeats . every time it stops different place , typically few inches previous stopping point . it works out very well cats they try predict where it " land " . i would say this good toy turn right before you leave so cats play wear themselves out sleep while you're gone instead getting into trouble while you're away . it especially popular dumber cats group , because it repetitive . ( or maybe their hunting instinct easier trigger	1

first let me say this product arrived my home faster then i expected , especially since it right before christmas . product itself great . i just purchased new , very expensive wooden cutting board i wanted sure protect it . someone store where i bought board suggested i get " food grade mineral oil " . i really no idea this type product but once i started searching web info , i found it best thing use keep your wooden boards like new years . i unable locate any this oil stores i go normally so i turned my tried true friend , amazon.com sure enough , they this product . once i began using it , i could tell right away what difference it made how my new cutting board looked . i typically use my board every day using oil once week . board stayed " fresh " looking no lasting cut marks no water damage after wash ups	1

we put these knives our wedding registry after reading cooks illustrated kitchen knife review . they most highly recommended these set high-end wustoff knives . we chose these because they're much better value ( when these go sale , you pick up whole victorinox set same price one good wustoff knife ) . we've very happy our choice ( our friends who bought them us -- gotta love registries ! ) . blades very sharp , knives very well-balanced comfortable hand , everything very easy clean . we've our set few months now blades still sharp day we got ' em . physical design knives very functional . they aren't quite sharp heavier forged metal blades some higher end knives like fancier wustoffs . these stamped sheet metal rather than individually forged . but they're still very good , much better value than their forged competitors . one note : we bit confused difference forschner victorinox versions this knife set . but it turns out they're exact same knives , just distributed under two different labels . forschner brand name they've used years sell professional chefs . they only recently started selling under victorinox name attempt reach home gourmets , under theory people already associate victorinox name quality . but we victorinox version , they're exactly same my friend forschners . so you buy either ( whichever cheaper )	1

this grill comes handy middle michigan winter when we can't fire up our outdoor bbq . it cooks quickly cleans fairly easily . i never dared place it dishwasher , although it sounds like lot people so i might try it . there few downfalls - you get grease splatters countertop no matter how careful you if you like your meat medium-well prepared crack window open because ' burnt ' smell linger days otherwise	1

i agree mr. vasicek review most part , other reviewer below who mentioned problems clock . i got this pot because it would more difficult break than ones glass carafes , lack burner meant no more burnt coffee . i problem filter flopping over getting grinds my coffee , may try permanent filter solution . i definitely recommend pre-heating carafe hot water , regardless time year . otherwise coffee gets tepid fast . coffee not hot it could , most time , but maybe that also amount ( also preheated ) milk i put my cup . i don't like delayed brew function , but only because it time-based , like alarm clock , i'd rather it straight delay , because i don't make coffee same time every morning -- i'd like able set it go off after set time , so i could go outside , or shower , or whatnot , return fresh coffee . but it doesn't really matter , because clock itself seems bit wonky now i've appliance few months . i can't say whether we've bumping it accidentally changing time , or whether there problem clock itself ; anyway , it seems weak point . i've cleaned it few times white vinegar ; i can't get all coffee stains out carafe but i don't really care . i don't drip problem pouring coffee , but i line lid arrow up carefully found it helps steady lid when you pour . if you try pour without lid , it often spill ! but compared pouring out little glass carafes " freebie " type coffee makers , this one great . forget pause function ... if you take carafe out during brew cycle you just asking trouble . all all , i'd say it not " perfect coffee maker " but it most suitable i encountered recent years -- speaking someone who recently ruined percolator running it without water . i would buy this one again	1

this heater works reasonably well , it not too noisy low setting , but it electronic control designed extremely bad . first all it three operational modes : low , high auto . low uses half its heating power runs fan slower quieter speed . high - uses full power noisiest . thermostat setting/operation not available nether under low nor under high mode . auto mode you set desired temperature heater reasonably good job maintaining set temperature , but - when it auto mode heater runs it full power becomes noisy . there no way make use thermostat low heating power . i think most people would actually want use auto mode low power , especially if they use heater bedroom , but some genius delonghi decided save few cents not providing this option . heater also ' forgets ' your last auto temperature setting after you switch it off defaults 75 , so every time you switch it again you adjust temperature - pretty annoying imo . spite fact i got it pretty cheap ( under 40 ) , it going back .	1

i wanted pressure cooker some time , recently received this one gift . i used it number times since getting it , it becoming my favorite cooking utensil . since getting it , i cooked : - beans ( less than 25 minutes perfect texture no presoaking)- chicken ( 25 minutes fall-of-the bone tenderness)- roast ( most tender , juicy best tasting my family eaten)a 10-quart cooker may somewhat larger than many people think they need . i love large size because i cook family or company don't worry not enough room . this simple use , easy clean way delicious food family hurry . taking chiken out refrigerator dinner table often less than 40 minutes . while this also true other pressure cookers , fagor splendid cooker easy use locking mechanisms , it simple design makes it reliable easy clean . couple suggestions : read instructions . while this cooker simple use clean , instructions contain number very useful hints . i read instructions beforehand , my first dish would less hassle than it . second , buy accessories . this pot just pot - no trivet , no basket , no spoons , nothing else . serious pressure cooking , you need some these other utensils . final comment : you won't get better this price . i recommend this any serious cook who limited time	1
this things * * work , although fan doesn't blow heated air very far away unit . it possible adjust thermostat knob so it keeps your room right temperature , but when it reaching temperature you've set , it switches off constantly . ( like 20 times 10 seconds -- seriously . ) i'm not sure this one isn't slightly defective , since most thermostat controls non-switching region where they don't change their state long temperature within certain range . instance , if you set your furnace thermostat 68 , it turns furnace 67 , not 67.992 turns it off 69 , not 68.002 . this apparently doesn't feature -- it literally runs less than 1/10th second regular basis . i wonder how long thermostat relay last constant cycling .	1

i just recently received this odor eliminator . it much bigger than i expected but very easy setup use . filters relatively cheap only need purchased every 2 months . whisper quiet mode well unit just whisper quiet . if you trying get rid particularly bad smell you turn it high speed which moderately noisy fan noise . living dorm sometimes things get bit smelly ( if you know what i mean ) . this device always your back whether it your garbage you don't want take out or your room mate pile smelly clothes . this modern age we don't always time take care these things most sprays simply mask odors . this great hamilton beach product eliminates odors sends them packing	1

this little unit heats two our children rooms ( 10x8 12x14 ) perfectly ! their rooms normally around 63 degrees while house 66 , this unit elevate them 75-80 degrees very little effort . i know because i used electric thermometer measure temperature . don't expect this unit completely heat room without presence central home heating unit . meaning , this unit not heat small cabinet middle wood itself . but if you central heating ( baseboard or central-air ) keep temperature low save gas bills this perfect unit ! it made complement them . only thing i wish it digital thermometer so i set it exact temperature instead doing it feel . but then , it so inexpensive i can't really complain ..	1

first all , let me say i agree reviewer who deducted stars 9 " skillet due non-stick coating . since non-stick coatings chemicals , i refuse use any cooking utensil coating them . original , baked enamel finish this skillet works great . secret using moderate heat adding oil once pan warms up , then adding food items . if meat sticks , it unstick it carmelizes ( this also applies their grilling skillets ) . i find i just wipe mine out keep using it until i make chili or something messy like . then all i fill skillet water let it sit while , then it rinses clean . maximum , i've taken boar bristle brush couple spots once or twice , that all . i beseech this company leave non-stick coating off their skillets even though one reviewer below seems prefer it . or minimum give consumer choice but i'd bet most would prefer original , satin finish . fact , i bought this skillet because fired enamel finish i discovered my well-known name brand stainless steel skillet stew/pasta pot too much nickel them so i can't use them . anyway , i love this skillet . it makes good wok too burner under center pan . i fry up one veggie , push it off side where it stays warm while i fry next one , then push it over until i'm finished . i say i loved this skillet ? i wish they made lid this skillet i buy brand which doesn't match but it works . since most skillets come without lids , this silly , i agree . so then , i highly recommend this skillet both cooking easy clean-up	1

this deepest lasagna pan i able find , why i bought it . i owned it several years , but i don't bake or roast often . it worked adequately . i gotten my money worth . because it stainless steel , it feels lightweight . it not made thick metal , therefore feels just little cheap . gourmet cooks might sneer it . stainless steel , it shows no signs rust , even handles , after soaking kitchen sink . exterior still looks nice . interior not any kind non-stick coating . spatula/turner/flipper utensil , which comes pan , very useful . it thin enough slide under food turned over skillet . it little flexible , but not extremely flexible like some wimpy spatulas . it won't flex , wiggle , collapse while carrying something heavy like say thick pork chop . i use spatula very frequently . it thin enough slide under fresh-baked soft cookies , remove them pan , without making mess cookies . rack put inside pan , fits nicely , use when roasting meat . rack not very high , so it would not adequate roasting something extremely high fat , such goose , would result deep layer melted fat bottom pan . rack also used cooling rack baked goods , although not intended such . wires not spaced close together ideal cooling rack , thus small cookies may fall through .	1

2006 year specialty roombas . their " high end upgrade " this year intellibin option their top line model , scheduler . we 2 schedulers love them , so i intrigued this intelli-bin . however , extra $20 , i actually consider this bad feature , not good feature . here why . essence you get exact same robot scheduler robot , which i love . however , they added one light , which tells you if bin full . theory here you'll clean it when you see light . however this awful theory ! roombas need kept clean run well . even if there only little dirt there , if it hair wrapped around something you leave it there , it going wrap more more tightly start damage parts . you need give it cleaning each day . not thorough , hefty cleaning , but shake dust bin quick glance brushes . if it becomes normal natural part your schedule , it really no big deal all . i definitely think you should not dust bin light - most definitely not use it know when clean your roomba . this would really lead more roomba issues ... which isn't good owners nor good irobot ! roombas run wonderfully when they're kept clean - they break down quickly if allowed fill crud . you might expect any appliance . so letting roombas fill up more crud than they should , irobot going get bad reputation . which shame . we end up getting intellibin when we issues one our regular roombas send it repairs . because roomba such hot item right now , our failure right before 2006 holiday season , it over 2 months we still hadn't gotten replacement roomba back . we called complained , they sent us off intellibin version free upgrade . it works exactly same scheduler , i kept waiting bin full light light up . bin * stuffed * full junk it kept going . eventually after few runs it light up , but i really question how well suction could working then . i really would much rather just empty it after each run - it 20 second job - vs waiting light light up roomba performance suffer result . my verdict - get regular scheduler which * awesome * keeps our home incredibly clean . ignore this improvement . it not worth $20 relying it could actually cause you more trouble . quick comment cost - people easily pay $500-$700 dishwasher , think it essential part life . i certainly know i love my dishwasher . dishwasher , you still certain things hand - fine crystal stemware , large pots . even so , dishwasher makes your daily life easier . i consider roomba far better than dishwasher , especially if you pets . every morning , all pet hair dander just gone . it makes my daily life - since i work home am breathing air every second day - infinitely better healthier . roombas cheaper , too	1

my fiance bought this coffee maker wal-mart sale . it worked flawlessly week or two . then i thought it would good idea put tea bag compartment where coffee goes . my fiance told me later instructions advised against it might damage unit . next day or two unit malfunctioned - it would buzz then two blue lights would blink . sometimes we could unplug it start over it would work but problem seemed become more frequent ( frustrating ) . i noticed lid locks place while unit brewing , so round top part inside apparently rotates locks into bottom part ( where pods go ) . it occurred me buzzing sound sound locking mechanism rotating into place that when problem occurs ( intermittently ) . so we started pressing down lid before clicking brew button it always works fine when we . ( apparently if lid doesn't close snuggly then locking mechanism jams you get blinking lights must then reset it unplugging it . ) i hope this review helps anyone else this problem . i've seen several comments others same issue . other than this one issue which turns out minor if you know workaround , we love this coffee maker ! we also use it just make quick hot water ramen noodles or tea ( but i don't put tea bags machine any more , just cup ! ) . we've it couple months now use it least once day , usually more	1

very practical inexpensive way carry your knives if you're " cook go . " 7 slots should more than enough carry your essential knives , sharpening steel maybe tongs , peeler and/or zester - it also slot accomodate cleaver . henckels roll generous 19 inches long , which could , conceivably , allow you carry even your woodman pal . remember , you'll still need keep your knives protected blade guards , otherwise you'll cut into roll - extra expense which you need take into account . finally , i feel , they included handle , it would made superior product .	1

it seems i've spent years trying find " perfect " teakettle . something would give good honest , audible whistle when boiling , then allow one pour steaming hot water without put hand anywhere near spou t.t hat didn't seem like much ask , but we heck time finding such thing . we found some close , but which you fill only through spout . it seems me one should lid pot like this , able get inside clean it , inspect damage or wear , or whatever . suddenly , we came across this one . amazon there 4-cup version , two 8-cup versions . there one copper bottom resemble traditional revereware look , but after looking pictures , we bought one pure stainless steel top bottom . entire top pot non-shiny plastic some kind -- one those new space-age materials not get hot metal or some other materials . designers revere should commended making total break tradition so they could create pot so practical . lid top not centered beneath handle , which means you reach inside , or fill it , more easily than typical pot where handle gets way . handle very well balanced " trigger " open spout well-positioned . you hold spout partly open , or pull it completely open , which point trigger " locks " it open position . this saves lot finger fatigue when pouring multiple cups tea , or whatever . close it , one simply pushes forward back trigger . you don't need instructions , although they included . when you pick this thing up pour it , it feels totally natural your hand , you figure it out instinctively . it grea t.t he spout slight diagonal " crease " its tip drip-free pouring , which just thoughtful feature overall thoughtful original design . we chose larger size mostly able serve more than couple people time if we should company . we're glad we made choice , because honestly 8-cup version looks small compared our old kettle . other one more rounded perhaps larger capacity . i haven't measured capacity revere model , i'm not obsessed it , i'm sure it suit our needs . i suspect compact appearance most likely function efficient design . this one those purchases , its own small way , makes every day better improving small task one frequently . course it far too early tell how it stand up long use , but we're quite satisfied ours expect it pleasure long time	1

i purchased this gift my son who loves anything dipped chocolate . he his eye much larger fountains . i wanted something smaller he could use without making big mess . i also not want 3 pounds chocolate melted once . this little pot perfect reason . you melt 1 1/2 cups chips or whatever type chocolate you want . this allow you dip over 2 pounds strawberries numerous pretzels one batch . because it size ease use it pulled out several times already . i highly reccomend this anyone who looking smaller chocolate fondue pot . think it mini crock pot that what it reminds me most .	1
i love this pan ! it perfect so many things , especially pan meals ! only problem , my opinion , black coating . i know they use this coating frying pans so you fry higher temp , but inside never looks nice . it not non-stick , but i definitely prefer light gray interior . overall , though , this one keeper	1
it soft medium-sized . didn't pay too much them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over ask if they could take one . now i don't any left , but they're interseting little soft " stuffed animal " kind thing . no real practical purpose probably - i heard it horror if it ever opens/spills its contents . it kind funny - thing itself soft - but it comes huge box tons air pillows ( when you order it amazon least ) . so if you're moving need packing material , then here 2-for-1 special .	1
best deal money . folds up easy . we use it kitchen reach high places , it folds up slides easily next refrigerator . stool sturdy , not slip floor when opened up . great product	1

this steamer powerful enough clean entire tiles kichen area , floors , stoves so . it very worth buying this . price very reasnable , but it works perfectly . i recommen this item !	1
i got more than i expected . which good , because it seemed over priced when i bought it . but it only one i could find truly variable temp control . now , i think price fair . pro's- variable temprature : this why i picked this product . i wanted full control temp water . - filtered spout : i don't use it . could useful keeping tea or any other particles pot while pouring . - dock station : pot easily removed doc , so there no cord way when pouring . - hidden cord : cord winds up inside dock . makes it easy hide extra cord , if you luxury . see cons :( . - insulated : keeps water hot long time . - auto off : turns when it gets temperature . cons- 4ft cord : i could use 1 more foot :( . wish list : - stay option : keeping water temperature would nice option . rather than letting it slowly cool down . - thermometer : doesn't tell you actual temperature water . not even estimate temperature knob .	1
we use this our baby room it worked fine through two winters so far . water filter great plus make sure we getting clean mist . we never any " puddle " problems others written . i would recommend this item . only down side me it goes through water tank pretty quickly . update : 1 year later , it quit working . i would no longer suggest you purchased this unit . i wish i could reduce this 1 star	1

when i got my fagor pressure cooker i thought it going long relationship . but i learned over past few months it much more trouble than it worth . it may cut cooking time half , but it certainly doubles clean-up time . it hard regulate cooking food that locked inside cooker . regular cooking pot i look inside see how things going , add things right time , make any adjustments i need . i like ease just bringing regular pot boil , reducing simmer , coming back when timer goes off . i hate trying get pressure right , worrying it too much pressure , then waiting it depressurize or depressurizing it manually speed things up . food textures often all wrong . when it ? you can't just open it up , look inside say " ten more minutes " . same price you get some very nice copper-bottom pans last your whole lifetime no gaskets or valves need replacing	1

i actually preferred pfaltzgraff mystic pattern but my oldest dd her husband gave me set cappucino christmas . service 4 not enough which why i purchased set through amazon . price right - even shipping - this set cheaper than local department stores . first , i'd like say my order arrived quickly however 2 plates broken . rather than just send replacement plates , amazon sent entire set - which also came broken plate so i sent back set 3 broken plates . what they these ? why not keep unbroken items replacements ? it would definitely cheaper shipping out individual items than entire sets ! dishes - i haven't seen any signs discolorings reported other reviewers . i like set sturdy but after using corelle many years it taken some time get adjusted it . i love size shapes plates , mugs bowls . bowls deep - perfect ice cream or cereal so deep it eliminates spills . mugs easy handle even hottest beverages inside . course , all pieces easy clean . color neutral - goes perfect my kitchen . can't wait add other pieces it	1

i ton research air filters before i purchased this one . this product not reviewed anywhere but here - which strange . said , only review positive one , which other machines reviewed air raid sirens or too expensive keep stocked filters . so , i figured , how bad could this one ? i've it 2 days , so i cant really give long-term review . however , i am pleased already . whether its actually working , or i believe its working so therefore its working , i am already sleeping better . i suffering terrible hay fever waking up stuffy noses , headaches , nose dryness , etc . past two nights , i've slept lot better . noise : low setting sounds like white-noise machine you might put baby room . its low hum , no clicking , constant low noise . it doesnt bother me . higher speeds definitely loud - but not like siren , or anything obtrusive . highest speed sounds like loud air conditioner doesnt shut off --- you turn up your tv slightly . said , i dont find it soo loud i am annoyed . smell : i've read these machines bad rubbery smell . first , this one slight rubber scent . it went away after one day running it one low . i dont smell anything now . cost : pre-filter $7 amazon i've read you dont replace it lot . i not bought hepa replacement , so i wont comment . size : instructions say you need 3 feet around it , so you cant really put it under table . its width nightstand , so i think its perfect corner room , but you it away wall . honestly , i'm so desperate breath , i don't really care it sticks out like sore thumb . if you really into things tucked away , you might want look into " tower " air filter . this one sits corner my bedroom , slightly away wall	1

i several rooms including my kitchen white shiny ceramic tile floors white grout . no matter what i used clean floor i dry it i cleaned most often within day or two it looked hazy or smeary . since using this steam vac i go well over week cleanings floor never looked better . steamer removes surface dirt grout , so if you're buying it primarily clean grout expect still use elbow grease or chemicals . it too messy practical cleaning windows it didn't very well cleaning soap film off shower door . it , however , very well mold . i also love it cleaning my jewelry silk plants my freshwater aquarium ! no more brown spots silk plants . best part all things i've mentioned -- no chemicals inhale or contaminate environment . unit sturdy , heats up quickly includes lot handy attachments .	1

i've used this washer 50 loads since buying jr early october , 2006 . i live studio new york bought this one because ( 1 ) it sink adapter , which front-loading 14.3 -lb model didn't seem include ( 2 ) 17.5 inches wide/deep , it fit through my bathroom door , which front-loading 14.3 -lb model ( 20.5 inches wide ) wouldn't . out box , you install included metal pan bottom . install it so it convex : there reason legs so high . one problems i during installation one screws holding this metal pan body comes very close clamp holding gooseneck drain tube it exits body . clamp fallen out position , end screw close where clamp goes . i don't think i ever danger puncturing drainage tube , but it something watch out . you need place hang drainage tube , 31.5 40 inches high . machine cannot fill tub water height above maximum height drainage path . my first two loads , i made puddle water ground . there two reasons this : first time , water supply hose not tightened sufficiently machine end , water dribbled out behind machine until i figured out what going . tightened ( i used wrench ) , there no leak . my second load , i put too many clothes ( more later ) there water-resistant nylon jacket top . just before very first spin cycle , some water cupped jacket not drain out wash water . when tub started spin , water came out . i never loaded many clothes into washer again , haven't any spills since . during normal wash cycle , machine following steps three times : fill , agitate , agitate , drain , spin , drain , spin , drain , spin . second third iterations called " rinse " cycle . often , water out drain still bubbly after second spin , i suspect i'm using too much detergent . ( i'm using quarter capful or less all no-fragrance 3x liquid concentrate . ) so , i run rinse cycle . if machine detects unbalance condition during spin , it stop , fill tub water , agitate attempt redistribute clothes before draining spinning again . i think machine this two or three times before giving up beeping ten times alert user unbalance condition . during agitation process , this machine tends intertwine long or extended parts clothing into braid-like knots . this includes shirt sleeves socks . example , when i wash four or five long-sleeved shirts together , i always untie separate two or three shirts where sleeves twisted together . i think good washing where wash water touch every surface clothes , tied together prevents this . these problems probably would not happen front-loading washing machine . what capacity this washer ? well , i would say : 2 bath towels ; or2 pairs jeans or pants ; or2 sweatshirts 1 pair sweat pants ; or4-5 long-sleeved oxford shirts ; or6 small-size undershirts ; or8-12 medium-size boxer underwear . that " high " water level . you may able load more than , but i think clothes won't get clean . i once tried wash terrycloth robe . robe fit tub , but machine always got unbalance condition when it tried spin . i think it sort like trying run centrifuge only one tube . sometimes after spin cycle i find sock or shirt stretched across middle tub , instead thrown centrifugally against tub walls . using my dsc-p71 digital camera multi-burst 30 frames-per-second mode light dark shirt washer , i estimate initial spin 450 rpm ( light shirt passed once every 4 frames ) final spin 780 rpm ( light shirt passed 6.5 times 0.5 seconds - once every other frame ) . if i hang clothes my studio ( not bathroom ) , then they dry one day or less , depending humidity . it takes much longer if i hang them bathroom	1

i not good pillow long time . i wouldn't pay upwards fifty dollars pillow . but i gave after reading reviews got this one . it way overpriced my opinion but they onto very good idea . first , i it couple weeks it pretty flat now . coils only very center pillow , times you notice them there , but not bad way , just noticable . problem fluff they add pillow must cheapest possible nothing . i imagine i really strange looking square blob surrounded moat flat fabric pretty soon . first , it really comfy . i think if they either put high quality fluff around it , or better yet put coils through entire thing , higher ones center , this would outstanding , beyond all other pillows ! but it , it not worth price yet . if you tons money burn , go ahead try it . i wouldn't recommend anyone get two sleep once , they would awkward they would falling off sides eachother . you could use regular pillow below this one , but then you back into same pillow finding - switching game we all want avoid . i would given three stars if it lot cheaper , but after going flat after only few weeks , price , i give it two	1

i just replaced my gaggia titanium which after 3 months decided break down . i decided rather than replace same machine go much-praised jura machines . z5 particularly appealed it unique one-touch cappucino function , which avoids clumsy looking " automatic frothing attachments " found so many machines . machine easy set up , almost same footprint titanium , so doesn't take up too much space . it comes classy looking thermal milk container ( 1 litre ) which keeps milk ready chilled up 8 hours . front machine brushed aluminium ( not plastic many jura machines ) which far easier keep clean than titanium brushed stainless steel ( fingerprints ! ) . display prompts clear ( product names such " 1 espresso " changed should you so desire - i personally can't see point this , since name isn't displayed until you press key dispense drink . temperature ( also adjustable ) coffee , hot water also milk fantastic - i mine set " normal " setting it very hot - much more so than titanium many other machines which even set " highest " still could hotter . crema good , taste great . brew group non-removable self-cleaning ( you prompted when run rinse cycle or pop cleaning tablet ) . you program quantity , temperature strength all drinks , choose override these on-the-fly should you wish , which very handy . water container larger than titanium most other domestic machines you use claris water filter cartridges , or alternatively opt use descaling tablets every so often ( again , you prompted when this ) . dump box , drip tray suitably large so not emptied too frequently ( every 20 cups ) . i only 2 grumbles this machine . one central coffee spout ( which illuminates cups during dispensing coffee ) not adjust high enough large mugs . silly thing you also dispense coffee cappuccino spout which offers 2 interchangeable spouts - one small cups one tall mugs . why they couldn't make central coffee spout raise same height shame , but not end world . my second gripe consumables - ie . filters / descaling tablets / cappuccino cleaner / machine cleaning tablets way over-priced . since you use jura-brand ones keep within warranty conditions , you don't much option but pay these high prices . overall though , if you money , then go it - this machine fantastic , looks great , quietest fully automatic far - this doesn't wake up whole house when you make coffee	1
we apricot tree my parents ' house my dad used love make frozen apricots . problem drying them however , they stick dehydrator sugars concentrate fruit . if you dried fruits ( we apples , pears peaches ) you know they stick normal trays . berries fall through . if you into dehydrating your produce , these tray inserts come out so you scrape off dried product wash them easily . i wish these jerky-fruit-leather sheets came dehydrator but they don't . if you grow vegetables fruits , this very useful processing your crop .	1

save yourself lot trouble don't buy this one ! first time i bought it , it worked 2 weeks , then decreased output due black paint flaking off nebulizer ( part makes mist ) . so i returned it bought one ... this one worked off week then never worked right after , despite my careful cleaning disinfecting , just like owners manual instructs . i use it my baby room ( very small room ) , after first week , couldn't get humidity above 20% . it just not dependable , which pain when she wakes up constantly throughout night sniffing fussing due dry air ! i just ordered vornado 2.8 gal cool mist humidifier ... hopefully work much better !	-1

great idea , just what i looking -- salt shaker lets you choose whether it fine shake , big shake , pouring ( recipes ) , or closed ( humid environments ) . great product	1
overall i dont any major complaints - seems great unit what i want it - humidify my house . i plan running it 24/7 during winter addition my furnace humidifier which isnt quite cutting it . this should help reduce filter problems since i wont standing water unit . assembled quickly - wheels not just gravity based like one review - they little rims make them stay bottom . i wouldn't recommend rolling it around like roller coaster but it gets job . based upon everything i read humidifiers some cleaning etc comes territory which i handle no problem . very simple filling water containers - you need deeper sink or tub fill them . i like fact it two so i run it low fan just fill one they easier(lighter ) carry . top removes easily replacement filters/cleaning unit which one nice selling points me(cheaper filters)i consider it run pretty quiet low medium fan settings - high noticable but if you want pump moisture into air over large area .. you it somehow . it blow cool air so keep mind . digital reading/setting humidity nice seems accurate long you dont crowd humidifier . not sure what i think ionizer feature - not like i measure air content see if it works but i it anyway . it make semi frequent gurgling noise it dispenses water into base it runs which one minor complaint it seems like unit could more " snug " when you put tanks but these very minor observations . i'm happy now - good luck	1

i love my dualit ! our old toaster died one sunday morning so monday i started searching new one . we cuisanart - i planned buying same brand toaster maybe just 4 slot version until i read reviews . one sale local department store ( $100)got miserable reviews amazon , so i searched searched searched only toaster got consistantly good reviews dualit . i ended up purchasing refurbished dualit website half price . i'm not one skimp kitchen appliances or gadgets , but spending over $200 toaster seemed bit extreme . now i've received it i've decided it worth every penny . if it breaks tomorrow , i'd definitely run right out spend pay full price replace it . i love fact operates completely different than any other toaster out there . it best preheat it - but once you you put pieces bread one right after consistant results . none problems you w/american toasters when they get heated where first piece perfect , next too light , next comes out more like piece bread so . other thing i love fact you raise lower bread when timer goes off , versus american toasters where you push toast down activate toaster . stupid push button/latch mechanism death every toaster i've ever owned . i playing couple cuisanarts department store both units it broken - just store use , let alone actual use ! now back price again . my sister who doesn't appreciate good kitchenware swears cheap toasters because she " replace them every couple years when something breaks " . i started think back my old cuisanart i loved . i received it shower gift when we married 8 years ago time it $60 . it great toaster if you averaged it out it cost $8 year own . so - given , if i replaced cheap toaster every other year , i doubt i could find $16 toaster even discount store would last more than year . hopefully i haven't cursed my dualit but if so , like i said earlier , i'd replace it full priced non-refurbished any day . buy one , you'll happy you .	1
when these mugs arrived , i surprised see how gorgeous they . color ( cobalt ) , glaze , shape , weight , generous handle - all perfect ! they even fit under spout my senseo coffeemaker . great mugs , i love them !	1
i surprised what poor reviews most crock pots received amazon.com, but i decided buy this little one when i saw it target $9.99 . figured even if it didn't work well , that not much money lose ! well , this my first crock pot i love it . i'm glad there one this small . i usually fill it only half way then leftovers , but it could probably feed family four without leftovers . lot reviews other crock pots said lids often fit poorly , but lid mine perfect . i've used it seven times so far everything wonderful ! i particularly like applesauce recipe comes crock pot , it makes best applesauce ever it nice just peel them night before wake up hot applesauce ( also good over ice cream ) . keep mind crock pot only low heat setting , but i haven't any trouble cooking recipes call high setting here . just takes bit longer . also , it not tough all convert recipes larger crocks fit this one . mine doesn't any problem cooking hot , maybe it just other reviewer crock pot . i would recommend this anyone , it well worth money	1

i find it more than bit ridiculous pur charges 40 dollars their product 20 - 25 dollars their replacement filters . i owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters every one them ended up garbage within first year use . why ? because they begin leak faucet connection this leak grows progressively worse over time . tightening unit not help fact may make leak worse . removing reinstalling unit not help . i become so frustrated pur water products i never again purchase anything made them . i just installed brita filter my sink couple days ago no problems yet even if any occur brita more reasonably priced up 15 dollars cheaper sink mounted unit . yourself favor avoid this over-priced piece junk all costs	-1

there lot theoretically good ideas fail when executed . this one them . 1/quality:it made cheaply , even before it breaks , it flimsiness not inspire confidence . 2/resistance : levels resistance nothing real progression , anyone who ' seriously ' uses this too strong machine few weeks , ( many unchallenged right beginning ) . standard : if set longer than minute you still strength continue , you need more resistance . 3/compared crunches : there reason why crunches lying down : weight torso supplies fairly heavy resistance , whereas when you crunch uptight position weight torso actually helps effort , you dropping your weight down instead lifting it up . much what makes ab crunch machine ' work ' your weight dropping it , not your muscles working . this little piece plastic doesn't springs strong enough resist your bodyweight strengthen your muscles besides . ( you may achieve isometric contraction some effect , but you get -exactly- this effect , or -better- , without any equipment all ! just tense up seated crunch position minute or so . ) ... course , time product appealing public claiming how supposedly -huge- hassle lying down (??) crunches , we've reached real problem : this thing designed avoid effort . it seems though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort . unfortunately , exercise effort , more you avoid effort , less exercise you get	-1

worn out capresso machine after daily brewing 4-6 shots espresso making lattes/cappuccinos , etc . i went looking more durable machine . i bought x1 2001/2 when it brand new model ( stainless ) it great : 1 . it heats up quickly . 2 . it brews very consistently . 3 . ese thing best mess-preventer ever . 4 . separate steam-temperature setting great . heats milk much faster than other , cheaper consumer models . 5 . machine capacity steam enough milk least 3 tall lattes before needing quick " refill " water pump switch . 6 . i like simplicity total manual operation . switches aren't labeled , but there only 3 . kind morning meditation me . most important , non-obvious things : 1 . don't leave pod holder move temperature steam setting . when you unhook pod holder , steam instantly blow apart ese pod , which , given it more than boiling hot , hurt , plus dry instantly wall . 2 . use individually wrapped ese pods , unless you use them all within 2-3 hours opening tin . they sour very quickly , even freezer . i am partial starbucks pods , given my household addiction brand , but i think more preference than quality issue . illy tastes fine , but you use them all quickly . 3 . if you serve lot guests , double unit ( x3 ? ) might better . dual-temperature settings , you'll spend lot time running water through unit cool steam setting back down brew next batch espresso . lots refills water container , which bit pain remove back machine . overall , great performer after 4 years daily , multiple use . this thing great machine	1
chrome look this unit quite nice really look like chrome ( doesn't look cheap like some other metallic plastics ) , matching chrome fixtures nicely . but important part this filter really its job . you'll find pur website pur ulitmate nsf certified effectively filter 28 contaminants listed nsf standard 53 , whereas some competing products , including popular disposable model doesn't use cartridges , claim certification less than third those . i'm sure there truly comparable filters out there , but check specs before you buy . flow rate seems reasonable me . i fill up my 12-cup coffee carafe under minute , i don't mind taking couple extra seconds peace mind i'm drinking cleaner , safer water . after all , i won't needing it washing dishes or taking shower . it very easy install , it seems more durable than older generation pur faucet-mount filter i developed leaks after while . this one working almost year no leakage all	1

i bought this my wife who drinks six cups every morning ( finally got her switch mostly decaf ) . i first bought less expensive ( still @$400 ) machine which not automated . took it back when i realized it probably share space counter our current coffee maker using it involved additional tasks three kids we already enough tasks . jura-capresso works great - easy use , easy clean ( really only steam wand simple clean espresso or coffee fills cup ) no extra work . it tells you when empty grounds ( every 10 cups ) , fill water beans . it rinses nozzle automatically when it shuts down ( two hour auto shut down ) tells you rinse it ( pushing button ) when you power it up . i cannot think easier way coffee , espresso , cappuccino or cafe au lait anytime we feel like it . i especially like fact we not tied into using company pods ( paying premium wasting lot paper ) load any bean we desire or use bypass use ground coffee . two wishes - larger water tank ( or ability hook up water supply ) allowing angle steam wand move higher it pain put wand into larger mugs . but those just wishes - not gripes . two months no problems - just got steamer container came free but haven't tried it yet . great buy !!!	1
i keep this unit running throughout day my bedroom shut it off bedtime . ( too noisy me ) . i'm actually sleeping better/less stuffy . i recommend this filter anyone who some difficulty breathing easy night	1
this blender simply just powerful good looking blender so simple i bet even george . bush use it ( no offense republicans , i am one you anyway ) . this thing blend or crush or chop , or anything ( depending settings ) your frozen cranberries sticky gummy bears ( don't ask ) . no matter how many foodstuffs you mix different types or different stages matter it throughly blend them make smooth combo drinks or throughly spread flavored salsa or just knock out lumps pudding or gravy point it would cause french chief weep jealousy . i'm person who hates cleaning honest but simply this blender just easy clean despite what type mess i make blending jar or button counter sticky milkshake greasy gravy . i'm person who when i buy something i don't read instructions , i just try get feel how use it simply all this blender vast settings self-explanatory no instructions needed , so i got feel it no-time	1
i'm sure there cutlery snobs out there who would turn up their nose anything you find local " bedding bathing further " type store ... but this thing wicked . it huge , huge step up generic chefmate set i got while back . i cut tomato half quite literally accident , while old knife would take enough pressure deform poor little fruit or some sort sawing . think this introduction proper knives if you must , but i can't see reason get anything else ... unless it 10 " version ! incidentally , i chose this over wusthof , henkel , etc because handle fit my hand best i like " japanese style " blade no bolster . i'd recommend going brickmortar get feel options before buying	1

when i got my gaggia more than several decades ago , it not yet called classic . it called coffee gaggia . 20 years ago , some minor changes made , unit renamed classic . new " coffee gaggia " not same this machine . this machine robust build , high quality parts . its tank heats water quickly , proper temperature , pump powerful enough job properly . i would strongly recommend using filtered water , especially low mineral content , so deposits not build up tank . my version all metal frothing wand , which good job skills operator allow . newer versions " turbo frother , " optional milk frother take guess work out frothing place foamed milk directly into cup . i can't comment these newer features , but perhaps they allow better job those less experience . newer models brushed stainless , while original models appliance enamel finish . since old finish allowed water penetrate under any scratches or imperfections finish , this particular problem near portafilter holder underneath drip tray . new version should retain its finish far longer , although old one still not show any wear places visible machine assembled . minor differences new machine more robust looking steam knob moved side , thermostat light , which indicated unit heating , replaced " ready " light integrated into coffee switch signals opposite . time i've my machine , i've only minor problems it . my steam thermostat needed replaced once , light my power switch stopped working . these larger issues before internet made it easy find parts , these items hard find locally . other problem if unit not used extended periods , tank allowed dry out completely , water used hard , then some parts subject clogging . troubleshooting steps manual not helpful these sorts problems . machine disassembled cleaning somebody who mechanically inclined , but unless you feel comfortable appliance repair , you better off avoiding situation using filtered water , and/or descaling regularly , especially before any long term storage . other " parts " issue gasket filter basket should considered consumable part , should sold every dealer accessory , rather than just repair facilities . machine really should included extra one since this only part definitely wear out regular use . it might take few years or longer , easy replace , but it wear out . overall , this well built machine should last you many decades . although it seemed expensive when i bought it , it averaged out 6 cents day own it , which well worth price , i'll probably get few decades out it . if you used cheaper espresso makers , you appreciate robustness quality this unit . features such three way solenoid controlled valve might transparent user , but lack them become clear when you use cheaper machine . this one just keeps going going .	1

after burning through several " cheap " vacuums , i bought this product confidence after my trepidation eased great reviews . i bought this 10 months ago now it dead . i live house wood floors only used this clean 4 rooms rugs . suction initially great first use i thought it broken until i discovered trap full ( duh ) . me sold but after last time i cleaned it out , it just died . i'm no dummy fixing things but why i bought " good " vacuum . well , $200 trash	1
these really beautiful glasses , incredibly light . we no dishwashwer , though , i broke one first time i washed it ( putting dishsponge down inside ) - i careful . these really , really delicate . my husband broke one next day . we also got white wine version these glasses , one broken upon arrival - still wrapped its bubble wrap . i no idea why bodum decided make these such incredibly thin glass . they're really beautiful , we love using them , but it ridiculous this careful them - i mean , we other wine glasses i used think delicate , but these bodum ones take cake . we also bought double-walled bodum glasses , those beautiful much sturdier ( although they're not wine ..... )	1
if your knives dull , chances you need sharpen them before you need hone them . get diamond-impregnated steel such this one . this steel quickly sharpen your knives . don't try sharpen your knives honing steels come most knive sets or popularly available or you'll wreck honing steel well waste lot elbow grease . they say use steel least long your knife . i don't any 12quot ; knives , but i like little extra room error ..	1

i adore this coffee maker ! i've read reviews , i've used one ( not mine ) seven months daily ... all no problems . owner machine i am using warned me make sure push filter door until it clicks firmly before assuming it ready brew . she stated she problem filter only once , she smart enough figure it out never problem . if i any complaint this system all it would when it begins cycle 4:30 a.m. , grinder wakes up everyone house . when i know i get up early , i just grind beans myself night before . no big deal . i love this item am here purchase one myself ... i'm buying reconditioned one , because , somebody else couldn't figure it out , sent it back i'm only going pay half price because i'm smart enough know how close filter door ! funny how it manufacturer problem every time consumer too limp read directions . here your sign	1
i bought this after i read it recommended author " cat vs . cat " . i 3 cats - stuck-up prissy female , obese lazy female , psychotic energetic male . i love this thing ! i am so amazed very happy all 3 them love this toy ! my stuck-up cat usually never plays cat toys , only strings , pens , straws . my fat cat just never plays , but obsessed watching out window talking birds . male , however , born feral cat colony , but bottle fed my step-sister . he endless energy . before i even got da bird out its package he excited ( other two sleeping ) . we started playing , soon fat one came downstairs see what going . before long , i my two females playing it , put male room . only thing you might want consider if you cat who over possessive or wild , he/she may destroy feathers before normal cat would . my male cat so nuts over this , he actually tiring himself out point panting . problem when he would actually catch da bird , he not let go growls , so other cats don't want play . really , if you think it , wild cats ( some domestic ) catch birds then take them off eat , but long you don't allow them get aggressive it , you should fine . i definitely recommend this toy . sure you keep this somewhere your cats can't find it when you aren't playing them .	1

i've this grinder over two decades it performed well . when i first got my machine , i wondered which setting number would good cappuccino , or any particular grind . manual said since coffee vary variety variety , or even one roast , it matter adjusting each batch beans . perhaps 34 settings , people found helpful , but i found my beans consistent enough adjustments necessary type coffee , but left alone particular type coffee particular variety beans source . time i got machine , i got my beans peet back when they five stores no other distribution channels . although they larger chain now , they still small enough roasting well controlled , they still buy beans single source variety meet needs chain . beans other sources , where roasting variety locations , or beans differing sources , you might need pay more attention adjustments . much bigger issue affects strength everything else dosing . reading other reviews , it not seem changed since i got my unit . top unit filled beans , part over dispensing area fill up remarkably consistent grind . round area divided into six sections , like wheel spokes . five sections get filled grounds . one section empty , above dispenser . each time lever pulled , wheel rotates one position clockwise , one section gets dispensed through empty section . theory , if unit full , amount coffee each section would consistent . chances real life , you would not want fill unit up home use , since grounds would not fresh time you use them . if you grind just enough few cups , then coffee not end up compartments evenly , dosing counting pulls not work . if you lift lower lid , you see where coffee , you likely see small mound back partly filled areas toward front if you grind smaller amounts . you could redistribute things brush , but even way , some areas would end up more compacted than others . or you could merely gain experience know how much dispensed compared how much you need , pull handle accordingly . option gring lower lid off . you watch grinds fall into compartment , you rotate each compartment gets filled , dispensing you go . then you become consistent once you develop good eye it . whether you want consider dispenser poorly designed matter perspective . if you believe this unit designed grind beans two cups coffee , then it would fair conclusion . if you believe this unit designed people who prepare 6-12 cups hour , you might think it just fine . if you believe it designed higher level fairly constant use , you would probably not disappointed . but since this unit most likely home users , it hard claim dispenser ideally suited task . experience let you know how high grounds supposed when you put them filter basket , it not going take you long learn . while this unit not fool proof , chances you not fool , so things work out . me , bottom line once you know correct grind setting your beans , unit more " set it forget it " than what instructions said , least consistent beans , but dispenser lot less " set it forget it " than what literature implies . personally , i prefer unit takes guess work out getting grinds right consistency , since it easy get amount dispensed right eyeballing it . this unit very well respect . i use this conjunction gaggia coffee ( now known gaggia classic ; new gaggia coffee different machine ) two make good pair . learning how much coffee dispense minor part , compared learning how long hold switch espresso machine , or how froth milk perfectly , but ultimately , it boils down knowing how make proper espresso . if you tell when stop water based color coffee coming out , then bit more or less grinder affect how full cup gets rather than taste your brew . you can't automate perfect espresso , but you use correct tools allow you make one experience	1

this pot rack easy assemble included dozen hooks . no need order expensive extra hooks ! rack sturdy functional . despite its compact size , it held 6 pots 5 frying pans ( some which very heavy ) , wire strainer basket , without looking over-crowded . bulk weight held single center screw top . i believe this screw must hit stud , due tremendous weight it bears , so plan center rack stud . i'm not sure anchor through drywall would adequate , unless you plan hang only few pans . two other screws sides hold rack swaying . wire grid makes cute shelf plant . all all , this quick , easy , attractive solution overcrowded kitchen . great value price	1
it beautiful mold , i excited make cake shape sunflower . i am pretty experienced baker , my success rate , even tricky procedures , very high . five attempts use this cake pan , each ime increasing how slavishly i greased floured alleged " non stick " surface , careful remove it per instructions - after cooling 10-15 minutes rack after removing oven , i never got it out one piece . mold detailed corners too sharp cleanly release cake . i even tried letting it fully cool hopes some shrinkage would help get cake out . i own other nordic ware pans better luck them , but this particular mold loser , which very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially if it worked . if you want use it jello , i'm sure it fine , but cakes , it waste time money .	-1

rival� slicer ( model 1060c ) generally well designed unit . i say generally because there appears , my unqualified opinion , one major design and/or manufacturing flaw associated product . first unit i received broken speed control knob prevented any speed adjustment . this unit exchanged ( thank you amazon making process painlessly easy ) . this second unit also broken speed control knob , failure point identical first . stem speed control knob either woefully under designed or it forced into wrong position ( it detent ) during assembly . this really too bad since unit looks like it would job which it intended quite well . what good this product : - heavy-duty construction ( parts i expected plastic made cast aluminum)- heavy-duty , thick stainless steel blade - removable cleaning- angled slicing surface- tray catch slices what ever- cuts up 5/8 " slices- integrated cutting boardwhat not so good this product : - there rubber suction cups four bottom corners protect surface unit sitting hold it place while it used . this would great feature except suction cups stick surface pull out unit when it lifted up . - speed control knob stated above ( sole reason number 1 rating )	-1

this really cool concept , poorly executed . clear sleeve slides up down aluminum cylinder . top cylinder rubber gasket seals sleeve , thus preventing leakage sleeve cylinder . all works fine . problem bottom aluminum cylinder plastic ring larger diameter than cylinder . this ring stops sleeve sliding below top cylinder , also acts foot so you stand measuring cup . unfortunately , ring made fairly hard plastic , which become brittle crack . but it doesn't break away cleanly - so you're left measuring cup won't stand up straight . might fine if you're measuring things dumping them straight into bowl , but if you sit thing down while it full , forget it	1
litter locker great , i keep it next my omega paw litter box which i also highly recommend . i got mine online large chain pet store ... its basically spool inside , each turn wheel wraps bag into this spool . think garden hose ... most folks complain refills not last . hopefully they not tossing them when they empty device . biggest problem " spool " litter become too big spin inside locker , most people may think they empty it totally replace refill . you actually just empty spool once week or every 2 weeks , just not replace bag refill until it actually empties ! simply cut bag toss litter , tie it off then use same refill again until it runs out . i expect get around 6 weeks out each refill this method 1 cat , maybe longer	1
this measuring cup very difficult slide clean . it much easier spray regular measuring cup non-stick cooking spray help release sticky things such peanut butter or honey . spend your money good set traditional measuring cups	1

mentioned reviewer , this item critical flaw : it just too short . it can't used bowls over few inches tall , small plates small pile food , cover touching food . this especially troublesome when cover used prevent splatters ... dried splattered food inside cover happily mingling food your plate . other than , it its job well prevents splatters . but i simply don't enough instances where i use it . ideally , more versatile , cover should least twice it current height , which why i'm continuing my search	-1

ice cubes come out intact - not chipped or cracked . get them out , push each cube bottom your finger . fastest easiest results , wait 5 minutes after taking tray out freezer . this way , ice cubes pop right out . if you don't wait , your fingertip freezing while trying push them out	1
i agree previous reviews this dispensses honey way too slowly . additionally , it much too difficult fill without making mess , since you cannot top open without bottom open well . this dispenser just not worth trouble mess , no matter how great idea	-1

positive : great ! great ! great ! i spent weeks going over reviews comments electric food slicers preparation replacing one i using 25 years . it heavy , clunky would slide around counter when used . i only took it out use when nothing else would work . but it slice . after reading all i could reviews , i decided model 632 seemed best fit my use . cooking hobby not profession so i needed nothing more than good quality , home slicer . i decided keep new slicer counter while so i could try it out . i think it found permanent home . i find i am using it almost every day bread , meat , cheese vegetables . operation smooth caliper dial , very repeatable . it stable not " walk " counter when slicing . it appears well manufactured durable . several reviewers pointed on/off lock switches locations problem . i find just opposite true . their location both logical easy use . though i don't use it often , i found little extra i paid tilt table worth cost . overall , it met and/or exceeded every expectation i prior purchase . negative : if there downside , it would component parts not dishwasher safe . this nothing more very minor annoyance , since unit comes apart very easily requires little or no effort clean . ( just use caution when cleaning blade . ) overall : i may find problems future , but present it gets 5 stars plus . my opinion , good buy	1

people who addicted zojirushi may change their mind when they discover how great sanyo ecj models !! i ecj-f50s , pretty much same d55s but thicker titanium coating -- 3.5 mm !! 5.5 cup only 2.5 mm thick titanium coating . it super durable cooks rice perfectly ! we using rice cooker our whole life this best we used so far ! if size doesn't really matter , go 5 cup f50s model , one much better !	1
i've owned several cheaper toaster ovens , they always fizzled out , only good making toast , not baking . i decided buy something high end , i am glad i . i wanted something smaller than my oven bake , this job well , i made pie turned out perfectly baked ( 9 " pie pan fitted perfectly ) , several other baked goods . secret convection baking degrees need lowered 25 . ( i.e. 350 325 ) i've only this oven few days , but i am very impressed satisfied performance power this toaster oven .	1

i went this fryer , ( replacement well loved much used unit ) , two basket feature . this reason first star . true , it take 5 quarts oil but frying 2 baskets one time . problem arose two baskets one time . temperature cranked up max 375 degrees , two one layer baskets chicken wings took over twice amount time needed fry greasy . second batch after waiting full 20 minutes assume maximum recovery those still fried much longer than needed time wise weren't up level old machine got them . clearly one immersion element can't pull off heating much oil . next fries . greasy . very greasy . again i allowed extra time oil temperature recovery . worse part heavy oil smell air . it required whole night leave kitchen made entire family shower immediately after dinner . we all felt like we worked double local rat trap . this unit doesn't replaceable charcoal filters but permanent metal one . it nothing absorb odors . this new oil nothing ' smelly ' cooked . only chicken fries . it returned store next morning after cleaning out , ( thus second star because it easy clean up ) . it traded rival . gave up half fry space but what incredible difference	1

addition all beautiful words said le creuset i want add several things i haven't seen anywhere else . first , oval shape pot this size preferable because it easier lift ( you hold pot closer your body ) . also it fits better oven . 5 pound duck fits perfectly 9 1/2 quarter oval pot just enough room left place some cherries or oranges around . second , le creuset became some sort cult ( i saw couple large french ovens emeril show other day . ) if you into french , cajun or just any rich cooking you just least one . third , price seems high , but then i saw some fifty year old le creuset ovens sold auction list 25% what they would cost new now . think it investment . forth , colors . i disappointed beginning find out they only sell this size white or french blue . but when i received my blue oval oven i loved color . picture catalog doesn't it justice . this large pot red ( my initial choice ) would looked like fire truck . i since added couple more blue pieces those who interested starting their tableware collection , this color coordinates beautifully denby reflex pattern	1
i bought this pot new used it once steam some fresh green beans . i shocked after using it one time , inside bare aluminum . dark grey " hard anodized " finish completely gone . my caphalon hard anodized cookware just gets better use . beware this phony product	-1
this mid-priced line henckel knives , called quot ; classicquot ; company , full-tang , single-piece , three-rivet line sturdy black plastic handles . handles notched end prevent hand sliding off during use . although they not razor sharp right package , their edges sharp enough average cook . according henckel , all knives this line dishwasher safe , but you should expect more rapid dulling under harsh conditions . slicer long straight blade curves up gently two-thirds way toward tip . tip extremely sharp , allowing exact easy puncture begin cutting . this knife balanced evenly blade handle make straight slicing more comfortable . this useful blade kitchen , it great both slicing melon carving meat .	1
.......... i paid too much these knives , though they work well . i should shopped around	1
very well worth cost(imho it worth far more than it cost ) . just wish i would seen knife like this hollowed edged earlier(i don't think amazon it , but it only $8 more different site )	1

after little experimentation water coffee measurement grind , this clever machine delivered rich , intense espresso minimal effort ( including cleanup ) . ( pace atypically disappointed reviewer , it " true " espresso : hot water forced through finely ground coffee high pressure produces , name would imply , espresso , although crema slight or absent , probably because microfilter . i've espressos wide variety machines domestic commercial , including one little eagle top , jerked them living more than once . aeropress not approximation ; it makes delicious espresso . ) components seem sturdy well-machined . i found steel chopstick easier stir than paddle-shaped implement provided aeropress . if you're no-throwaway purist , you may interested know microfilters rinsed reused indefinitely . they're too inexpensive seem worth effort , but it neat feature not mentioned online product descriptions	1

i agree some other reviewers unit runs hot side , but we've ours several years it still working great ! my biggest complaint it so good sucking up dust particles filter quickly clogs won't pick up larger items . then filter needs banged out order restore suction . it great vacuuming stairs cars small things ... but i usually bang out filter 2 or 3 times when doing stairs or car . kind pain , but same time it reassuring know it getting much dust out carpet . i would not use it big jobs , but think it works great small jobs . biggest issue trying track down replacement filters ... when i find them i usually buy couple	1
i purchased one these see if it would better than doing it hand ... boy it ever . it works even better than i'd hoped . clean up easy expected . my only complain would container plastic ; metal or glass would hold chill better , making better foam . but if you want , you use different vessel ( metal or glass ) would work fine , so my complaint pretty minor	1

rice our staple food - no kidding , it really . i all different kinds rice bins my pantry - long grain , brown rice , par boiled rice , sona masuri rice basmati rice . i cook rice everyday i never completely happy any one rice cooker all these years . i tried several different kinds , sanyo , aroma , zojirushi etc ., there always something each these , uneven cooking , big splatters , bottom getting burnt , so so forth . i finally got this one , recommended friend . * perfect brown rice , white rice pulav/pilaf . * absolutely no splatters . i intentionally put 1.5 cups extra water nothing came out - rice overcooked , but different story . * even though lid not detachable , cleaning easy . part it due shape ; fancy looking rectangular ones such pain . i'd say crappy design . * cooking vessel definitely thicker than most cookers out there . never burnt bottom even when left warm several hours . * i don't crank up my big oven baking small cake . this cooker it ! complaints really minor . * weak lcd display . * cannot cancel timer if you change your mind . you go increments all way max then start counting again . * not come bigger sizes .	1

i expecting this machine cook rice very well based previously owning neuro fuzzy logic rice cooker made zojirushi , which i've worn out after many years use . i'm very happy new induction heating style cooking . it cooks brown rice better . pro's--exceptional rice results , almost foolproof . -- multiple menu settings account most types rice , including gaba brown ( which supposed make brown rice even healthier) -- easy operate . select menu setting , add cups rice bowl ( rinse rice ) , fill applicable mark bowl , hit cook button . -- battery backup . lithium battery means cooker remember its last settings even if you unplug it . if you're creature habit , this feature makes it even easier operate . -- clock timer 2 time settings you set based clock time . like previously stated , cooker remembers timer settings until you change them . i leave my cooker set rice ready 6:30 a.m. ( pack lunch work ) or 5:30 . ( dinner ) . con's--water level markings pan based 6.2 oz cup provided ( ~ 3/4 cup ) . don't lose cup ! -- expensive ( my justification it saves me $5 every time i pack rice lunch instead eating cafeteria) -- takes longer cook rice than equivalent stove method ( baking or stovetop) -- timer military time only ( so when i said timer set 5:30 p.m. , it actually 17:30 )in summary , buy this machine if you want use timer function . if you're type person who only remembers things last minute or don't like plan meals ahead , keep your money get pressure cooker or good pot instead . it fits my needs perfectly , so i give it 5 stars . i also recommend zojirushi lunch jar system if you want use this make rice lunch work . lunch jar keep rice warm moist , so you don't microwave it .	1

i prefer eight-inch knife over ten weight reasons wide series gives lots knuckle-slide area repeated chopping tasks . i've owned wusthof-trident knives since before graduating culinary school over ten years ago . fact , i still own all but one i still use daily ( one stolen ) . knives hold edge better than any other i've used ( i've tried 98% what out there ) , stand up continuous use comfortable enough use all day long . you'll never sorry owning wusthof-trident knives	1
when aeroccino works , it works great . it quick quiet , produces excellent foam . clean up very easy . but , there something inherently unstable aeroccino machines . since august , i managed kill three them i am not sure why . part it nature machine : because it constructed like water kettle , one should not submerge it into water . but because it designed heat milk , manufacturer allows putting it under running water long bottom machine remains dry . if you get bottom wet ( you ) , machine either trips ( heals itself after fully drying ) or dies . i suspect , my first two aeroccinos died such deaths . my third one died today . i frothed milk it , refilled it tried again ( without cleaning ) machine not work . i tried again it worked 20 seconds stopped . i tried again couple hours later it worked 10 seconds stopped . i am not sure why it so , but i suspect it magnetic foaming brushes you must insert into machine make it work . if anyone ideas why this so , let me know . positive side i keep calling company they keep sending me new machines . i really like aeroccino when it works . but i suspect it good old microwave when i finally run out warranty .	-1

i like this knife , i really . however , it truly functional santoku knife , it scalloped edge so your food doesn't stick blade . handle also really light doesn't same heft or balance , say , henckels 5 star series would . small grip somewhat uncomfortable people larger hands it doesn't any texture so it difficult use if hands bit wet . this first knife i grab slicing up meat fact it keeps razor sharp edge nice . however , if you own one knife your kitchen , i would not recommend this .	1

i bought this set my significant other christmas . i looked around wusthof , global , few others but liked unique look feel these better . i also figured these would more comfortable easier wield female . end result she really enjoys them . although she fairly large hands woman , handles fit her nicely . knives come very sharp hold their edge long time . it interesting see how well they take professional sharpening . overall , i am happy i purchased this se t.t here one caveat . i also quite bit cooking large hands . after using shuns couple months , i come conclusion wusthof grand prixs fit me better feel sturdier . i cannot really justify two sets expensive knives around house , so we keeping shuns . my advice : go sur la table or williams-sonoma handle knives yourself . feel weight , notice handle shape , decide what fits you best . there so many quality manufacturers cutlery now it hard go wrong any selections	1

i really like my bodum coffee presses - i two sizes , delighted see i could replace beaker separately . but watch out if you order replacement beaker . my small one holds 3 what i think ordinary cups , so i ordered 3 cup replacement beaker mistake . looks like my small one actually 8 cup unit , my big one ( which hold 5 my cups ) 12 cup unit . there no info bodum itself how big it , so if you don't remember , it takes some guesswork figure out whether you " 3 " , " 8 " , or " 12 " cup bodum . study measurements carefully get closest match . oz held easiest way tell , but course if beaker broken you problem .	1

i've used this waffle iron 10 times so far - waffles , french toast or grilled sandwiches . it works fine . only thing i don't like it handle lifting top . grooves run front back when lid closed ( top bottom when it up ) . several times i trying lift lid handle slipped my fingers causing lid come crashing down . if grooves ran sideways instead , this wouldn't happen . i'm thinking filing some cross-wise grooves improve grip	1

this mug combines best elements thermos more traditional travel mug . when sealed , it not leak carried like thermos keeps my coffee hot until i'm ready drink it . use it mug easy pushing button top drinking . it doesn't handle , which i find annoying mug . it proportioned well terms dimension , its appearance compact . i've it few weeks , so i don't know how hardy it . most new items include plastic , it slightly creepy smell makes you wonder what exactly entering your body , but smell now dissipated	1

bodum tea infuser wonderful item ! whether you making cup tea or pot tea , infuser easy use , easy clean-up . one big downside company selling infuser not include lid - - it missing shipment . spite this deficiency , infuser itself works great - - since i seldom let my tea sit very long after making cup , lid not essential .. although it would nice view paid it . i find this infuser much better than those " tea eggs " filled , then screwed shut , opened same way dump out after use . carefully crafted stainless steel also sure last years regular use	1

i calibrated outside sensor using supplied probe container ice water . it appeared accurate within degree . default channel 1 interfered cordless phones ; resetting it channel 3 solved problem . if you need full complement remote sensors , this might become serious issue , depending what other equipment you . main unit hangs single screw . it requires use buttons its top look high low temperature records , reset them , switch remote sensors . pressing these buttons tends make unit rotate around screw ; i not yet figured out how solve this problem , unit come down replace batteries	1

while i loved features this timer , especially ability run multiple countdowns once ( i bake lot varying baking times require concurrent timers prevent errors ) , my unit started freezing ( apparently common problem this model ) after 6 months use . buttons indeed flimsy pressing them little hard often would cause unit reset itself , losing any all countdowns already progress . this unit not inexpensive ... i'd rather separate ' single ' timers next time , especially model not know freezing up . i dot not recommend this time	1

this board beautiful , perfect size next my sink , so far worn really well . it functions not only cutting board but staging area dishes after eating . i treated it mineral oil when i got it , which brought out grain even more . i highly recommend this one	1
i read lot reviews before i bought this most them weren't very good . i took chance bought it anyway because it easiest brand find store . my oven broken so i needed one these right away . i don't see what problem actually i love this crock pot . i didn't any problems it leaking or lid not fitting . heat seemed appropriate setting . maybe i got lucky ? price , i think this crock pot perfect . i wish they made this size programmable . i'm not really sure why they don't . would my only complaint but i still give it 5 stars because i got what i bought i'm very happy it	1

i really like this product , especially affordable price . here positives negatives i've experienced ... pros : 1 . boils water fast it quiet too . perfect office . 2 . great safety features . you really want cordless unit easier/safer filling pouring , auto-shutoff on/off indicator light work exactly described . also , spout mesh shield plastic guard prevent water splashing out while boiling . overall , no need worry accidents . 3 . plastic view-window volume markings both sides unit , so you see water level any angle . 4 . convenient storage : relatively small footprint , cord wrap base , minimize counter clutter . cons : 1 . it takes 2 cups water cover heating element , which less convenient if you just want cup tea . 2 . cord only 3 feet long . fine kitchen counters , but less so if you're using your office wall outlets/power strips . 3 . lid mine sticks one side , so i push snap it into place ( might just mine though ) . overall i really like this kettle quality convenience . you find pricier ones , but money , this one all necessary features then some	1

excellent quality rich color . i tried it skillet , takes while heat up . . . i think this would best oven roasting or saute onions , followed stove-top roasting . very heavy , course , lid , too , heavy enough hold juicy steam . this large piece . you could prepare meal four . you want smart how much you move this around . hand trouble , i've learned use straight wrists carry it close me ( when cool , course ) . then i take water or food piece , cook serve it right off stove . . . cool down , " hug " it sink . i used smaller pieces similar brand smaller meals . care , this should serve you life-time .	1

i just got this iron yesterday linens things using their standard 20% coupon you find all time newspaper . i tried it out cotton shirt got job down five times faster than usual , less work , no wrinkles . shirt looked like i got it back cleaners . i also elna ironpress , which also saves time , but i think i prefer using rowenta steam iron since it steams material while you iron it , it get into more nooks crannies . note rowenta engineers -- it would nice if water tank level indicator let you know how much water it . this would help when you fill it so prevent overfilling . option would removable water tank you could take over sink fill . also , if this typical high quality rowenta product , why only one-year warranty ? why not five or ten years	1

we using this heater over month now , it powerful little heater . i wanted get ceramic heater because i read they safest space heaters you buy . this important because you here lot horror stories space heaters causing fires . heater three settings low , high auto(ranging 900-1500 watts electrical power ) . low setting heater puts out 900 watts . we usually use it auto where you set handy digital thermostat set temp . unit maintains temperature , you either set it unit or using handy included remote control . i surprised see how well this unit heats 220 square foot space . i would recommend this unit confidence , my only issue unit not expect it save you money over other space heaters i.e. oil filled electric radiators . my electric bill seems gone up using this heater over previous oil filled electric unit same manufacturer . i say , this unit heat room much better then previous unit , largely due fan dispersing heat	1

i haven't completely gone through manual yet , but item installed first try quite easily , despite my setup one more unusual ones , both heating cooling listed exceptions part wiring diagrams . it works well intuitive enough interface i just set it up left it going . already saving me time money over my old thermostat . nice unit	1
i used this item 10 times total over four month period . battery not work all any longer . not buy shark product if you intend using it longer than few months . absolutely awful product life span .	-1
these my favorite cutting boards . cuisinart makes 3 cutting/prep boards , round , square rectangle . i bought them set all together , i use least one everyday . they dishwasher safe so clean up couldn't easier they not dull your knives , absorb odors or collect bacteria . they all slightly raised around edge so liquid not spill your counter , perfect tomatoes or anything else you chopping . i actually just ordered second rectangle one . you even use them outdoor serving , fruit , cheese , etc . highly recommended ! a+	1

hi .. if you reading this looking new or replacement filter , aquaclears great . my 70 ( 300 ) extremely quiet my aquarium crystal clear . even though filter comes sponge , carbon biomax , you set it up which ever way you want . sponges washed aquarium water save few dollars maintain your biological filter . cleans easily . old number represented gallons per hour . new number represents maximum size aquarium . good luck	1

i love these dishes ! proportions , color vibrance , surface wearability chip-resistance can't beat price ! i suggest buying few colors mix match , these dishes come so many great colors ! if you're considering lesser-priced set ( i ) , spend little bit more , extra quality classic style definitely worth it	1
not really , unless you add up what i would paid all coffee i made it , starbuck prices . but it more than paid it'self many , many times over . sure , it small , but people who complain it too small should realized they talking euro sizes , those darn europeans drink out some really tiny cups . microscopic , actually . i carry it me everywhere i go , it perfect size . i lost count how many times i used it , least ten million times ( not really ) . i love little rubber boot , which apparantely not microwaveable according one unfortunate reviewer , comes off so i sit it directly burner bunn coffee maker quick access hot water work . i also love secondary filter lid , once you get your technique down you never grounds your coffee again . this something cannot said other , more expensive brands french press . it well worth money i paid it . i say already ?? hell , price you should buy two case you manage break one , although they tough nails . i guess you could break it , nothing indestructible someone who puts their mind it	1

beriner not perfect mandoline but it more useful , more tasks than large french mandoline i also . it light , easily transportable used more professional kitchen stations than larger metal version . you throw out finger guard moment you get it . like any other tool it requires care . dish towel better finger guard you get bitter end carrot or zuchini . one drawback it not cut thicker than 1/8 inch . you could not push celery root through it or even tough carrot long way(you , but it requires poise ) still it only 30 bucks it lasts forever . outside dense root vegetables , it great . one my favortie tools , my vita prep , cryovac machine immersion circulator	1

we purchased this item after looking our options wine refrigerator . this model perfect size our needs . we entertain friends family kitchen/dining/family room open concept . cosmetically , it blends nicely without overly prominent attractive enough i wouldn't hide it away . it holds temperature , well , unlike prior smaller model . removal box some minor " assembly " racks handle took ten minutes before we plugged it began noticing thermostat reflecting lower temperature . i'd suggest this great gift or addition casual kitchen where space may issue . we very happy our choice	1
this set all quality good looks i expected . there only one problem-it big ! 11quot ; plates so tall my dishwasher they only fit center my kitchenaid dishwasher , so i can't wash more than 4 once , bowls don't slide prongs , but kind lean over , so they take up extra space . i got rio set partly because 16 oz . mugs ( my husband serious coffee drinker ! ) . i love design , but plates bowls really way bigger than any person normal-size appetite needs	1

i've using this machine good month now , i'm very happy it . while i'm no stranger espresso , spent many dollars my local coffee houses , this my first home espresso machine . it only took me few attempts get decent espresso , not much more get hang steaming / frothing milk ( not sure frother attachment , it ok , but i'm sure purists would tell me replace wand high end one ) . if you want real espresso , you can't find better starter machine . most cheaper models " steam " machines , resulting strong coffee reminds you espresso , but not real espresso . this one solidly built , brass grouphead portafilter , strong pump . boiler aluminum , but this advantage it heats fairly quickly . i usually turn it before i take shower , it nicely heated up when i return . if you don't like waiting , after 5 minutes you pull couple blank shots through , which should ensure everything heated well enough make espress o.o ne safety comment , very careful metal drip tray when cleaning it . when unpacking my machine there lot adhesive goo drip tray so i went sink scrub it off . it turns out , edges tray rather sharp i cut my finger it . since then i've bit more careful it haven't any issues , but normally all it takes quick rinse tray plastic tub underneath it get it fairly clean	1
price am not too surprised quirkiness this machine . others mentioned , there tendency it push out lot water one time not great job sucking it back up . this said , however , i've developed few tricks minimize these issues . 1)getting right angle handle takes while but once i get into groove , i find holding handle certain angles helps suction problem . 2 ) if lot water comes out once then i just push around instead trying keep just one small part my floor wet one time . it clean water tank so i don't feel like i'm just pushing around dirty water . then handle trick i'm able suction up water over larger area fairly quick clip . 3 ) if i don't patience or time dealing larger than desired volume water i just fill clean water tank half way get go this seems prevent problem . 4 ) i use murphy oil soap my wood floors . here , trick use fraction amount required bissell recommended cleaner . i use maybe quarter amount if i'm using murphy full tank water . i'll use even smaller amount if i'm using less than full tank water . not use too much murphy's; it oil soap too much causes dirty water tank fill overflow bubbles ( yes , i've learned this experience ) . despite quirks , my wood floors look great after i use this machine price i'm not sure i could expect quirk-free machine . if i space i'd buy heavier duty more costly machine , but my 790 sq ft apartment mostly wood flooring this ok .	1

i received this unit first week november 2006 . valentines day it toast ( no pun intended ) . first it worked fine . i used it warm end our big living room near front door where it almost always cold . i set thermostat 3/4 maximum left it work . it also completely quiet advertised . then , sometime january , i noticed on/off knob turning brown near edges -- if discolored excessive heat . i turned it off investigate . then turned it again . nothing . unit dead . after repeatedly turning it off i noticed sparking underneath switch . after repeatedly spinning switch off/on it would finally come back would stay 2 or 3 days until it failed again . after 10 days this i unplugged it out fear my family safety . now it waits my garage until i take trip dump dispose it . what giant hassle 55 dollar heater ! don't doubt second honeywell counts people not wanting hassle returns . example electronic device made cheaply possible little or no regard quality or safety . it cold day you-know-what before i purchase anything else honeywell . i better find me quality heater soon so day never comes . -30-	-1
i bought this pressure cooker after much thought research i just gone through very bad experience investing expensive pressure cooker [ manttra 5-pc . stainless steel multi-cooker 8-qt ] then it just stopped working all because its whistle went bad after just 3 months !! it heavy bulky complicated unlike presto ! so i simply looking light hassle free cooker which also didn't cost much . i finally found it presto ! its light weight , very roomy . i'm small sized girl [ 5'2 ] i personally needed something which not high narrow me comfortably cook it . presto not high or narrow all , its roomy giving me plenty comfort cooking ! its totally hassle free . i wash it dishwasher comes out just fine clean . don't over fill cooker i.e more than half cooker water which goes all pressure cookers otherwise it burst . also don't leave it unattended very high heat . instead try cook medium heat always . overall i love presto pressure cooker i bought i would recommend this others too . if you looking tension free light weight cooker , which also great bargain price , there it . its definitely worth more than money it costs	1

key keeping your beverage hot ( after you first make it hot , place it surface ) , lid coffee mug . i found coffee cups lids world market ( ala cost plus ) carlsbad , ca . kind chinese use formally , only 5 bucks . i think if someone starts making coffee mugs lids ( perhaps lid lifter like they use beer steins ) , it would sell well . my beverages stay way hot all day platform , long i'm using ceramic lid . thats key folks , use lid least heat stay it gets hotter liquid your cup gets lower . keeps my coworkers warmer , so hopefully less flu go around	1

i crossed my fingers when i purchased this cart because mixed reviews . worse case scenario , i'd just return it . i'm pleased say i am quite satisfied cart . i find it very sturdy ( bottom shelf holds up 44 lbs ! ) . assembling it , i initially put bottom shelf upside down ( lip should toward floor ) . this mistake made cart very unsteady , but soon i turned it right side up , everything came together like glove . it handsome piece lots storage space . i keep my crock pot , rice cooker , blender bottom shelf clear counter space . keeping these ' heavy ' items bottom shelf locking whells also steadies unit so it doesn't move when using sliding adjustable-height top shelf . i'd recommend it . hope you found this review helpful	1

we lot fun this fountain couple parties . it little noisy , but you won't notice it if it larger party . everyone loved it asked where i got it . i bought it bed bath beyond $40 using one their 20% off coupons come mail almost every week . i used semi-sweet chocolate chips ( tried nestle ghiradelli ) generic canola oil . i let fountain run 5 hours without problem . i noticed i add little extra oil when i first started get it flow smoothly . you also make sure it completely level . you make sure chocolate smooth before you put it otherwise it won't work . i overcooked some white chocolate chips when trying melt them . they wouldn't work . if there couple clumps still your chocolate after taking it out microwave , just continue stir until completely melted rather than keep putting it back microwave . that how i overcooked white chocolate . we used wooden skewer sticks many items . we tried marshmallows , oreos , nutter butters , dried apples chips , pretzels , fresh pineapple , kiwi , strawberries , peaches , marshiano cherries , piroette cookies , regular pringles . home we tried something fun - banana slices , strawberries cherries dipped fountain then used canned whipped cream - banana split . lots fun ! you really get creative	1

i've always curious this product , despite owning no longer manufactured bissell steam mop , when this went sale target , it magically jumped into my shopping cart . i 3 very active little children who like dump dish detergent floor then squeeze ketchup into mess . we two dogs cat , all which enjoy shedding amazing amounts hair . my house constant state chaos . anything enable me clean up sticky , gooey , dried bananas mountains pet hair more quickly ? i'm intrigued . we approximately 1800 hard flooring main level our home . some it tile , some it sealed bamboo ( like hard wood ) . all it quite regularly smeared yogurt . i own dyson which spoiled me other vacuums forever , so i highly skeptical vacuum feature this product . but i surprised . dry vac decent job . i tilt it back get it eat cheerios bits dry noodles , but it certainly picked up debris pet hair . it not get into corners up against cabinets furniture very well , but it fit under my cabinets which my dyson no t.t he vacuum quite noisy . encouraged dry vac results , i followed directions , mixed cleaner filled tank . i emptied canister collected dry stuff clicked over wet vac section . it just noisy , course . i started my laundry room . very short time i reached front my kitchen sink ( not even 1/8th way through my hard flooring ) , tank empty . well , that inconvenient . i refilled it wondering if i squeezing lever releases cleaning solution too frequently . i wondered if i could least get through rest my kitchen casual dining room ( all tile ) before reaching great room where bamboo flooring started this second tank . no go . i out water again time i hit dining room table . it took me three times long not even complete job normally takes me 30 minutes broom my bissel steam mop . hoover floormate least no effort push around , but i go quite slow , go over over over areas bissel could blow through seconds , since directions encourage you go over sections again ( without squeezing lever ) squeegie extra water up aid drying , it just took ridiculous amount time . it okay job cleaning , i guess . i think this product would ideal if you live home without ton hard flooring maybe without such active ( read : messy ) household mine . i'm thinking my mother would like this . overall : pros : - very easy push around , takes almost no effort . easy back . - okay job cleaning . not so great tough stuff like dried banana or apple sauce ( yay flung baby food ) . - low profile , fits under cabinets . - light weight . cons : - way noisy . wouldn't dare use this hallway while kids napping or asleep . - water tank too small or lever releases more solution than really necessary ? my bissell steam mop reservoir seems much smaller but i get entire main level tank half . - slow process . you go quite slowly get it clean really well . - no little side brushes like dyson so it misses crumbs pet hair up against wall or cabinetry . - obnoxious clean/empty reservoirs . maybe bissell ( i can't stop mentioning it ! bissell ! bissell ! ) spoiled me , but no extra solutions , no holding tanks clean . - my steam mop cleaned better , i finished job steam mop tired amount time it taking mixing expensive solution ( i realize others said i use other cleaning solutions ) .	1

my mom gave me this popper several years back ( i'm talking , several , when microwaves still novelty ) i still use it . i normally don't leave reviews , but i'm grad school now , without microwave oven , looking air popper saw some folks not given this popper love it deserves , so i must point out it beauty . let me start telling you i use zero oil , so concentrators , i bought two little bags ten ( they couple bucks each ) i've only ever used three them . long they're clean dry ( no oil ) you use them over over again . its bowl shape allows easy storage . pop concentrator disk out , dust it off , wash bowl dry it , store disk back bowl you even stack other bowls inside it . nice ! i also tell ya i hate plastics -- i won't drink plastic water bottles , i don't store my food plastic containers , etc , but this dry product , very little condensation lid make popcorn soggy . all , i find this thing absoluetly great ! it easy clean , lasts forever , if you get pack or two disks you'll probably never run out . ( i used one disk maybe 30 times)one downside : you need microwave that above 500 watts little dinky ones -- if you call your oven " medium " sized , then it work . i one those low low wattage ones it never could pop corn . worth every dime . healthy popcorn too -- no oil/fats/butter etc . takes 2:50 my oven -- there never old maid !	1

i went local bed bath beyond find silent or near silent humidifier . salesman introduced this air-o-swiss best machine market . he added venta-sonic same job but costs $50 less , all other brands can't compare . i bought both units compare . air-o-swiss clear winner , hands down . two machines sat side-by-side . it clear immediately everyone air-o-swiss quieter . even highest setting , air-o-swiss ' noise level frequency lower than venta-sonic , they blend nicely into background . they don't give me headaches venta-sonic . lower settings , air-o-swiss virtually silent . air-o-swiss , i slept very well . next night venta night . unfortunately , base machine noise just bad first unit i returned earlier noise problems . i tried go sleep it but after few hours , headaches agitation noise made me shut it off switch air-o-swiss slept through afterwards . i kept alternating units days nights observe results continued operation . after three days , venta-sonic unit began add strange squeeking noise . air-o-swiss gave consistent good near silent performance ... going strong still . just based noise-level alone , i return venta-sonic even though air-o-swiss costs $50 more . but extra costs further justified following : 1 . consistent performance - i put air-o-swiss automatic mode preset humidity level before i go sleep , when i wake up , my bedside humidity reader ( far away machine ) within 1% margin error preset desired level . venta-sonic however , i put it max settings , i get only around 32% sometimes other times anywhere below 50% . 2 . greater output capacity - my bedroom 300 square feet+ , half 600 both machines claim cover . air-o-swiss comfortably reaches my desired level ( b/w 40% 50%) lower settings ( it go high 75% , i only set it up 50%) . venta-sonic labors over 8 hours max settings gets me less humidity ! it won't get me above 50% . 3 . ease use digital control - i like air-o-swiss ' auto mode desired humidity setting . machine adjusts output automatically . venta-sonic only two dials , you'll experiment while find optimal settings . soon atmospheric humidity changes , which daily or few hours , you'd re-adjust again ... that like shooting darts dark all time , you get close if lucky but never target . 4 . better mist venting notch design - i put both machines 3-fee t-t all dresser . air-o-swiss ' notch tilted higher than venta . this means when operating cold mist , air-o-swiss disappears into air vs . some venta still hit floor - not enough form condensation but less efficient humidifying - perhaps contributes venta lower output previously mentioned . 5 . better craftsmanship - venta-sonic notch below air-o-swiss , appears made simpler cheaper . filter changes clean up similar . venta needs change filter cup . air-o-swiss needs filter cup once-a-year silver stick change . both fool proof . venta filters more expensive but air-o-swill extra silver stick . cost-wise it similar . i like air-o-swiss option replacing resins - just dump old resin filter cup put new packet you get new filter - this cuts cost almost 65% less trash environment . water tank design similar . both fills water upside down . i still prefer air-o-swiss because top more leveled , easier sit sink or bath tub than venta tilted top . when moving venta-sonic , water spilled base tank . i no problem air-o-swiss . anything air-o-swiss improve ? sure ! humidity reader machine adjusted 13% lower than actual average room humidity . they probably it ensure average humidity far away unit reaches target , but i think they so internally without show it . it would mistake read room humidity off machine . after i got machines , i googled both . there one review elsewhere saying venta-sonic broke after month half , out store 30-day warranty owner took loss . air-o-swiss 3 year warranty , if i remember correctly , venta 1 year . trouble i went through worth finding right humidifier me . hope this helps those similar concerns !	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . however , there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . buffet casseroles one most versatile pieces le creuset lineup . use this pan saut� pan , roasting pan , poaching , or shallow braiser . 3.5 quart capacity plenty space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tends best if least three quarters full . any less you may overwhelm your food evenly dispersed heat pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend use this pot basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , frittatas , deep dish pizza , casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 3.5 quart pan , feeding two out if it ridiculous unless you want leftovers . it probably perfect size family four most cases . try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding when you need please many guests , poaching fish , or mac cheese . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 12.25 pounds	1
. . . this glass , course , good tequila . resident mexico four years tequila obsessive , i tasted over 70 different tequilas ranging $5 $175 per bottle . riedel only glass allowed me fully smell , taste , enjoy tequila , only glass recognized consejo regulador de tequila , mexico fda tequila industry . my quest enjoy best tequilas lowest prices , i purchased cheaper wine flutes just every other glass i able find resembles riedel shape ; all , however , no avail : this glass singular construction unmatched tequila . unfortunately , these glasses not created equal : i owned 16 these glasses , , time time , i come across poorly finished glass -- unsightly stem seam , rough lip . moreover , this glass confounds all attempts describing color tequila . finally , these glasses not cheap , nor they very strong -- my two-year-old son i managed break twelve already . nevertheless , this , least moment , only way drink tequila . those search perfect tequila , i would like share some recommendations after spent thousands dollars my own search . but before i begin , i wish urge all tequila drinkers give serious consideration boycotting cuervo sauza . these u . . -owned megacompanies bought up huge amount agave mexico consequently inordinate influence production price agave , cuervo especially destructive . competition become very difficult other , less financially powerful producers , who going out business/selling off . depressing me cuervo recent acquisition don julio , whose 1942 among my favorite tequilas . before you buy these behemoths , consider what they mexican farmers , smaller tequila producers , ever-rising price tequila . now , few recommendations . keep mind price object me , i most my tasting mexico , so i not able try some very expensive tequilas or tequilas export only . also , note i not included tequilas impossible find u.s. no particular order , then , my recommendations : 1 . azulejos anejo ($90 per bottle ? difficult find , but worth searching out , this tequila among most flavorful best-balanced ( i.e. , agave oak ) anejos i tried . 2 . don julio 1942 anejo ($100 per bottle . okay , it owned cuervo now , it bit overpriced , its flavor strays agave , but exceptional complexity mind-blowing ) . 3 . el tesoro de don felipe anejo ( $36-40 , strikingly pure- full-flavored anejo , this tequila more readily available u.s. than mexico ) . 4 . chinaco reposado ( around $40 per bottle , solid , pure tequila , arguably better than over-the-top oaky anejo ; this tequila artesanal flavor ) . 5 . casa noble reposado ( i able buy this around $40-$50 mexico until , like increasing number tequilas , it apparently became available only export no longer mexico ; this tequila sells around $60 u.s. this tequila probably best nose any i've sniffed ; unfortunately , however , this tequila one those house flavors permeates every tequila its fabrica , la cofradia , makes , not everyone necessarily like ) . 6 . corazon anejo ( apparently export-only , selling u.s. anywhere $47-60 . this one better middle-priced tequilas , notable its balanced complex flavor , which edges out don felipe ) . n.b. perfidio back production . i bought bottle $120 mexico . some call this best tequila ever made , but i found it so carmelized , delicious it , it ceased seeming tequila . it , however , worth trying . enjoy	1

i'm using this unit my bedroom , which getting very dry some colder days this winter . it works very well . morning , before leaving work , i set fan low , humidistat 40 . when i get home , i raise humidistat 50 . when we go sleep , i turn it off . this because our bedroom very small even low , it bothers my wife . please note we both agree it very quiet low we able sleep it turned past . it could when it set humidistat , cycling fan ( off ) interrupts our sleep . days which not so cold , we don't run humidifier . while i personally don't notice variations humidity , my wife feels difference right away says air feels much better when it running hour or so . we've this unit little over one month it works like champ . water supply not 11 gallons i think -- would huge unit . but it plenty our usage . we fill every 2 3 days . buy extra filters protec pc-1 cartridges . there warm spell week half , during which we not use humidifier . it still winter , i not pack unit away or drain water . i checked filter before using it again found three pea-sized areas where mold just started . my opinion , this extremely good - i expect bath towels left this situation would entirely covered mold mildew . me , it means filter acts advertised -- microbial protection doing its job . since i extra filters , i decided replace old one anyway . paranoia set because we hadn't swept or mopped bedroom over three weeks because way air drawn into unit , i'm sure some dust near floor pulled caught filter . don't get me wrong - problem not design unit , problem we've negligent cleaning our bedroom . air drawn 6 7 inches above floor when assembled included caster wheels , which definitely high enough areas simply moderately clean . this unit meant much larger space ( our bedroom 12x12 ) it pump out lot moisture quickly quietly . all all , this excellent unit : high capacityvery quiethigh outputhumidistatinitial investment cost effectivereplaceable items inexpensiveblows moisture 270 degrees direction , not uni-directionallong electric cord	1
