i also bought this magazine sight-unseen i wish i hadn't . re-decorating purposes , i found this magazine not useful all . homes gardens pretty , but what they feature ( furniture , wall window coverings ) just would not go middle-class home ... way too opulent . i wanting more magazine could give me look found local or chain furniture stores ... not would try make me get one-of-a-kind table xyz antique store new york . also , i found this magazine text-heavy . all all , ok magazine professional decorater maybe , but not average home-owner trying redecorate	-1

home business magazine publication aimed those members general populace who either already own home based business or who active interest subject would like pursue it further . this magazine contains articles relating all facets home business ownership initial setup all way through payment taxes year end . i read several different business magazines many them entrepreneurship . home business only one i read specifically devoted starting business home , unfortunately , it many flaws prevent it enjoyable informative read it otherwise could . probably most annoying feature this magazine articles themselves their tendency written list- type format rather than user- friendly way . i realize people like lists but home business takes this little too far . it makes magazine seem callous unfriendly- something you would consult same way you would almanac . example , it common find one page article title like " effective ways design newspaper ad " , or " how obtain quick financing " . each instance , these articles short opening consisting paragraph or two followed numbered listing different methods/suggestions solve problem or answer question . this makes magazine read more like reference guide than piece reading material . thing annoying this magazine endless advertising . not only it get out hand , it also includes all sorts ads emphasize money- making schemes other similar material . advertisements titles like " really lazy guy incredible little secret idea make you rich " , " free $9.95 report shows you how make fortune " , " six figures six months " clutter pages this magazine get- rich quick garbage everyone knows unlikely return even cost introductory package . some parts this magazine more bearable than others it this handful positive attributes prevent me giving this magazine one- star rating . i like some success stories because they depict ordinary people who succeeded making living home- based business . but even here , stories inconsistent . some educational nature while others little valuable information share . make matters worse , they far too short- usually covering only one- half page each large advertisement taking up space bottom each page . speaking advertising , this magazine wrote book advertisement excess . advertisements cover 75 percent pages each issue it rare see even two pages row without some sort advertisement . ads posted everywhere , often right middle article , they distract greatly already limited enjoyment magazine . this magazine assembled together such way it reads like collection articles taken people different parts country shuffled around published one magazine . other words , this magazine no continuity it . it like taking short articles different business newspapers around usa then piecing them together into one magazine . starting home- based business goal many people set themselves there always need some good , timely information when you find yourself this situation . home business , unfortunately , doesn't perform its mission very well . if you dig deeply enough you find few good articles . but majority too impersonal too shallow ( not mention smothered advertisements ) make this magazine worth trouble .	-1

" spin " accurate name something like this -- lot hype , innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone dirty old geezer rock magazines , then spin teenager who tries hard convince you he cool name-dropping strokes . spin covers some same turf rolling stone blender , but less lasciviously -- lots coverage popular bands . some them quite good -- hives , example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job " blues clues " after hearing flaming lips album , reinvented his life rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands hot moment , then overemphasize them again -- well tacking them up whatever " coolest " / " best " lists they chalk up year/decade/century/history rock . indie cred maintained few half-page articles potentially hot bands like comas metric , but this info halfhearted . it like they're reluctant tear themselves away articles better-known bands , regardless talent . writing , however , certain affliction lot major rock magazines : need cool . their writers always trying funny , but rarely come across way . it seems silly strained , like soccer mom wearing spandex tube dress . even cd reviews mediocre . however , one recent highlight dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , little bit skewed . fact , they often best things entirety magazine . one problems emphasis stuff hollywood . scarlett johanssen wonderful actress , yes . but she doesn't sing , nor she appeared music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . what up party coverage tv starlet mischa barton mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under radar online kludge in-depth looks some worthy bands . spin ? it still trying convince us it cool , but eggers only regularly cool thing it	-1

anyone good taste music hate this magazine , it only rates bad bands bad genres good reviews whatever good bands listed , often given bad reviews . its all pretentious pop-culture drivel conformist , weak-willed mainstream american . worst part rolling stone 100 greatest guitarists all time list ; they highly rate kirk hammett , kurt cobain , tom morello ( all extremely overrated guitarists ) while rating eddie van halen very lowly #70 not even mentioning these awesome guitarists ; kerry king/jeff hanneman ( slayer ) , john petrucci ( dream theater ) , trey azagthoth/erik rutan ( morbid angel ) , jeff loomis ( nevermore ) , steve vai , joe satriani . if you know anything good guitarists , those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk , kurt , tom . don't read this if you're trying decide what good music , you decide what good music . think yourself , don't let mtv rolling stone think you	-1

interview definitely different type magazine me- someone who usually reads business travel mags- it not quite what i expected . title like " interview " i read my first copy this magazine anticipating pages pages nothing but interviews . it turns out interviewing main focus magazine , but it not only one . there substantial space given fashion , movies , other areas , too . some these columns worth occasional look , but they failed grab my attention . writers seem play it safe , includes interview section . they don't ask many daring or controversial questions . they keep it simple , asking questions entertainer latest album or movie , without delving much into their personal lives . interview many general annoyances . my greatest complaint advertising arrangement contents . half pages each issue covered ads , fashion , liquor , beer , hair care items providing bulk advertising revenue . ads everywhere , majority front pages each issue . table contents buried , i find this very frustrating . contents starts interviews specific issue one page , then few pages later , proceeds remainder contents , which regular monthly features . what annoying you search table contents . it varies one issue next , falling somewhere first half . interview also varies greatly length . some issues short 80 pages while others more than 200 pages long . shorter issues use staples binding while longer issues bound more professional way , minus any metal . this magazine centers entertainers , fashion , music , like . you won't find any interviews politicians , businessmen , etc . interview sticks strictly entertainers , includes regular monthly columns . you won't find column business side music industry or film industry . you find only articles stars themselves . interview only saving grace photography . it would make nice gift those who enjoy fashion who like looking pages pages men women modeling fancy clothing . but many ways , photos overemphasized there isn't enough substance magazine . articles very shallow more eye candy than reading material . overall , interview sloppy cluttered too many ads make it worthwhile reading material . my subscription free , i'm thankful it . besides few nice photos clothing , there isn't much make this magazine worth cost .	-1

flipping through pages writer digest local bookstore , i found some its content particularly useful interesting , especially those trade writing could benefit novice writer . so i decided subscribe magazine it only then i realise problems persist this seemmingly wholesome helpful magazine . since i subscribed online directly through wd website jan 2005 , i received only few issues . first few months almost half year , i received no issues all . it only later then when i e-mailed them they manage get some issues through me . annoying thing even though i e-mailed wd few times this problem , they would reply apologetically saying they extend my subsription . how this tackle root problem ? if they could not assured its overseas subscribers consistent service , they should not offered ' overseas subscribers ' option . ironically , i received their letter asking renewal my subscription recently my home address clearly printed front letter . logistic problems aside , magazine its plus points . issues , there useful tips writers not simply craft writing , but also business spiritual aspect writing process well . occasional issues also features insights into lives authors give us idea how where they work , their opinions life areas which they derive their inspiration . all this range authors range genres . essentially , business writing also not left out . however , magazine not one fraught without problems . problem wd information presented readers too limited scattered . each article though containing valuable tips writing , not enough depth really improve work authors if they really implemented . addition , because its range , it also not provide what some writers really want consistently , which waste time them read if they subscribers . sometimes , it seem magazine purposely limiting information they give readers order encourage further buying future issues . this example , seen amount publishers ' addresses they offer . most , each specific article particular topic contains average 7-10 addresses . there nothing wrong this , but why would author want waste his time bits pieces such information when he just purchase writer market collection publishers(and agencies ) addresses collected into one ? ironically again , same company publish ' writer market ' collection which excellent quality annually . said , same problem - lack information depth , also seen advice tips it gives well . make matters worse , every issue usually cluttered plethora advertisements frustrating readers times . writers want organise their time information , not add it . if you want thinking subscribing wd , consider alternatives currently available . writing craft requires more common sense acumen than many would like think . however , if you not particularly concerned little information fed you slower dozes or not too worried little more untidiness your life , than this magazine might you . but your research first	-1

first issue arrived today . after tearing up 8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult read magazine , i sat back enjoy . first article lecture robert . kennedy jr. danger mercury fresh water domestic fish . perfectly safe fish we informed ( well duh ) . just don't eat what you catch . expectant mothers should extra careful babies high level mercury lower iqs . net full peer-reviewed studies major universities subject mercury poisoning . why buy food magazine read what activist lawyer say subject ? next article : " politics plate " . controversy here concerns local season foods . gourmet asks : " those who promote them sincere ? or it just come gullible diners ? " so who gourmet think " gullible " ? reader ? implication seems reader too stupid figure out yes , vendors might promote locally grown products aren't all terrific . nothing substance this article all . going back front , editor gourmet recalls how her late father didn't appreciate health food stores ( aren't fathers stupid ? ) . three downer articles row . i gave up . this isn't magazine i remember 20 years ago . even format annoying . it difficult know where ads end articles begin ( recall most junked up website you've seen , gourmet model ) if you enjoy politics environmental stuff ( either side ) you better net free . if you want entertaining , informative articles food , gourmet not place look . subscribed saveur same time gourmet . it pleasure read . no annoying ads , no political screeds . great photographs . interesting exotic recipes . good or better than gourmet decades ago .	-1

i subscribed cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i problems issues failed arrive , wrote them it - never received reply or any note concern . since time , i occasionally glance through it newsstands see if there any articles interest . even dint casual glance , i've begun tire formulaic articles which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients order finally come up " perfect recipe " something or other . i now skip right " perfected " recipe , decide whether its worth committing memory . some explanations success or lack thereof inclusion or exclusion particular ingredient hare-brained bes t.t here also two other areas this magazine disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range just plain wrong idiotic . kitchenaid pro 600 hailed cook best its class many mixing chores . yet , amazon reviews tell different tale - one short lifespan when used mix bread dough because plastic gear cover deforms finally comes apart , allowing metal gears separate . christopher kimball ( editor ) once performed evaluation cookware which he calculated price cookware per pound its weight . no , i'm not joking . evaluation , le creuset came out top simply because it heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered not much heft , therefore judged pricey , pound weight basis . one issue cooks boasted its cover " unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others " . apparently , hershey designated best . not too many months later , callebaut recommended above all others , hershey judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there those dreadful editorials mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , punctuated picture mr. kimball wearing bow tie , looking very much if his head held it . mr. kimball humble man , much humble . he writes if he chanelling helen gurley brown , but red black flannel watch-plaid without her sense play . time re-vamp this magazine , folks	-1

i picked up issue this magazine last week because i wanted take picture cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up check it out discovered it most brainless magazine i ever seen . articles read like something " teen beat " , yet it filled adult material . there 10 articles " how please your man " " what guys like " even " sex workout " . these articles didn't contain any " real " advice -- just unintelligent babble . instance , any you know guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i don't see how anyone over age 16 could find any this stimulating , yet there too many articles one-night stands anyone under 18 read . but if you're still into taking quizzes looking " half-naked hunks " who barely hit puberty , then this magazine perfect . i would given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it not option	-1

i reader businessweek over 10 years . i noticed it significant change focus over last year . while there more articles " personal business " , hard-core articles gone way newsweek , u.s. news world reports . nature articles lightweight not reflect issues important decision makers today . like many others , i noticed political slant or agenda over last year . specifically , their commentaries economic analysis trend left . bob kuttner co-editor american prospect contributor boston globe . every one his articles begins premise president policies bad then followed tortuous rational thesis , include discussion days gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson better , but former clinton advisor , not objective her analysis . alternative economic opinions far few what opinions they tout , not agree numbers stated their own figures week . while bw potential great reporting based their resources , they let their editorial priorities get way serious business reporting . serious business readers students , i recommend going alternative sources . yes , i let my subscription lapse this year .	-1
i subscriber new republic several years , but waning years clinton administration beginnings bush ii administration , paper seemed take real rightward turn . now , i no problem so-called liberal hawks , but magazine slavish support war iraq face questionable evidence it me . addition , magazine spends more time bashing democrats not aligning themselves magazine professed centrist/liberal slant than it presenting true progressives ideals create thoughtful discourse among its readers . magazine forgotten its roots progressive intellectualism dissent favor safe , " new democrat " rhetoric . there better magazines our there	-1

this magazine given us gift subscription when our son born , but both my wife i quickly tired it . previous review pointed out their lack scientific research good bulk their advice their tendency misquote distort studies just plain irresponsible . magazine seems firmly stuck fantasy ' pc ' world lofty goals ideals your children very little real world application . articles disciplining your children read lines ' if your 2 year old hits his brothe rin face soccer ball , look him straight face , make eye contact tell him it not nice hit ' . thanks pearl wisdom . anyone 2 year old atest futility reasoning them . never would parents magazine advocate something might actually work like say taking all his toys away marching his butt corner where he gets stand say 9 years or until he adopted neighbors :) seriously , magazine writes fantasy land scenario where june ward parents kids act like munchkins disney tv movie . if you happen cleavers , go it ..	-1
this magazine almost bad consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere their thesis what tests measureing , example comparison test said quick acceleration point handling then car lack lust performance handling acceleration would #1 ranking . often , car reviews always mentioning information car isn't relevant , or doesn't make sense , or review isn't consistent posted viehicle stats . magazine also seems biased . some vehicles criticized more irrelevant information than others say its awful . after further reading many issues , you would think they playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs manufacturers , example , you always see domestic brand referred basically " trash " japanese brand or bmw always way go , when once again posted stats sometimes photos say differen t.t his more noticeable when you predict out come their reviews . ultimately , its bad guide towards getting any information automobiles period . its pat robertson auto magazines . if it possible , i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star .	-1
i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
time long increasingly superficial its news coverage , recent years only accelerated this trend . 60s 70s , it somewhat serious magazine centrist bend ( originally it considered quite conservative ) , but years go it degenerated into more more pop-culture fluff little substance . its part " liberal " media , this inaccurate . recent coverage ( 2004 ) election attempted reduce democratic candidate status non-person . first debate john kerry george . bush not even covered , except one very brief article listing few " fact check " points . instead , cover story wa new products movies , kind sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever election afghanistan . it mentioned passing article u.s. election , but i would imagine conservatives would object magazine ignoring signficant world event george . bush pointed one his accomplishments office . my view neither candidate received adequate fair treatment . bias seems favor mr. bush , but it still mostly bland superficial . your money better spent british magazine " economist " which far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint conservative , it sound fiscal conservatism rather than tent-revivalism currently substitutes conservatism u.s. politics . " economist " also provides liberal viewpoint closest i've found ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach news . time still entertaining read , but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously . they tend bend political wind	-1

i've subscriber this over 10 years i've loved getting this , but it undergone changes recently not better . specifically , i hate what they've graphical design inside . whereas they used employ several different styles when it came things like fonts artwork whatever subject written , now they've adopted uniform style where nearly everything looks same . it looked better before . writing isn't witty or sharp ( longtime staff departed ? ) , there " filler " pieces form moronic sidebars boxes - useless attempts humor simply don't work . strength magazine continues come critics , especially movie dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going consider letting my sub expire ' cos i don't let my mailbox fill crap like this	-1

great magazine . i subscription 2 years ended 6-8 months ago . i paid $104 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly price us skyrocketed astronomically . i go any music store or borders/barnes noble buy each individual magazine anywhere $8/issue $9/issue typically , i never seen it more than $9/issue . however , suddenly subscription they like $13 issue , which outrageous . it not amazon doing either , i subscriber 2 years this same thing happened me . they asked me come back lower rate ( something like $99/year ) , which still $8.25 issue . sure that might bit cheaper ( 25 cents issue average price above ) than buying each one store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially tthat price . upside uncut far away best music/movie magazine world . i'd say 60-70% issues i would bought store when i subscriber . but until they begin printing magazine states , it just not worth subscription . writing magazine superb . brilliant varied writing throughout . each magazine big small book too , them i'd read good 80% magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles artists i could care less , because articles so well written ) , but price way too high subscribe . it shame too . rolling stone nowhere close good uncut , although mojo strong , they can't hold candle it either . only blemish magazine itself ( all you who might want buy single issue ) covers tend repeat every 3-4 months , i mean how much beatles i read ( i'm upper 5% beatle freaks out there ) . still magazine well worth it , subscription price too incredibly high though recommend any circumstances . i would think this would great market move into us if i position . i don't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would away " free cd " bonus too . aside few listens novelty it all ( free cd good incentive make me interested few years back ) , cd get old quick , after while i would toss them out after quick preview . summary : wait until/if price drops , but don't subscribe . it too expensive , much cheaper buy each magazine individually . magazine itself though 5 stars almost always great	-1

i first subscribed gq when it still quarterly ... issue only every 3 months . back then it primarily men fashion magazine . it sophisticated , useful classy filled clothing men could actually wear practical grooming tips , trends style . i suppose many ways it resembled ralph lauren print ad . now fashion relegated few pages back magazine men wearing things they seem found local flea market . nothing seems fit properly , patterns - plaids - stripes ... anything goes . it resembles homeless couture . odds ends nobody should actually wear . sure world changed . but fashion , good taste , quality timeless despite tweaking contemporary preferences . editors may feel grunge , hopeless edginess it own sake adolescent sloppiness sell issues . but they might surprised there huge pent up demand sophistication real style , both formal relaxed . i hope someone else picks up torch .	-1

this magazine chock full supplement advertisements . advertisements fashion magazines annoying , but supplements unhealthy dangerous . these ads may something target audience magazine ... it seems directed women who hard core weightlifting fitness , level competition . recent article magazine talking what percentage body fat too low women . some women body fat below 10% - i'm trying get mine below 30% . it just different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness shape better because it sets more reasonable goals provides more reasonable advice . i substitute toast jam bagels cream cheese . i can't drink protein shakes breakfast lunch , eat 10 servings protein day , pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed this magazine ..	-1
i hopes this magazine would nice alternative others out there . moment i opened it , it felt so smug . i gave it chance read it cover cover ( april issue ) . but what finally me ( after read i could buy $800 blouse make me feel pretty after pregnancy stage , i could match my children shoes my jimmy choo finally i could buy my child latest $300 tricycle ) article entitled " normal " child who misdiagnosed autism . article discussed how distraught mother after her child diagnosed autism point she tried committ suicide . article ended fact child turned out genius . what point this article ? say thank god it wasn't true ? what those parents out there who autistic child , how this article make them feel ? article painful insensitive . there better ways spend you $10 than cookie	-1
i suscribed this magazine since i got great offer it company i get my other suscriptions so i decided , why not ?? its year , although previews each week prime-time programs fun ( 2 pages worth ) i very dissapointed . articles empty , boring some downright retarded ; rehashing show dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its mistery me how this magazine still around . i realize this entertainment magazine , but still , articles people magazine seem like rocket science comparison - gasp !!! yourself favor just buy tv guide - much more interestin	-1
i subscribed this magazine almost year now i become very skeptical much its advice . this advice seems heavily influenced its paying advertisers e.g. us dairy industry ( there always least one those annoying " got milk " ads ) not surprisingly , every issue there several articles magazine hype supposed benefits diet high dairy products ( e.g. milk cheese ) . however read many books nutrition , it become very clear me majority current research shows diet high dairy products actually very damaging your health - instance read china study colin campbell , extremely comprehensive nutritional study sheds great deal light us dairy industry its shady methods influencing public perception healthfulness its products . it well known there many better ways getting calcium etc into your diet than dairy but this magazine unfortunately blinded its advertisers ' paychecks . magazine also appears very similar prevention magazine which i also subscribed i would make same criticism . my advice stick reliable sources health like excellent " berkeley wellness letter " not supported or influenced advertisements drugs companies or powerful industry groups like us dairy industry	-1

i got this magazine gift , starting few months back . i really can't say i'm impressed . admittedly , i'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i still recognize good writing well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this isn't say i've never seen good point or anything , they're just fairly rare . if you want read well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this isn't it	-1
recently renewed my subscription after three year hiatus i couldn't believe my eyes . magazine skeleton its former self , slim stories little science . bob guccione jr mag not even fun read . happier side , magazine appears shun its earlier environmental preoccupations	-1
years discover best magazine lay person or even scientists who wanted keep track trends other fields science . now new publisher it become almost worthless . very superficial articles mixed over blown headlines poor science . after buying discover since it very inception i find it sad what happened this magazine . check dates notice glowing reviews old magazine but pay attention negative ones last 6 months	-1
i know apr supposed one better poetry magazines out there , i think it one highest circulations any poetry magazine , but it more national enquirer poetry magazines . it large , newspaper-style format contains mostly bad poetry dull articles . you'd better off subscribing poetry , hudson review , texas review , tar river poetry , or any number other journals	-1
this mag people who think they computer experts because they change out video card or follow directions changing os setting . shallow coverage , some lamest humor you ever come across . it nothing more then rehash what freely easily available internet . there nothing original this mag , ever . also it tends copy paste much issue 12 months earlier . all main articles nearly same every 12 months . don't believe me ? take two magazines 12 months apart compare them . reviews also weak . nearly every month you see : fastest system we ever tested !!!!! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even slightest computers knows speed not most important attribute , even gamers . besides , it really matter system . 00005% faster their poor testing system then computer ? second star mr halfhills column . it only part consistantly interesting only person there real technical know-how . read toms hardware whatever tech news you want , learn how use search engines , skip this pointless mag	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	-1
amazon ad said next day shipping . took over month first magazine arrive . not buy this amazo	-1
more more , all industry wants tell you what it you supposed like , ridicule anything we might consider guilty pleasure , if you indulge such thing , you ' shallow ' . music evolved past this attitude , no one believes this naked emperor anymore . oh yeah , their politics so mixed up , they don't even know what they believe anymore . i subscriber eleven years , my renewal notice came , i couldn't come up one good reason send it	-1
this used pretty decent music magazine . not best out there , but still decent . however , rolling stone taken huge nose-dive past ten or so years . i'm not sure i'd even really call it music magazine anymore . it more pop-culture magazine panders teeny-boppers . music magazine main focus should music , but rs over years started including more more articles tv shows , movies , politics , etc less less music ... especially less less good music . if you want magazine pop-culture go entertainment weekly . it , least , bit taste here there doesn't spout off politics . if i want politics , i'll read newspaper or watch cnn . i don't buy music magazines politics . i buy them music . if you want good music magazine , this isn't place look anymore .	-1
hi , i am writing this review attempt help you save $10 . this magazine embarrassment every angle . it full pictures " sexy " boys/men dressed cloths no guy self esteem would ever wear . pictures all there , you think there something interesting read , read this : there nothing this magazine read !!! latest issue contains 48 ( forty-eight ) pages before you get this issues contents . first " article " starts page 126 (!) " why man would like slice his testicles " ! totally magazine contains 260 pages there text ( letters forms sentences ) 40 them . besides this , magazine also huge dilemma gay magazine or not . well i go but i won't . unfortunately i subscription i am going see if i get it canceled , i don't even need my money back . take your $10 run them disposal , it more fun clean out disposal than " read " this magazine	-1
i bought magazin november , i don't recive it yet	-1
honest , i pick up this mag newstand 4 5 times year , but i hardly call myself fan . if you looking solid computer or tech mag , wired not you , it tries too hard hip trendy , but it group left/lib nerds too often come off lame borish . wired needs " rewired " meet needs modern tech community	-1
wired magazine proven me something it never even occurred me imagine : there level cynical , style-whoring , inaccurate , myopic snarkiness goes beyond merely " trading substance style . " wired consistently behind curve these days , but doesn't stop publication spinning every article like golden truth you too lame know . articles controversial subjects , one side routinely saddled straw man arguments so blatant artless i find them offensive even when i disagree parties who set up fall . just often , features which don't discuss contentious topic still edge them , making fun person , group , or idea way isn't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted subject matter . generally , wired mean-spirited it self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily demographic tech wonks it industry tourists professionally personally deflated bubble burst , desperately trying assert their relevance relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content easily outweighed sheer volume half-truths , shoddy reasoning , straight-up falsehoods which could easily revealed corrected casual investigation subjects treated pages choked high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . isn't world technology interesting magical enough without mixing spin , double-talk , factual misrepresentation presidential debate impotent , absurd bravado battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough how tech rules world how it , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize technology promise educate its current future potential . instead it concentrates one-shots written style passes " hip " forwards attitude rather than message , emphasis sensationalism over accuracy , more common advertising than edification	-1
regardless quality magazine , it really annoying see oprah every single cover ! make it worst , she not pick " regular oprah shots " , instead you look every issue front cover ask yourself " how they take picture ? she doesn't even look like her ! " it if oprah telling all us " see how i look like ? " every month just new testimony oprah , money wonders . top , oprah personal thoughts , things , favorites , ideas , even more pictures all over few pages not advertisement . i still gave it 2 stars because time time you find good article , but bottom line question : this magazine or show off ?	-1
american photo began magazine devoted more photography than gear , alternative gear obsessed magazines like pop photo photographic . it evolved into magazine divides its pages equipment obsession cheesy quot ; glamourquot ; photography tries art delivers soft core porn . no stars	-1
two years ago , vanity fair not only best magazine year , but maybe all time . i would read it cover cover . now , sadly , it bunch fluff . quality really gone downhill . i am going let my subscription run out . i really miss old days	-1
i trashed issue when i saw shot trashy paris hilton . there enough nudity already your publication seeing sad piece work ( her ) cover just turned me off completely . sorry you thought her ' cover worthy ' . probably missed some fine articles . sincerely : deane everett	-1
i've this magazine past year used several tips , activities , posters , etc . however , i also gotten endless emails mailbox promoting products asking me renew way advance . this continues though i asked them stop . last three or four weeks , they've calling me telephone every day . this continues though i asked them stop . few good ideas each $6 issue nowhere near worth trouble dealing this harassment	-1
people magazine one worst expressions american life . instead makiing our own lives more meaningful exciting - which possible - people encourages us oogle fixate over people who essentially images , people we never meet , many cases people who very little going them . anyone really think britney spears anything say anything , or paris hilton barely aware her own existence ? it ever make whit difference your life how many times . lo engaged ( order get cover magazine ) or who demi moore grinding today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	-1
this magazine shows negative side black men . i find magazine embarrasement african-american community . it seems out all races men world , black men seem want display their lack self control , their love fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which no way helps create wealth our communities . i am also offended this magazine rarely shows black women front cover . until , black men understand this kind pathetic display supposed masculinity stopped , they always stopped police , passed over employment , looked down upon . i wish someone would create magazine black men which shows positive side black man such leaders their community , showing respect love their women , showing everything not hip hip !	-1
this magazine might good if you wealthy enough not work , time work out four hours day , your own chef , could go vacation six months out year , or could afford ( or cared ) fashion . otherwise don't bother . they sometimes decent or interesting article but they so few far it not worth it	-1
don't get me wrong , occasionally there issues i still read cover cover , but it seems though mj gone through change lately . gone focus travel fantastic adventure writing . now focus seems health , fitness diet . i used buy men health magazine those topics . if i wanted focus i would continue buy mh . there no longer consistent reason read mj regular basis anymore . man , i miss old mj	-1
i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , honestly it huge disappointment me . there so many ads this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice save your money different magazine .. i dont recommend glamour all .	-1
this magazine reads like inflight magazine : something airlines , careful not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out lull their readers sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . don't you wish someone out there would publish really good magazine books ? one featured meaty stories well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ain't it . it dull bland . occasionally it offers up conservative book review neocon writer catherine seipp , who enlightening bill o'reilly ( , entertaining offensive laughably stupid ) so this sometimes cut dull . but someone here said bland i agree . avoid this one if you iq above 90 . pick up new yorker , atlantic monthly or harper if you like read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries other badly written pieces fluff -- which all this magazine covers -- this might just thing you . i want my money back	-1
i not yet recieved this magazine , how could it reviewed	-1
i received this subscription trial , found it one most boring publications i ever read . last few issues i got , i wasn't even looking pictures anymore . there drawn-out descriptions their views finer things life , which very materialistic . end every issue there pictures quot ; real-lifequot ; wedding announcements . perhaps this fitting your local newspaper , but it struck me out place magazine	-1
articles " good " but articles wordy doesnt get point . too many annoying ads . if u want something " read " this isnt magazine yo	-1
i received my first " issue " modern bride mail yesterday . it just cover magazine , nothing else ! now i'll go through trouble ordering replacement . yourself favor just go news stand buy one	-1
if you're teenage guitarist want learn nickelback , green day , nu-metal songs , then this magazine you . there also some pretty good tips beginners time time . but last several years quality feature articles interviews gone steadily downhill , there far too many ads . many people said , sometimes it doesn't seem geared towards musicians all anymore . smarmy , " hipper than thou " rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style writing seems taking over mag . other styles music such blues , country , jazz , etc , pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you're teenager you see it newsstand there song it you would like learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine	-1
okay , so touch never claimed anything other than what it : glossy tabloid . but just when you didn't think it possible american tabloid press dumb down any further , came touch weekly us weekly . all touch really bunch photographs . their writing slop , fit second graders , it doesn't go into much detail ( we all know how amazingly " accurate " these tabloids , anyway ) . want quality tabloid ? read hello ! magazine ( england ) . - donna di giacom	-1
two months after ordering magazine i yet receive single issue	-1
heft page quality this magazine impressive , but it mostly advertising . very disappointing . it some useful info i enjoy reading it ( which why it got 2 stars me ) , but i definitely won't renewing my subscription	-1
if i could give this no stars i would . i bought this magazine because nickelodeon programs my sons favorite watch . i bet they banking when they made this sorry exuse children magazine . not even half magazine ad free !!!! i bought this keep my son busy flight , he looked it maybe two minutes . i wondered why , since he loves everything else nick , so i looked inside myself . boy i dissapointed . instead quality children material i hoped , it just ad after ad . i'm glad i only bought one issue airport , instead one unfortunate people purchase entire subscription before seeing it lack content . if you want great children magazine , go ladybug younger children cricket older children . they both high quality they aren't stuffed full advertisements like nick	-1
one year subscription this magazine not renew it . simply because its vulgar materialism extreme . they say we americans obese body , but magazines like this show many also obese when it comes materialism . page after page glossy ads things we not need . rooms full what amounts dust collections . sure they make pretty pictures , but who wants all ' junk ' probably no real sentimental value but more what someone else told us we need feel whole or successful . i recommend magazine dwell which more holistic approach place live also wont mean hours cleaning . someone who professes so concerned down trodden , oprah would better set better example living simply . how many homes one american need , when so many americans cannot afford even one	-1
i echo same gripe other reviewers voiced here : magazine covers same handful people week after week after boring week . how many times reader going see no talents such jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , tom cruise-katie holmes joke , most overrated , overhyped people all time brad pitt angelina jolie cover not get tired it ? it nice know what going certain celebrities once while but every single week ? you say " overkill ? " i'm glad i never got subscription this magazine . i picked it up every once while newsstand but stopped because i so sick tired reading overrated , overhyped glorified b-movie " actors " " actresses " who lucky one successful movie haven't anything value since . i picked up copy today sworn it off forever . don't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom	-1
i don't know what heck going your subscription service . i bought this magazine my nephew back july 9th , he still hasn't recieved issue !!!! i am extremely disappointed your service . it should not take this long get magazine	-1
interview definitely different type magazine me- someone who usually reads business travel mags- it not quite what i expected . title like " interview " i read my first copy this magazine anticipating pages pages nothing but interviews . it turns out interviewing main focus magazine , but it not only one . there substantial space given fashion , movies , other areas , too . some these columns worth occasional look , but they failed grab my attention . writers seem play it safe , includes interview section . they don't ask many daring or controversial questions . they keep it simple , asking questions entertainer latest album or movie , without delving much into their personal lives . interview many general annoyances . my greatest complaint advertising arrangement contents . half pages each issue covered ads , fashion , liquor , beer , hair care items providing bulk advertising revenue . ads everywhere , majority front pages each issue . table contents buried , i find this very frustrating . contents starts interviews specific issue one page , then few pages later , proceeds remainder contents , which regular monthly features . what annoying you search table contents . it varies one issue next , falling somewhere first half . interview also varies greatly length . some issues short 80 pages while others more than 200 pages long . shorter issues use staples binding while longer issues bound more professional way , minus any metal . this magazine centers entertainers , fashion , music , like . you won't find any interviews politicians , businessmen , etc . interview sticks strictly entertainers , includes regular monthly columns . you won't find column business side music industry or film industry . you find only articles stars themselves . interview only saving grace photography . it would make nice gift those who enjoy fashion who like looking pages pages men women modeling fancy clothing . but many ways , photos overemphasized there isn't enough substance magazine . articles very shallow more eye candy than reading material . overall , interview sloppy cluttered too many ads make it worthwhile reading material . my subscription free , i'm thankful it . besides few nice photos clothing , there isn't much make this magazine worth cost .	-1
flipping through pages writer digest local bookstore , i found some its content particularly useful interesting , especially those trade writing could benefit novice writer . so i decided subscribe magazine it only then i realise problems persist this seemmingly wholesome helpful magazine . since i subscribed online directly through wd website jan 2005 , i received only few issues . first few months almost half year , i received no issues all . it only later then when i e-mailed them they manage get some issues through me . annoying thing even though i e-mailed wd few times this problem , they would reply apologetically saying they extend my subsription . how this tackle root problem ? if they could not assured its overseas subscribers consistent service , they should not offered ' overseas subscribers ' option . ironically , i received their letter asking renewal my subscription recently my home address clearly printed front letter . logistic problems aside , magazine its plus points . issues , there useful tips writers not simply craft writing , but also business spiritual aspect writing process well . occasional issues also features insights into lives authors give us idea how where they work , their opinions life areas which they derive their inspiration . all this range authors range genres . essentially , business writing also not left out . however , magazine not one fraught without problems . problem wd information presented readers too limited scattered . each article though containing valuable tips writing , not enough depth really improve work authors if they really implemented . addition , because its range , it also not provide what some writers really want consistently , which waste time them read if they subscribers . sometimes , it seem magazine purposely limiting information they give readers order encourage further buying future issues . this example , seen amount publishers ' addresses they offer . most , each specific article particular topic contains average 7-10 addresses . there nothing wrong this , but why would author want waste his time bits pieces such information when he just purchase writer market collection publishers(and agencies ) addresses collected into one ? ironically again , same company publish ' writer market ' collection which excellent quality annually . said , same problem - lack information depth , also seen advice tips it gives well . make matters worse , every issue usually cluttered plethora advertisements frustrating readers times . writers want organise their time information , not add it . if you want thinking subscribing wd , consider alternatives currently available . writing craft requires more common sense acumen than many would like think . however , if you not particularly concerned little information fed you slower dozes or not too worried little more untidiness your life , than this magazine might you . but your research first	-1
it took forever this magazine get address it also shipped week 2 weeks after magazine already stands . what point subscription if you get magazine later than everyone else ? i never order magazine amazon again , i'll go through actual magazine company instead	-1
but that lowest we're allowed give . this magazine more 16 year olds up . too much focus getting boyfriend making out - every 10 year old top priority right ? plus my daughter found extremely crude language latest issue - magazine refused discuss matter when i emailed called them ! says it geared girls 8 up but that huge age span . better off american girl magazine - this one mature younger girls .	-1
if i see picture blurred waterfall or creek i am going puke ... i not seen one truly imaginative , artistic image this magazine . everything run mill , boring , standard outdoor photography . lots sunsets , flower fields . no different angles or perspectives , colors , nothing new . articles geared toward inexperienced photographers really repetitive . i think i clipped one interesting article year worth magazines ..	-1
national enquirer gone off deep end beyond point common decency . now attack sweet , wonderful , charitable guy like clay aiken very very sad . go after celebrities whose lifestyles sensationalized one thing , but go after quiet humble guy like clay . now what ? he supposed justify their existence defend this garbage . their story ludicrous they owe clay , his family , all his fans big apology . i not buy this filthy rag or any american media products ever again	-1
i heard good things this magazine so ordered sample . it lovely magazine , beautiful photos it interesting reading " other coasts " ( besides east west ) . but , least most recent issue , every article families or couples their coastal homes people all caucasian . even advertisements only white people ( save one vacationing mexico some cute mexican children it ) . while i doubt this intentional , i would encourage publishers this magazine put their attention this issue . there plenty people color living coast who interesting homes lives readers would enjoy learning	-1
full ads , hardly any content all . not worth paying it .	-1
friend mine got me subscription this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine nothing but ads snazzy expensive foods restaurants . there so few recipies it i wouldn't call it ' cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they don't explain why they chose ingredients used or give much detail all . if you consider yourself ' foodie ' who likes go fancy restaurants likes know what hip latest gourmet food wine , then this magazine might you . if , however , you like cook know what you doing why you doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .	-1

this magazine part murdoch empire . its worstsin its boring not very conservative . it founded william kristol , john podhoretz fred barnes tobe institutional conservative publication under tight controland deep enough pockets dwarf its smaller rivals . when conservativism living movement , it best characterized collection independent voices who while they respected each other didn't always agree witheach other . now , following murdoch formula , its aboutgetting many people whatever their ideology payroll . price payroll course not rocking boat . reading conservative publications these days like readingthe transcripts someone engaging monologuein echo chamber . its strange there so much " conservative " media today , but most policy decisionsdon't get debated or even discussed among conservatives . they seem more interested covering liberals than discussingideas or making proposals . god sake , no more articlesby those who agnostics their private life talking how america needs more god this or god . if yourgoing religious , least find someone who sincere . no more articles greatness family childless unmarried women who totally devoted careersto exclusion anything else .	-1

there time when liberalism connotation deep thinking , tolerance , openness healthy , civil debate . no longer . harper perfect symbol all ails left . call this magazine " left leaning " farce . it doesn't lean ... it completely , totally , enthusiastically , blindly tumbles falls into " far left " swamp . tone often hysterically shrilly partisan , reflecting ongoing deafness disconnection leftist media elites towards mainstream america . quality writing feature selection declined precipitously through recent years . this rag credible now guardian , national enquirer , or , come think it , new york times ! save your money , lol !	-1

please see tj-mccarthy review elsewhere here ; he , borrow phrase across pond , spot-on his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere new editor , jim louderback , dropped old tagline front cover , " independent guide technology " . i conjecture reason doing so this magazine no longer independent , fact , just marketing vehicle various products . if you like me you not like stealth marketing , stay away this publication	-1
i just cancelled my subscription recommended my daughter cancel one i bought my 14 year-old grandson . some reason ziff-davis marketers think full page ads selling sex videos appropiate pc magazine . ( dec 27 , 2005 , 122 if you want check it out ) . previous issues partial page ads selling " sex pheremones " which i could almost overlook , but full pages scantily clad lap dancers over line .	-1
this magazine great just keeping spirit . it filled many success stories . but hardly any those success stories include details led them into success . it also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , every other ad franchising . i one year subscription this point i'm bored . i'll keep subscription , but it highly unlikely i renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site entrepreneur.com . you find it total opposite magazine , prove great wealth information	-1
my mom subscriber newsweek years , i'd flip through her copies . most material friendly towards powers ( although , not friendly enough according review soldier who thinks editors should jail . so much " protecting our freedoms " ) . anyway , since newsweek beholden big business advertisements , it won't much rock boat our corporate mafia owns . if people interested more honest , more critical views political economic system causing so much devastation world ( neoliberalism us empire other wealthy nations ) , then i'd recommend magazine . i'll never forget finding my mom floor devouring it articles range issues corporate media marginalize . also publishes articles interviews most-cited living author planet , noam chomsky ( figure i'm sure us soldier thinks should jail . although , chomsky recently spoke west point . so , even military waking up hard truths he brings ) .	-1
i would agree preivous comments state this magazine isn't worthy its title . i subscribed before reading review , i hoping find affordable psychology-based read , though some stories interesting i'm sure i'd able find them other magazines like vogue or cosmo . there plenty ads , probably more than stories . much like other reviewers when i first ordered it , it took forever first issue arrive , now its more regular but my subscription soon end no renewal course	-1
great magazine . i subscription 2 years ended 6-8 months ago . i paid $104 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly price us skyrocketed astronomically . i go any music store or borders/barnes noble buy each individual magazine anywhere $8/issue $9/issue typically , i never seen it more than $9/issue . however , suddenly subscription they like $13 issue , which outrageous . it not amazon doing either , i subscriber 2 years this same thing happened me . they asked me come back lower rate ( something like $99/year ) , which still $8.25 issue . sure that might bit cheaper ( 25 cents issue average price above ) than buying each one store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially tthat price . upside uncut far away best music/movie magazine world . i'd say 60-70% issues i would bought store when i subscriber . but until they begin printing magazine states , it just not worth subscription . writing magazine superb . brilliant varied writing throughout . each magazine big small book too , them i'd read good 80% magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles artists i could care less , because articles so well written ) , but price way too high subscribe . it shame too . rolling stone nowhere close good uncut , although mojo strong , they can't hold candle it either . only blemish magazine itself ( all you who might want buy single issue ) covers tend repeat every 3-4 months , i mean how much beatles i read ( i'm upper 5% beatle freaks out there ) . still magazine well worth it , subscription price too incredibly high though recommend any circumstances . i would think this would great market move into us if i position . i don't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would away " free cd " bonus too . aside few listens novelty it all ( free cd good incentive make me interested few years back ) , cd get old quick , after while i would toss them out after quick preview . summary : wait until/if price drops , but don't subscribe . it too expensive , much cheaper buy each magazine individually . magazine itself though 5 stars almost always great	-1

if i could give it zero or negative rating i would . when vibe introduced , it relevant , interesting magazine exposed me new alternative , rb hip hop artists . mag featured all kinds artists not just who hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles relevant not only hip hop community but world . lately i've noticed it nothing more than fluffy version source . i hate lot new rap music that out didn't appreciate mags rappers i dislike cover . it me or it seem like since mimi took over , all female rb singers ' covers stories horrible ( we won't even discuss disgusting brandy cover) ! this magazine sucks now only time i check it out while i'm line grocery store . yes , subscription rates cut bone now but because quality supremely lacking . i'd advise curious check issues out newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money subscription	-1

i subscribe parents , parenting child magazine renew all but one child . it full ridiculous fashion spreads ( like i'm going spend $50 t-shirt my 15-month old ) , useless travel information near-advertising features newest , most expensive items i ' need ' my child . actual articles no better or worse than what other mags , i don't find there nearly much information magazine others . other reviewers said , it beautiful . however , it thoroughly impractical unless you're one those people who plan shop neiman your child ... not there anything wrong	-1
during 1960 , when my sister subscribed ahmm , stories mirrored fantastic television show ; stories primarily mysterious , creepy , unique , lots murders twist endings made show so great . now , majority stories magazine plain , uninteresting " detective " stories . i subscribed up until early 1980 , but stopped because same old boring " cops robbers " material . i tried read recent copy while waiting my aunt beauty shop , but switched one media rags instead when discovered ahmm hadn't changed . subscribe only if you fan pure " police " fiction	-1
i picked up issue this magazine last week because i wanted take picture cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up check it out discovered it most brainless magazine i ever seen . articles read like something " teen beat " , yet it filled adult material . there 10 articles " how please your man " " what guys like " even " sex workout " . these articles didn't contain any " real " advice -- just unintelligent babble . instance , any you know guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i don't see how anyone over age 16 could find any this stimulating , yet there too many articles one-night stands anyone under 18 read . but if you're still into taking quizzes looking " half-naked hunks " who barely hit puberty , then this magazine perfect . i would given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it not option	-1
once thought women health magazine , cosmo taken twisted turn into pointless redundancy . one point , cosmo seemed must-have , water oxygen . more more lately , it seems magazine posing question " how we survive only water oxygen , still sexy while we ?

don't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine newstand . trust me ... there no worthwhile patterns ( i mean ... just look what they choose grace their cover !!! ) i stopped hoping even half-way decent pattern come during two years or so . i seen litteraly only one knittable pattern last three years ( december 2004 i believe it ... lace cardigan beaded trim ) . even articles pointless . save your time money get subscription interweave knits or vogue knitting . or opt new magazine ( not available all newstands us ) called simply knitting , which imported uk . it amazes me this magazine even still production how horible it !!	-1

regularly read " bicycling " many years ( even when it called " bicycling ! " tasteless 1970s way ) , i find it surprising see how much quality magazine declined . spite all those people spending huge amounts money fancy equipment , " bicycling " become thinner thinner . it recently improved somewhat , after most editorial staff fired , sign dropping truly horrible marginal comments ( bike love so forth ) but it only suitable real neophytes . unfortunately , there no other single magazine covers racing , bike touring , test reviews , technique fitness north america , no matter how poorly . articles very short sometimes , well , just stupid . there very little cycling destinations or serious equipment tests . photography remains decent , but compared german magazine " tour , " example , " bicycling " pretty sad effort . if you read this , you access internet , which means you far better sources information draw . i am letting my subscription lapse advise you save your money . big disappointment , " bicycling " not advanced its readers	-1

i seen many craft magazines come go . i hope this one goes . granted , there no commercial advertising it , but paying anything over $1.98 per issue would too much . crafts mainly useless , juvenile , lack polish . i purchased my subscription sight unseen because it through supporting local school ( only saving grace this whole experience ) , but mistake i not make again . it took least three months after ordering it i finally received my first issue . i opened it great expectation finding original practical crafts my home , but immediately thoroughly disappointed . thankfully , my subscription expiring soon . if you serious crafter , i recommend passing this one .	-1
i am 14 . i used read this two half years ago . it pretty good magazine back then , health tips , some real life stories , even things like sex questions ( which saying alot more than some these other magazines . ) it wasn't packed full teenyboppers cheesy glitter makeup . i liked it , if it still way it , i'd probably still reading it . but now , it gone . i read my last issue one year ago gave it up . it got way young me . all they talk celebrities ( aka jojo , good charlotte , hilary duff , jesse mccartney , usher , etc . ) alright , two them make some passable music , but what others ? they're talentless ! plus , i not see anything would appeal anyone over age 13 . they refer guys " hotties " " babes , " they just put same person every five pages ! there stupid quizzes tell you your kissing type or how psychic you ( seriously . ) half magazine huge posters your room airbrushed teeneyboppers . if you want magazine real substance , try seventeen ( highly reccomended ) , cosmogirl , teen vogue , maybe teen people ( i don't know , it kind lost its fun factor . ) some these magazines may not " appropriate " people read this magazine , but i personally think it better young girls learn hard honest truth world than obsessed pop stars latest mary-kate ashley gossip .	-1

subscription point view ( $12/yr directly ) this magazie decent value . while half information fluff ( looking back - 15 years innovation , etc . ) there some timely relevant information hard find easily consolidated way . focus not just laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals , pdas , mobile phones among others . there some opinion ( riaa vs sirius ) but focus seems vendor/advertiser driven . example , cover story mar 2006 issue first four core duo notebooks . they review centrino duo notebooks acer , dell , gateway hp . they run benchmark tests provide charts , etc . fairly useful info . except they don't give information consistently . weight dell laptop not even mentioned while those others . they mention few cons each notebook but it gently without strong opinion . two four systems reviewed selected editors ' choice . other two still rated well . there no single table compares them all single view . you get feeling , they trying please advertisers avoided any direct head-on comparision multiple products . i disagree their choices well . how could editors ' choice 6.6 lbs laptop acer average battery life just because it offers some value ? same mar 2006 , there review windows treo 700w ; showdown slim phones moto razr v3c samsung mm-a900 ; short test nokia pocket internet appliance kodak first dual-lens digicam ; wifi routers ; list restaurants business travelers ; etc . $1/month , i recommend this anyone who travels lot looking quick update mobile computing world . if you want in-depth technical info , stick toms hardware or other web sites	-1

someone who recently become more interested healthier , organic way life , i decided check out several magazines subject matter . many not strike my fancy . example , i found organic style magazine little too fashion product-oriented my taste , while mind , body , spirit fitness seems little too redundant doesn't cover natural organic living all . natural health , however , falls somewhere , covering nice array topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , food/recipes . someone who not interested explicitly holistic medicine naturopathy , i appreciate diversity this magazine offer . though many articles cover ideas products aren't entirely natural or organic , i still find them useful . many items articles , though not all , vegetarian-friendly well eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one my few complaints articles short , sometimes merely " glossing over " many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it decent jumping off point further research . though i can't compare previous version magazine everyone else seems preferred , i only began pick this up my local whole foods market last year , i say i am impressed what natural health offer it readers . sure , there several ads plaguing pages , but i still feel though there far fewer advertisements than many magazines shelves today . besides , some ads led me decent products i would not known otherwise . furthermore , this price , how anyone really go wrong	-1

there not many magazines specializing political commentary really any good these days . so many them geared toward political party , instead concentrating issues most important . " reason " magazine exception , its motto " free mind implies free market " vice versa , it proven publication one count objective analysis under umbrella motto . authors who write it definitely their biases , but they attentive these biases , usually anticipate answer objections ideas which they expound . many times this reviewer heard authors editors reason " socially liberal " but " fiscally conservative .

quite frankly this only cooking magazine i ever subscribed i actually looked forward using receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! format magazine makes it easy follow recipes - they always printed two pages across each other - unlike some other posters i prefer black white format so paper thicker doesn't tear easily . tear away ads ( their own products ) outside magazine means usable portion doesn't take up much space my shelf . recipes easy follow usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there usually also substitution listed . their product reviews terrific - i wish i hadn't wasted so many dinners bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , someone who not dishwasher , great number bowls kitchen tools recipes require . i made least half recipes magazines , many several times , which no small feat " flexitarian " who never meat main dish .	1

okay , it not one fancy , traditional mags but i found loads things generated ideas . sections showing design elements carried through house my favorites . it may advertising end spectrum some regards , but i liked seeing similar ( but different ) approaches same design goal various manufacturers . all web addresses made it easy me follow-up designs i liked , i didn't worry editors trying curry favor their advertisers pontificating merits one item over . i'm visual learner this fit bill . unlike reviewer who would suggest this due my gender , i think people respond differently same presentation material . don't write this off because it not marquee magazine -- try it first . you might just like it . way , i read like magazines books no pictures , too	-1
i only got first issue , but it seems focused more poets than other writers ( hence name ) . i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction . they might well keep two separate , especially contests events . it attractive format very upscale , high quality literature reviews advice . stories well written enjoyable , although i think writers digest offers more fiction writers	-1

my initial reaction this magazine this magazine huge , full ads . i also read vogue , though , honest , less ads it . convieniently avoids snotty air harper bazaar vogue while same time avoiding trashy how sex up your man type articles cosmopolitan , redbook , marie claire , it also avoids rampant celebrity worship instyle . this magazine excellent layouts , what i've read thus far , excellent-and very different-stories . regular vogue reader , i'm used reading older designers like coco chanel , versace prada lines , reading small smattering socialites , like aerin lauder , paris hilton , jemma kidd , victoria traina . what different it profiles new modern . article september issue profiled kate spade her new line . other articles talked , almost sarcastically latest exploits socialites , meanwhile talking , article aptly titled " bag called it " trend statement purses their proper place . also similar vogue addition good layouts , it even better photography , there no photoshopped death photos here , if they , this student can't find them . what i like most its sarcastic wit , something lost most magazines , many which these days assume everyone wants learn latest way sex up their man , worship teri hatcher , or read dumbed down articles .	1

this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	-1
one funniest magazines around . recent article , weekly standard proposed massively expanding irs help pay massive debt budget deficit . which group " weekly standard " say should targeted this increased irs presence ( massive increase tax rate - some 100%) ? entertainment industry . reality tv show contestants , teen-pop singers like . article noted normally massive taxation would hurt industry , but all people really want fame , go all out get their 15 minutes fame , industry would continue ( i'm curious if o'rourke realizes tax would applied similar writers ) . o'rourke article provided readers alternate inaugural address bush ( subtitle : " what if george . bush weren't compassionate conservative . . . " ; quote : " media say i won election strength moral values . if other fellow become president , would media said he won election strength immoral values ? " ) . all seriousness , this magazine very clear detailed neo-conservative look issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear many writers used liberals ) . magazine not always present just conservative perspective , not always agree bush . recent article current liberal , ex-communist british writer his reaction george galloway testimony before us senate . editorial recent issue all dictator uzbekistan , us ally war terror . editorial notes toleration this dictator his brutality undermine bush current foreign policy . it should noted magazine not seem journalists , few staff writers , most appear called " contributing editors . " it jarring , though , when i read magazine then read articles some my other subscriptions . " variety " " weekly standard " rarely agree . matter , i'm somewhat surprised how often " weekly standard " " business week " disagree . - michael . briggs -	-1
no ads . large print . beautiful illustrations . interesting age appropriate stories . every magazine this publisher ( cricket , etc ) all quality magazines child centered . my daughter five . i think this bit young her but she loves it ' reads ' it cover cover . she also enjoys looking pictures well . this worth every penny .	1
i've off-and-on subscriber si since i kid . i've grown love magazine idolize few staff writers . despite best , magazine far perfect . lately , i've found many articles deal things i , many sports fans , probably don't care . they give too much coverage pro football when it season , even though i've noticed football coverage among worst magazine . there few writers who i can't stand ( die austin murphy ! ) some who think they better than they really ( rick reilly ) , some who underappreciated ( steve rushin ) . however , some finest reading i've ever sports illustrated . there some stories stick you years . si beats crap out terrible espn magazine , which seems more interested comedy than sports .	-1

when weird tales revived around 1988 , i sorely disappointed direction editorial staff taken . it too " progressive " not enough like old wt so many us afficionados knew loved . lin carter great thing going four paperback issues he came out under zebra imprint early 1980 . unfortunately , he not allowed continue . his idea keep flavor old weird tales alive , he it very well . then several years later comes schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt , my goodness it sad see aura gone . gradually , though , wt seemed come put itself somewhat more direction " old-fashioned " ' zine it its heyday ( 1920's-1930 ) , although editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree this observation . anyway , wt sports great covers now , good stories , good book reviews , interesting editorials . i must say i miss s.t. joshi always very entertaining book reviews , but we can't everything . scott connors ' forthcoming reviews surely entertain , douglas winter . all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine support cause fantastic literature , especially dark fantastic ; there so few outlets this kind now whispers weirdbook , not mention long gone forgotten fantasy , no longer published . good job , mr. schweitzer , whether you realize it or not , your magazine become more cozy , old-style , aesthetically pleasing magazine , more true tradition original weird tales , thanks no small part wonderful covers graced it last 13 or 14 years	1

this magazine great beginning intermediate digital camera users . i think it especially great beginners . there articles how choose right camera your purpose what all specifications mean . there question answer sections answer broad range questions including how avoid common computer errors how format different digital devices . i like photo editing tips , which explain some more elusive aspects most digital photo editing programs how use them . photo-editing program described most often adobe photoshop photoshop elements ; however , quick advice also give how apply these tips other programs . more advanced film camera users , there tips how make same quality image digital camera stories professional photographers who switched digital . however , most professional photographers use macs edit their photos rather than pcs more advanced photo editing software . mostly this magazine caters amateur photographers lower end photo-editing programs most often used . there also reviews new gadgets , which often fun read , plenty market place like advertising back . this magazine what it advertises nothing more	-1

revolver competing magazines heavy metal magazine world hit parader circus . i bought all three these magazines several times , revolver my final judgement revolver only magazine good enough subscribe . other two i still buy occasionally , but only wallpaper ( i cut out pictures bands magazines hang them my room . ) this magazine , way , like combination circus blender magazines ; it combines best aspects both . revolver still plenty great pictures , but it also much longer much better written than circus . it not quite long or stuffed full information blender , but make sure you note revolver only reports one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances , if hard rock band ( especially big name hard rock band ) or already released c.d. , revolver story it . stories/reports very entertaining but they also informative sometimes lesson learned them . if it cover story , interview band also included ; if it not cover story , writer integrates quotes answers band into article , anyways ( even though it not formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go tour band ( i.e. lamb god ) . case , they take reader backstage , tour bus , concert ( rundown show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there sexual theme it . there would picture " hot babe " t-shirt , one side poster would woman-usually half-naked-in sexual pose . past year or so , revolver phased out ( probably appeal broader audience ) . i sometimes miss pictures " hot babes , " but this way there more room real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex isn't theme anymore , revolver probably bit too sophisticated anyone younger than teenager . plus , there usually profanities ( mainly " word . " ) so , i would say this magazine ages 13 up . monthly articles : -cover story-3 or 4 other biggish stories- " fresh blood " column ( where small biography given band you probably haven't heard of)- ask vinnie ( column where readers write questions , pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice)- hard rock news notes- black death metal news notes- " studio " ( update bands currently recording new music)-free poster ( middle magazine , there fold-out poster one or two bands . ) poster isn't very wide , but it two pages long-free music downloads- " ink spot " ( story musician favorite tattoo)- " favorite sh*t " ( interview musician , questions such " what your favorite color ? " )-joke band ( revolver just recently started doing this)- reviews ( reviews . . ' , music dvd , video games)pros : -- plenty good pictures free poster -- professionally written well known writers ( yet it not too intelligent teenagers) -- edited well ( i haven't found any mistakes or typos)-the " fresh blood " column usually introduces me band i haven't heard , but i should probably check out -- revolver accredited well known enough allowed go tours bands first interviews -- news columns ( both mainstream underground metal bands)-the stories always quotes band report -- free music ! ( revolver started doing page gives reader password , which he/she then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions interviews ( they ask up date questions , sometimes- i.e. interview puddle mudd-the writers aren't afraid ask daring , cutting questions) -- " studio " segment always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they don't automatically praise every heavy metal . . ) cons : -- if you're up date your music news web sites , news columns shouldn't really anything new you . -- not all . . ' reviewed ( they give rundown c.d. article band , but . . ' bands cover magazine aren't usually reviewed . ) -concerts aren't reviewed-my biggest gripe it only issued once month . bottom line , if you're metalhead , this best magazine you get ! it more than well worth ten dollars you spend years worth entertainment	1

i use this magazine my three kids ( ages 9 , 11 , 13 ) who homeschooled . they love magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks they get really experience what life like certain era . each article includes discussion questions , activities , movies , web sites additional books read . what so great this when one kids really interested something , they jump off explore more their own - perfect self-directed learning . it saves me time tracking down this stuff . some more memorable articles ones like " how storm castle " , " hobo signs depression " , " success ancient china " " how chocolate conquered europe " - definitely not standard-fare topics , but fun nonetheless . my kids getting hooked history result ! sure , it $5 per issue , but it pretty thick ( 60+ pages ) no ads . you check out sample issue online their web site see if it right your kids	1

i long time subscriber vogue knitting , it one few us knitting magazines really fashionable knitting patterns . i am germany , where there lots knitting magazines really chic patterns , i missed when i moved us . however , i find content vogue knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it packed great designs , sometimes , it just too far out there wasn't single pattern i wanted knit . i stopped my subscription while . then editor changed now magazine somewhere middle - not too funky , yet still chic fun . i still enjoy reading it every once while . after my daughter , i changed my subscription family circle easy knitting , since vogue knitting not carry any patterns babies or kids , which i really find shame . i even wrote letter editor saying this major omission . especially because it very hard find chic elegant kids knits magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns bears them ! german magazines great job some unique , but still fun kids designs . if you want very trendy knitting magazine uses whole range yarns ( some very expensive ) , then vogue knitting magazine you . if you looking elegant knits more functional , but still challenging , i would suggest interweave knits rebecca ( english version german magazine ) , both carry some really interesting challenging patterns . if you kids , there isn't much out there , i would suggest family circle easy knitting , also rebecca kids issue once year , which should not missed	-1

there two good ways tell what audience which woodworking magazine aimed . first type advertising , second how much skill projects expect you . it pretty clear right away woodworker journal server home woodworkers who already moderate skill . advertised ' big toys ' run 500 1500 dollar range , although there couple high end combination machines adds well . articles expect you know how use tools trade but not sure ' best ' way something . recent issue makes study intarsia backed high chair some interesting joinery , instructions making genuinely exotic angle jig table saw . writing solid reasonably illustrated , but they devote little space what you should already know , which make these projects stretch tyro . magazine very tool oriented . there isn't lot space devoted hand tools or history . expect articles comparing nail guns helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment right you . however , traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due . i found woodworker journal suited me quite well , i expect continue reading it	1
i love this magazine it helps me pick out style when i need it	1

workbench magazine aimed do-it-yourself type people who like work their own home improvements save money process . this publication presents dozens woodworking ideas home improvement few hobby , plenty instructions diagrams make sure you get it right . most workbench focused exterior one home . you page through issue , you notice plenty articles building wooden decks , new porches , other decorative ideas improve outside appearance your residence . there few projects inside , usually dealing construction cabinets , bed frames , other things . but most part , articles deal outdoor woodworking tasks . i like photos this magazine because projects always look so fancy . they perfectly constructed , clean , well- finished they make you want get off your booty start working your own home . many cases , articles this magazine tend make things seem little too easy when , reality , these projects often take many days or even weeks finish . but end results worth it not only financial standpoint , but also sense pride you feel job well . workbench little more expensive than other magazines , but those who enjoy working their hands , this publication worth cost . some effort some good ideas , you greatly improve your home appearance value some new outdoor trimmings . workbench shows you exactly how get job plenty woodworking projects enhance your residence inside out .	-1

i've subscriber outside magazine several years , it seems go through its ups downs terms strength its editorial content , especially regarding political side environmentalism . it still easily most informative magazine out there lovers outdoors , but just note focus active , not armchair , appreciation nature . beyond occasionally great always heavily knowledgeable product reviews , key strength this magazine well-written strongly researched articles outdoor issues concern , not just america but around world . outstanding recent example , among many , concerns economics environmentalism conservative western u.s. this type strong conservationist reporting usually only found otherwise books . other more whimsical articles just fun read those off-kilter interests , such recent pieces urban rock climbing or sauna fanatics finland . many other articles could classified more travel/tourism than adventure , but accompanying photography always top-notch , editors knack finding out-of-the-way hidden treasures around world ripe discovery adventurous . ( but other hand , magazine could faulted contributing recent trend hyping previously unknown outdoor paradises since become crowded , such molly sods wilderness west virginia . ) personally , i would like see little less focus expensive vacations extreme sports fanatics take hard-to-reach nations , more what folks more realistic means ( amounts free time ) humble parks forests near home . but despite its habit losing its focus times , i continue fan outside years come , might just travel some those hyped exotic adventure locations .

i ordered back issues this magazine ebay dealer uk after spring 2006 issue came out i am sold not just burda plus but berlin fashion designers well- women , anyway , make lovely , flowing but not " girly " clothes very wearable - think eileen fisher or flax but darker , richer colors , fibers textures , slightly more " fit " more interesting shapes wider variety -- not just same few repeated again again . clothes decades , not season -- patterns here ! least some them , designers like evelyn brandt , doris strietch ( berliner ( female ) whose name escapes me moment , but whose clothes i deeply admire . ) fit better than most american pattern companies - especially pants . if you make one garment each issue subscription more than paid itself . good info sizing patterns up or down back issues i recently received - keeping proportions if using " petite " or " tall " pattern if you neither . pattern directions themselves less than enlightening , though - perhaps " non-fluent " would best description their translation . breathless tone ( lots exclamation points !!!! ) editorial content seems bit much such " smart " clothes , but we're not buying this elegancce writing ! reviewer complained delivery delay . this only published january july . if you missed subscribing time last issue print run gone , you wait until next one pubs . print runs sell out . i attest	1

play definitely breath fresh air someone who truly engulfed second-hand suck . years magazines like egm , gamepro ( shudder ) , only multi-platform magazines i would read . i later became tired their increasing ridiculousness , both content reviews , so after suggested i check out this magazine many fellow gamers i decided , hesitantly , so . i mean how different could multi-platform magazine ? very . not only am i captivated wonderful choice cover art each month ( amazon should change display cover over shadow colossus one ) , but pages size publication more professional than any gaming mag currently out . ( i admit not read game informer , due their paper mario : thousand year door fiasco , i never intend . ) i could only think myself stupid not heeding words others sooner . my first copy issue 39 , march 2005 , sega choice cover main content month . wow , there content . nice spread sega upcoming lineup , interviews company people/developers captivated me more . reviews awesome , still awesome well , sometimes spilling over 2 pages more frequently than " competitors . " i knew right away this what i looking : magazine liked all kinds games wasn't afraid show it both previews reviews , magazine not insult my intelligence , nor choice games . i not seen one word " kiddie " or " baby game " attack because colorful sprites , or lighthearted content . quite contrary , magazine seems ardent its protection 2-d games , games just fun regardless how they look ; something very welcome this day age gaming . i also like how they some biting criticism , but still seem upbeat . take their 2005 e3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything show itself , phantom games , specs next-gen hardware , but still positive things say them . not only , but magazine , once again , incredible coverage . how some interviews people such : hideo kojima ( metal gear ; boktai ) , tomonobu itagaki ( doa ; ninja gaiden ) , atsushi inaba ( viewtiful joe ; okami ) , koji igarashi ( castlevania ) , michael ancel ( rayman ; beyond good evil ; king kong ) , takao miyoki ( phantasy star universe ) , masato maegawa ( ceo treasure) ? simply incredible . not mention their brilliant cover story shadow colossus interviews developers . i cannot say enough how good this magazine . if i could use my years knowing gaming mags , sum up what magazine like , i would say it like cross now gone next generation , gamefan its anime section -- but very much mind its own . ( those worried anime section , it located back , so you won't miss out anything gaming related if you choose skip over it . ) i seriously implore you give it chance , even if you fan other magazines . go your local bookstore look through it , you don't purchase it , just see yourself . hopefully , you'll experience true difference play	1

business 2.0 one few business magazines i read monthly basis , just recently extended 2 years . one most valuable aspects this magazine their analysis bleeding edge companies - i don't want limit my reading case studies best practices biggest , most obviously successful companies . i want know what startups doing , what oddball companies new ideas doing differently . not everything going apply , but since your own business must constantly evolve , i like magazine focuses constant changes variety businesses . why four stars ? honest , when magazine purchased its current parent company couple years back , i feel quality took bit hit . i don't care new design , though i'm sure it saved few dollars . number/quality articles also slid bit . but all all its still one better business magazines out there , far best " new economy " sector	-1
i subscribe few magazines , most which somewhat longwinded tedious . progressive not follow path . it also very informative magazine . example , one article i learned following items democrat john kerry :( 1 ) he gets good bit money telecommunications industry lobbyist " mintz , levin , cohn , ferris , glovsky , popeo " . ( 2 ) " he sponsored legislation help telecommunications companies buy up public airwaves . " ( 3 ) he thinks " we should all `smart cards ' - electronic ids our health history encoded them . " ( 4 ) he " voted every free trade pact come his way senate since cold war . " ( 5 ) afl-cio backing kerry even though he declined answer there questionnaire trade . all these came one article : " triumph bland " ruth conniff ( page 12-13 issue april 2004 ) . if your like informative information , check out this magazine	1

i reader 20 years , but am considering canceling my subscription ( i this once before when it became vanity fair look-alike under tina brown ) . i think writing exceptional . my complaint issues become thinner ( embarrassingly small " double-issue " mid-august ) . articles shorter edited end bottom page , which sometimes breaks article flow . it full advertising , which pays bills , but now seems squeezed out some writing . articles also not seem essential they past . political writing great movie reviews lane denby best you find .	-1
i subscribing new yorker five years now , it very enlightening experience . new yorker its part covering big news stories , but it not really news magazine . perspectives unique ( admittedly lean left ) , kind you're not likely get elsewhere . authors use first person because they tend part stories they're covering . take jon lee anderson , probably most credible reporter covering middle east today . his " letters " various cities involve accounts his meetings locals leaders . other segments more like npr stories -- unique perspectives largely uncovered topics aren't time-sensitive . you'll get in-depth looks into developments medicine , law , architecture , etc ., otherwise wouldn't get your radar unless you profession . , writers incorporate " larger questions " stories focused recent events . like malcolm gladwell recent account playwright who plagiarized material former article written him . he parlayed his personal struggle into good summary legal ethical positions use or development one person idea . i grown look forward reading fiction selection each week . sometimes i don't like piece , but i enjoy getting chance read writers i normally wouldn't those i normally would . additionally , magazine added more dedicated issues -- most recently " food " issue , addition standbys like " style " " fiction " issues . i loved " food " issue , especially one writer account search truly authentic pasta involved work night mario batali kitchen trip italy . i enjoy balance hard news , balanced interest stories , arts new yorker provides . i began my subscription get different perspective than what i got local southern news , i keep it same reasons many more	1

there different types film magazines . many how-to . others just give same blurbs over over rehashed rehashed . this magazine uniquely targets specific era when this short films there best few exceptions due today capabilities . magazine take only hand full topics or subjects full spread them . this magazine more filmography or focused biography just happens magazine form . accompanying black white photos relevant subject hand . just one articles would pay whole magazine .	1
i'm happy i ordered subscription this magazine it not only matches , but surpasses content provided foreign affairs journal . student discount rate i received ( official foreign policy website ) most reasonable price . each new issue fp contains barrage perspectives numerous topics very relevant today . photos , graphs , charts also help breathe life into each article helped me better grasp content presented . this content also available subscribers online , addition " web exclusives " " fp blog .

popular photography imaging well-deserved reputation one best photography magazines available , yet it not nearly well-written or informative it prior its merging modern photography ( if you interested checking this out , compare current issue one written back 1970 example . ) . it remains useful its product reviews , but these - especially lenses - tend rather subjective , not nearly critical potential user might wish . worse yet avid amateur or professional photographer , articles tend aimed towards novices , or least written though they would understood best only novices . only redeeming features herb keppler thoughtful insights photography occasional articles which well written edited . otherwise , i would recommend taking look other photography magazines , most notably shutterbug , which i found more useful	-1
i subscribing this mag couple years , think it one best gaming mags available . i several different consoles , appreciate they review games all platforms . i like rating system ( 1-10 ) instead too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , find reviews well written objective . while i gaming years , i am not necessarily versed computer lingo , but i never feel like idiot after reading this mag ; writing erudite but very easy understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , feel this magazine strikes exactly right balance more serious more frivolous gaming magazines industry . one suggestion : if you gamestop or affiliated store your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . $15 you receive 12-year subscription , card gives you 10% off used games these stores , well extra 10% trade-in value your used games ( sometimes there coupon month mag upgrade 20% both ! ) .	1
there few magazines writing serious writers need read . " poets writers " one them . it literary bent , but avoids nose-in-the-air attitude . it practical educational , pleasingly presented . favorite factor me long feature articles culture writing . issue out now , there two major articles . one author stuart dybek his fiction pulls his experience growing up chicago colorful south side . other writing contests , dealing how ethical they run , view literary judges , when writer should considering entering one . secondary articles informative useful , whether you want learn promoting your book , doing online workshops or understand trends driving industry . contests , incidentally , big part pw value . magazine tells you who won , which contests/grants currently accepting submissions . pw careful screen which contests listed , ensuring only legitimate ones make it through editors . writing itself interesting . it not always true writing magazines fun read . it should , case pw , everything engaging . pw design clean . it looks like what small press literary magazine should look like . typography layout not pretentious or overbearing , but get job . it never work read this magazine . i fully recommend " poets writers . " you better informed writing writers , just like titles implies . anthony trendleditor , hungarianbookstore.co	1
we subscription 2001-2004 . last year subscription , magazine came focus more more politics , most political articles written conservative perspective or assuming neoconservative world view background . letters disagreeing anything robert kaplan wrote rarely , if ever , printed . ( though i know fact they received them ! ) we dropped our subscription picked up new yorker instead . conservatives however may want take new look this magazine . reviews suggesting it liberal must based pre-2003 reading . occasional issues we bought since dropping our subscription confirm conservative slant persisting . quality writing still reasonable however , it explores issues depth ( albeit one side )	-1
mr. hayek apparently despises free thought . furthermore , his ignorance libertarian philosophy clear ; discounting his opinion appropriate . i'm guessing he republicrat finds socialist ideas found corrupt two party system satisfying . funny considering his namesake , frederich hayek , one greatest libertarian thinkers all time one my personal heros . but , i digress : reason magazine my mailbox every month well over 20 years i would buy lifetime subscription if i could . not every issue five star issue , but whole reason most interesting periodical market . said , reason dropped notch quality ever since brilliant virginia postrel left editor post several years ago . she true intellectual kept reason consistently high level . i still love read my issue every month while i don't always agree positions i am always stimulated	-1

finally magazine knows cottage . cottage isn't country , although it some those elements . it isn't necessarily small , but it . it doesn't necessarily mean old , though it . country modern hip or antique traditional . above all , it casual comfortable . it place you want come home . it feel , ambiance , flair putting things together don't come room-to-go packages furniture store decorators . i especially like various styles presented each issue -- ultra modern , traditional , log cabin , seaside , california contemporary , etc . monthly comparison styles one furniture grouping . it allows you grab ideas entire spectrum cottage style mix match yourself . i also like how easy how-to advice follow . paint advice luscious gardens interesting food , this magazine it all . accompanying website great . products paints easy find . i've banished all other decorating magazines my subscription list	1

i lean left politically looking magizine inform get me thinking . i tried several others , including nation , settled subscribed mother jones . while magazine leans left , it so more informed intellectually honest way , opposed rah rah banner waving way . it mixes bit more social commentary investigation opposed political propoganda endless articles how defeat republicans . if you're interested solid investigative , left leaning magazine , check out mother jones . check out their web site , they some free content additional content available if you get magazine	1
mother jones informing us trade agreements how we save our jobs usa . when unions try fight corporations order get health benefits their employees not take cuts their paychecks company threatens leave . saying : " like it or you won't any jobs all . " this isn't fair trade , it going " cheap labor " overseas . this magazine getting message out i love it . they exposing truth nafta cafta . we all need more information like this so we save economic future our country . if we not , we consumer , not earn enough pay items we buy . this means goods sit warehouses , company stock goes down stock market crashes like 1929 . we need fix it now . read this magazine .	1
excellent independent research ! investigative journalism its best . it neither liberal nor conservative publication , neither republicans nor democrats spared . politicians make lot claims , mother jones looks beyond their words see if they actually put them into action . you see when you read mother jones , many politicians ( both democrats republicans ) not " put their money where their mouth . " also , ignore reviews saying it biased . apparently , they consider facts inconvenient run counter their beliefs biased . what interesting if they came across article mother jones supported their beliefs , they agreed , then they would probably say article impartial fair . hey , truth hurts sometimes . finally , reviewers claiming this liberal magazine because it talks bush so often misguided . mother jones so many articles bush because he makes so many claims says so many things not supported his actions . he easy target . they articles kerry others too .	1
one my favorite magazines one deserves wider reading . i love breadth coverage ... history , current culture ( though pretty much limited american culture ) , politics , philosophy , science , film , music , theology , course , books ! reviews gotten me read quite few books i otherwise would not found . i also read first things not agree its coverage or authorship broader , but any case don't limit yourself one or other -- take look both . you course access both through their web sites see what kinds articles included their issues .	1

i've getting this magazine through smithsonian several years , so delighted see i could get it cheaper through amazon .

it seems almost sacriligeous find fault tls which many kind book-review bible . but when compared other book- review venues including ny times bookreview ny review books , i find it somehow chauvinistically british narrowly focused . i also must admit not liking skimpy look journal . i base my remarks here not one reading one journal but my general feeling after going through many many different editions tls over many years . now i should qualify this saying there course many many outstanding reviews outstanding books , outstanding round- up surveys special feature reviews . however when it comes areas which i degree specialization , i usually find taste reviewer so wide mine i end reading unease dissatisfaction .	-1

foreign affairs makes no apology its antiquated typescript , large print , generally stodgy appearance . it hardly needs . it simply one consistently finest sources foreign policy discussion available american ( thus * foreign * policy means usa vis -�- vis world ) point view . design folks correctly discerned toying appearances could only interfere train rolls just fine it . fa often vehicle choice american foreign policy officers who moved think tanks other private sector roles . example , see richard holbrooke ( he dayton accords ) piece entitled ' liberalism foreign policy ' most recent ( july/august 2006 ) issue available this reviewer . voice most often heard fa decidely washington establishment , broadly defined . yet editors occasionally toss dissenting viewpoint like hugo ch�vez ' ambassador us (' benign revolution : defense hugo ch�vez ' , july/august 2006 ) color . writing well informed superbly edited . roundtable discussions issues concern common , themed issues . again recent issue , topic ' rise india ' provides space four essays entitled ' unshackling economy ' , ' india global strategy ' , ' america new partner ? ' , ' kashmir conundrum ' . fa genius lies globe foreign policy experts digested these contributions great care , yet business traveler her first trip india easily same first flight her journey . such quality fa editorial work . long-time readers often discern editorial drift right or left , perception may owe much changing currents international affairs constantly moving matrix which any statement must written read any real shift journal political leanings . foreign affairs must read career internationalists , worthwhile educational tool those who want know what america brightest ( thought not always most touch facts ground ) policy makers thinking , diversion hobbyists whose curiosity regularly yanks them tornado-like out kansas	1
years i taken this magazine , i noted often covered material becomes tomorrow news latest hot-spot world . so prescient , it eery - if you any interest current events , news or foreign affairs , this journal must read . contributors who who politics , science business world . often author list become under-secretary state list next administration . example , last issue discussed avian flu virus . physician , i tell you these excellent informative articles explained clearly what happening what danger . now this stuff tv every day i amaze my patients how much i know issue no one else . reading this definitely make you look smart . try this experiment see if i'm right . this article written october 2005 , days after receiving october issue multiple articles china written chinese authors . course means these articles aren't really useful facts so much they useful seeing what china wants us believe . i predict china much more news next 6 12 months . so put this magazine test see . one negative although authors bi-partisan regarding party , they not " conservative " . you won't ever find pro-tariff , anti illegal immigration , isolationist , anti judicial activism or pro-life articles here . indeed , regardless which party author supports , you pretty much count expanded government , especially one-world government presented solution . lastly , some articles deadly boring contain stilted , obfuscated , diplomatic jargon . you rarely find simple , eloquent phrase , but you often find ideas pop up any analysis news . just realize many these authors diplomats politicians whose careers depend obfuscation plausible deniability . all all , this extremely influential journal full cutting-edge ideas . just realize many them may wrong	-1
only magazine i read cover cover foreign affairs , published distinguished bi-partisan council foreign relations . ideas issues presented each issue discussed six months later news . recent example this phenomenon publication daniel yergin michael stoppard next prize , strategic issues surrounding future natural gas energy source . article appeared late 2003 , since then concerns raised article reverberated business publications , energy conferences sunday talk shows . since my childhood i thought foreign affairs influential publication leadership circles . over quarter century ago , i remember reading henry kissinger promoted daniel patrick moynihan us ambassador united nations basis article he wrote foreign affairs . founder company dedicated cultural business travel russia , i need stay ahead knowledge curve regards world , rather than just informed events . i find foreign affairs single most valuable tool stay informed foreign policy , trends world affairs , current political thought .	1

if you one whose definition rock music fairly elastic whose taste rock music eclectic , then i recommend mojo magazine you . i haven't read all magazines relating music course , but those i , mojo best job covering music scene today . its approach fresh its appeal wide . unlike some other music mags around , it one whole family read probably find something musically meaningful each . its writers , whose taste music broad , approach music without allowing personal prejudices color their articles . they find much merit new nick cave cd they new bert bacharach effort , if music worthwhile they it without gushing . recent issue highlighted bob dylan , marianne faithfull , sid vicious sex pistols each which certainly appeal different audiences . thing i like best mojo each issue comes cd featuring various artists doing whatever type music focus month lead article . cd really adds value me anticipating next one . i never thought i'd like sex pistols , but when i heard feature cd songs influenced them , i understood their music lot better . you might get better deal magazine than offered here if you go bookstore , find magazine , look insert bearing special offer . that what i . whatever way you decide try magazine up you , but i'd surprised if you didn't find it informative , enjoyable , money well spent	1

i've subscriptions just every woman magazine there over past 8 years , but only one i always renew " glamour " . it less " how-to-catch-a-man " oriented than " cosmo " , less pseudo-hipster than " jane " less serious than " marie claire " . while it certainly no " ms. " magazine , it lot women-positive messages every issue , articles aren't sensationalistic fear-mongering than most found women magazines , lots fashion beauty tips . i feel " glamour " strikes right balance frivolity seriousness -- those you who like side third-wave feminism your fashion , i highly recommend it .	1

i subscribed ws couple years late 90s , loved magazine . it keeps balance reviews wines both new ( which main emphasis ) older vintages , background stories vintners so . writers almost all very good ( i'm professional writer myself ) -- only one them i dislike he doesn't review wines . both wine connoisseur novice profit reading this publication . i only dropped subscription because i moved collection , no issue which i wished discard , occupying more more space my bookshelves . now i subscribe online edition so i check ratings before i buy wine . ws , addition parker other reviewers , perform essential service critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether bottle worth price asked . we need ws parker all tell us when best reds ready drink -- some really great ones not mature more than decade . i drank highly rated chateau canon 1982 , which i'd paid over $100 , 17 years after harvest , my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down . sure enough , if i read spectator carefully , i'd picked bottle occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature . robert parker reputation more influential high-end wines , but wine spectator scores generally pretty close his . they review broader spectrum , noted other commentators below . ws often steer you excellent buys under $15 , or even under $10 . if you get only one these per month , or steers you away very overpriced bottle , subscription ( $50 ) pays itself	1

... if it heterosexuals . playboy multidimensional lively magazine men . it addresses all areas male life including technology , work , hobbies , sports . yes , sex included , both word pictorial , but , clearly , playboy not smut . there nothing dirty it . nude women appear small number its pages contents , they far most innocently portrayed than you'll find just anywhere else internet . nowadays , culture bar set so low idea nude women , appearing alone frame , regarded pornography seems rather quaint . honestly , there no exploitation found any their exposes . girls immediate justification evolutionary psychology they mature but height physical fertility . they hypnotic view . articles , which admittedly clichd excuse reading playboy , , fact , extremely underrated . many them focused educational . only reason i don't give it five stars due fact i am not member democratic party , i feel playboy ideological agenda it expresses far too often . this past issue slanted interview democratic advisor article arthur schlesinger which highly biased . i really think this inappropriate because lifestyle magazine should not shove politics down one throat . furthermore , such ideological vantage point absurd given editors ' real enemies not " theocrats , " but male-hating bully boys political correctness . none these shrill social critics found right . they spread misandry perches media womyn studies programs terrorize our universities . publication like this , any engagement or importance , must recognize , battle , ridicule political correctness wherever it found .	-1

" article " broom one own " talks how much children love included , helping , doing something themselves . toys mentioned here things like mirrors , sand , water , great outdoors ( sense advertisements here seem really out place ) . i also deeply appreciate magazine attitude towards children learning . other magazines , there abundance advice how ensure you stimulating your children much possible , how manipulate their play exploration , how make everything into language game , everything into quiz , everything into kind lesson which adult charge show puts child through his paces . this magazine , least now , takes approach learning happens . allow it happen allow yourself enjoy around it . i love . i can't wait see third issue	1

even though there seem hundreds different digital photography magazines newsstand every month , digital photo pro pretty much only one i buy . i don't buy every issue , but seeing i end up buying 80% issues , i should probably get subscription ! i like digital photo pro because it actually contains new useful information . " new " because it information i haven't read magazine or web , " useful " because information targeted readers solid understanding basics digital photography . i find most other digital photography magazines targeted newbies , they take turns repeating same information ( like endless articles different ways convert colour image black white ) . many contributors digital photo pro well-known names digital imaging field , so information generally current practical , excellent photos illustrate articles . recommended	-1

i personally always enjoyed reading time magazine long before i became politically aware . i started reading this magazine since i my adolescence . i think it liberal biased some other reviewers claims it ? i don't know i don't care . i don't read it particular point view . some cover stories past may highly questionable given how shallow they might but i don't take it personally . one best articles i read long time issue high school drop outs . i thought quite thought provoking . i didn't think much 100 most influential people world list . katie couric ?! c'mon . woman hard journalism paris hilton music . i won't even get into rachel ray . if people think time magazine too liberal , then go read national review . i don't see time hard journalism . half stuff they publish fluff pieces .	-1

your grandfather told you , you can't always judge book its cover . nor , these days , title magazine always clue you into content begins page three . refreshing , then , page through issue car driver find -- still crazy after all these years--it * still * cars drivers . don't get me wrong ; usual suspects appear month after month columns dig into one aspect or auto industry . there those ubiquitous pages adds major auto producers after-market confectioners shiny things bolt onto them . but everything else cars people who drive them . slightly more accurate : cars , written people who drive them . fair number pages given over exotic performo varieties four-wheeled fast . but car driver displays no embarrassment majoring cars rest drive . or might drive or might choose never drive , given due attention reviews put into hands drivers like this reviewer drivers who drive living .

atlantic classic cultural , political literary voice america . first published team included legendary icons such ralph waldo emerson , oliver wendell holmes henry wadsworth longfellow , this periodical went include articles great historical figures such mark twain , woodrow wilson martin luther king jr. it may hard place current contributors next those specific individuals who came before them , but they stand tall contemparies published similar venues . this not magazine those who currently feel they well enough informed current crop " news-tainment " programs , talking heads mouthpieces found air waves today . here you'll find in-depth , critical analysis intelligent literature . you disagree some points view might you feel compelled label something it pages conservative or liberal ? maybe , but it understandable today climate . i would suggest you'd probably trying too hard , perhaps unconsciously , fit authors articles into particular partisan column . letters editor tend highlight differing points view so i encourage you read back following month see how others respond get feel magazine . i think most reasonable people tend find this magazine well worth time read regularly . recently there usually one full length article related issue middle east each month , which should expected current events , but content varies significantly within each issue you won't feel overwhelmed . there regular sections columns ranging travel book reviews fiction " post mortem " profiling some notable world figure who recently passed away . way comparison , harper new yorker probably closest style , though new yorker comes out weekly ( mostly ) instead monthly ( mostly ) like atlantic harper . if you're trying decide three , pick up each them two or three months see which you like best . i prefer atlantic overall , but if i time , i may pick up one or other if some particular topic it particularly interest me . bottom line , you could lot worse than subscribe atlantic	1

there not many magazines specializing political commentary really any good these days . so many them geared toward political party , instead concentrating issues most important . " reason " magazine exception , its motto " free mind implies free market " vice versa , it proven publication one count objective analysis under umbrella motto . authors who write it definitely their biases , but they attentive these biases , usually anticipate answer objections ideas which they expound . many times this reviewer heard authors editors reason " socially liberal " but " fiscally conservative . " this kind description almost implies their thinking mere hybrid liberalism conservatism . but this description incorrect , content articles reason consequence general belief among its authors editors freedom , means first freedom mind , moral universal , regardless place context which one finds oneself . `social liberalism ' reason , if one call it , manifests itself tolerance ideas one finds repugnant . `fiscal conservatism ' reason manifests itself belief freedom not subject arbitrary coercive government no qualms using deception or actual force collect taxes , impose censorship , or generally violate individual rights . there always many fine articles written reason diversity topics . advocacy biotechnology refreshing reflects common sense attitude very rare political debate this branch technology . one also find commentary government waste , propaganda , torture , " war " drugs . addition , many book reviews included books relevant issues magazine wants address . one only hope reason stays afloat delivers many more insights years come . magazine both barometer freedom thought well its creation .	1

after buying first issue rachael ray new magazine i knew i would subscribe after only few pages . those pages not only gorgeous glossy , but chock full fun facts , great shopping places food utensils , course tasty recipes you want make . i collected way too many cookbooks food magazines stand untouched because when it really boils down it , its all food some those books magazines not deliver end . i since bought some great cookbooks pay more attention what inside then what cover . rachael recipes not pretentious , they certainly interesting enough engage reader into trying them out . i've made several dishes lemon cream pasta , mushroom pizza , salmon pasta dishes , sangria frozen pops some great grilled food . rachel provides shopping lists standard pantry ingredients fresh produce buy , so its easy see what you all ready what few things i pick up my way home make fun meal . i love making her recipes adding them my repertoire , its nice knowing you make certain dish its even nicer whip up easy dinner or lunch using this magazine . i also adore fun articles you find restaurants , cheese diaries , wine tasting , outdoor grilling foods events . magazine really beauty read more information entertainment than advertising . i cant stand regular food magazine i used get half full cat litter advertising , page after page useless products screaming my face . i hope this magazine continue bloom because i absolutely adore it i intend keeping every issue instead tearing out recipes like i used . great buy something you cook out feeling mini cookbook but simpler prettier	1

if i pick just one women magazine subscribe , " good housekeeping " would one . it many same articles all women magazines : articles health , fitness , finance , relationships , diet , beauty , fashion . but " good housekeeping " goes beyond surface these articles , example , their fashion articles don't focus just high-priced clothing , instead they show outfits look like their expensive counterparts readers buy just fraction cost . there also advice columnists things like household hints , etiquette , relationships . each issue also short story . there also seemingly obligatory celebrity cover interview inside each issue . what i like " good housekeeping " in-depth articles . most magazines today publish articles only page or so long , but many articles " good housekeeping " several pages long . articles often ordinary people making difference world . there usually cautionary articles parents young children and/or teenagers frightening ( recent article sexually abusive male babysitter ) but very useful . many magazines , good housekeeping also on-line counterpart , where readers post messages current issues well enter contests . well worth subscribing .	1

i've subscriber many years . martha magazine always filled beautiful images great-looking recipes . her suggestions housekeeping , gardening , decorating always tasteful useful . i particularly like her holiday recipe selections . my main complaint her magazine recipes . food looks great , but recipes i've made fairly bland side overcomplicated . i immediately pass over recipes ingredients i cannot find supermarket or recipes which require 7-10 eggs endless beating . i come conclusion i prefer recipes which spicier than martha desserts which less frou frou . fact , i prefer her food magazine recipes . 4 stars . i'm lifetime subscriber , but i wish recipes little more my taste . they seem geared more toward goumand foodies than your average joe	-1

over fifty years hugh hefner beaten his critics very diverse magazine . beyond great pictures , playboy leader fighting rights we so often take granted . whether defending what consulting adults private , or how worship or not we please . mr. hefner there without extremes aclu . it also timely articles law , science , sports , arts entertainment . women playboy more sensual than maxim or fhm . who often just revolving flavor month girl . mr. hefners creation outclassed outlasted its competition reason . i deduct 1 star because , blonds { usually out bottle } overepresented than their actual % our population . mr. hefner , please bring more oriental mediteranean goddesses . like kelly hu vanessa marcil .	-1
... if it heterosexuals . playboy multidimensional lively magazine men . it addresses all areas male life including technology , work , hobbies , sports . yes , sex included , both word pictorial , but , clearly , playboy not smut . there nothing dirty it . nude women appear small number its pages contents , they far most innocently portrayed than you'll find just anywhere else internet . nowadays , culture bar set so low idea nude women , appearing alone frame , regarded pornography seems rather quaint . honestly , there no exploitation found any their exposes . girls immediate justification evolutionary psychology they mature but height physical fertility . they hypnotic view . articles , which admittedly clichd excuse reading playboy , , fact , extremely underrated . many them focused educational . only reason i don't give it five stars due fact i am not member democratic party , i feel playboy ideological agenda it expresses far too often . this past issue slanted interview democratic advisor article arthur schlesinger which highly biased . i really think this inappropriate because lifestyle magazine should not shove politics down one throat . furthermore , such ideological vantage point absurd given editors ' real enemies not " theocrats , " but male-hating bully boys political correctness . none these shrill social critics found right . they spread misandry perches media womyn studies programs terrorize our universities . publication like this , any engagement or importance , must recognize , battle , ridicule political correctness wherever it found .	-1

my husband i bought past 2 issues hobby farms , we really enjoy it ! it always articles organic methods gardening , interesting information animals you might not considered ( this month , dairy sheep ! ) , equipment use small farm , variety other useful bits information . similar magazines like og amp ; mother earth news , but more focused specific information quot ; back farmquot ; individuals lots more info animals instead just gardening . it fewer ads than most magazines , but ads still there ... but least they're grouped next articles similar topic	-1
this not solely magazine financial news . writers various points view give reader great depth research their reporting . precise coverage current events , science , law , medicine , economics , politics , technological news you not find anywhere else . i would say thrust magazine " libertarian light . " it simply best news source english speaking world	1
i'll agree everyone else say this magazine probably need new name . however , i love all other features magazine ! it cooking light , but there so much more - always article travel destination , article beauty , article sport , well other constants . theme magazine total healthy living , incorporating health issues exercise well healthy food , though i think it mostly food magazine . i gave it four stars because while recipies look good , some ingredients bit too sophisticated everyday too expensive .	-1

" fortune " classic newsstand , vital important today ever . " fortune " generally caters people managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis current events business world , global national economic climate , forward-looking technology trend information . each issue normally organized around theme or major story , like enron trial , or 100 best companies work given year . i enjoy articles where they rank things , but more than rankings themselves , i am always interested justifications they use their rankings ; while i don't always agree magazine , i always find it good food though t.t he features generally very polished accurate , lessons conveyed straightforward manner useful ceo college business student . i particularly appreciate interviews " fortune " key players financial industry , also appreciate very useful index companies individuals featured every issue . magazine probably not favorite investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want read more specific magazine like " kiplinger . " nonetheless , investment advice insight " fortune " offers should generally held high esteem . i also appreciate coverage key trends , particular want note " fortune " lead excellent reporting pension crisis america : coverage this sort what makes me loyal reader . many other financial magazines available competing your money ; while there several i would recommend , " fortune " remains reliable source information macro-level trends , should part everyone business library	1

self-diagnosed christianity today junkie , i cannot speak highly enough christianity today thoughtful comprehensive resource anyone interested christian faith . ct brainchild billy graham fifty years ago , it maintains his strain christian perspective , namely evangelicalism . graham never interested preacher answering every bit theological doctrinal minutiae , nor christianity today aim so . instead , this magazine truly covers full spectrum issues impact lives christians , news stories current events biographies leaders within church analyses important social spiritual matters controversial battles ( past present ) . ct offers genuinely global perspective christianity , telling missionary stories around world each issue . there stories successful thriving churches every stripe descriptions victories successes occur within all sorts denominations ecclesiastical organizations . they periodically include debates or discussions opposing sides important theological ideas , offering folks both sides forum state their case . one things i appreciate most christianity today their passion journalism right way christians . they publish articles writers whom many their readers not necessarily agree , they chronicle lives many folks who may outside church or least affiliated fringe movement . they all this while maintaining unabashedly clear evangelical center , which most clearly communicated through editorials each issue . i love heart this magazine its leadership . i love their approach their charge evangelical christian journalists . i truly read each issue , cover cover , including all advertisements even classified ads ! i feel like i remain well-educated informed christian when i immerse myself this amazing resource . i find myself copying or forwarding links least one or two articles each issue friends family whose lives i know touched mine always when i invest reading pages christianity today . i would recommend it anyone .	1
let me say straight up , this great magazine .. it one few magazines consistantly good . i subscriber seven years i say without reservations this one best magazines print . contributing writers like , christopher hitchens first rate , i admit hitchens aquired taste , but he always makes me think .. laugh everytime i read his essay , whether i agree or not . i also enjoy reading dominic dunne diary , he really great life , he knows everyone .. who anyone , granted he total gossip social butterfly , but he knows it , he joke so speak . i afraid quality magazine would suffer when singular tina brown left , but greydon carter continued her steller helmsmanship . i highly recommend this magazine , i really don't know soul who subscribed this magazine not loved it .. honest	1

i guess i still subscribe pictures . ;-) yes , there time when scientific american so difficult read understand i always felt like idiot , even when i award-winning physics major college ( yeah , hard believe ! ) . now it great way keep up cutting-edge scientific thought . i still don't entirely grasp latest string theories or loop quantum gravity , but i read those articles -- admittedly help graphics -- get idea implications theories , how they work or conflict other theories . most hard-core articles still written research scientists , but these authors become better writers , they learned audience like me : general population , wanting keep up latest cool stuff . there still purely scientific periodicals where they publish their equations use latest jargon . i'm thankful they " dumb it down " rest us . time when good science often dismissed general public favor " what bleep ... " other popularized pseudo-science , i am incredibly thankful scientific american still true scientific method .	1
i read scientific american occassionally back 80 . time i found articles ( especially physics articles , which i love ) especially dense poorly supported graphics . quality there but it didn't quite get across my younger self . now , i find text very good superbly well-supported side matter graphics . i would call this improvement ( both magazine , perhaps , myself ) . however , i didn't read it regularly back then , so perhaps negative reviewers correct saying magazine " dumbed down " . if so , then it very lofty level articles continue require reasonable background their subject areas . example , article " computing quantum knots " just right somebody who read number non-mathematical treatments this topic who , like me , read parts feynman lectures things nature . it sophisticated intelligent article . there many more examples i could give . my only gripe scientific american ( this true decades ) i just don't like medical articles magazine regulary them . this , however , personal matter reflects my interests not quality magazine . i strongly suspect " format changed " , some said , because publisher wanted improve it everybody catch few more readers . certainly , i would not subscribed old scientific american . it too dense too boring . now it just right me . but that me . your mileage may vary	1

i subscribing this book magazine over 2 years . during time , i exposed so many wonderful books authors i never would heard . not only magazine cover fiction novels , but it also covers other genres interests well . every issue they interview book club club shares what books they loved or not liked so much . they also " you read " section which interviews people their favorite books . so if you want increase your exposure books you otherwise may missed , this magazine perfect . it also enjoyable reading itself . their reviews also saved me reading books i really wouldn't like after all .	1

regular readers my reviews probably getting sick me mentioning kage baker , but i credit her getting me try lot things i wouldn't normally try if she hadn't part them . asimov science fiction magazine time where this case . while i bought fantasy science fiction magazine every month while now , i would also check asimov see if it baker story . if it , i would buy it . what i found , however , i enjoyed most other stories issues i bought well . thus , now i buying it every month too . much like fantasy science fiction , asimov contains mostly science fiction stories various lengths ( short story , novelette , novella ) couple columns some cartoons . difference two asimov contains no fantasy ( though some mike resnick stories fantasy feel them ) . however , magazine likes concentrate character-based science fiction , so you won't see lot " technology first , character second " stories magazine . personally , i think that good thing hard science fiction turns me off . if you're more into hard sciences , you may find stuff here interest you , but there good chance you won't . occasionally , there guest editorials ( they printed george r.r. martin guest honor speech worldcon october/november issue ) . there always " books " column , sometimes written paul di filippo , sometimes peter heck . authors use this column recommend books you may not come across . robert silverberg opens each issue " reflections " column cover everything space exploration ideas story-writing . james patrick kelly occasionally featured " net " column , examining various science fiction web sites other online activities . unlike fantasy science fiction , there often some poetry included well . finally , there calendar upcoming conventions covers world so you always find someplace go if you need get together group fans . bread butter magazine , though , stories . each story introduction editor ( currently gardner dozois , though change sheila williams january issue ) , which may explain genesis story , or just tell us how long it since author appeared asimov . one things asimov different it often serializes stories eventually appear book form . allen . steele coyote series serialized over last couple years all them collected two books ( coyote couple years ago , upcoming coyote rising ) . also , charles stross ' accelerando featured recent issues . one drawback this readers who only pick up occasional issue . instance , " survivor " october/november issue didn't really mean lot because i've missed everything came before it . it reward regular readers , though . asimov many writers who write almost exclusively magazine , or very least authors submit their stories this magazine first refusal . my favourite , kage baker , only seems appear here , only one story i know appearing realms fantasy . allen . steele . robert reed seems featured everywhere ( i swear guy churning them out like he machine ) but he featured lot asimov . magazine bound just like fantasy science fiction , however cover thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it tear bit easier . this advantage you sometimes leave it lying open reading ( though this only works if you're toward middle it ) . it also means it rolled up if necessary . only other fault i it , this strictly personal thing , stories don't always grab me much they fantasy science fiction . this mainly because i'm more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly wouldn't case everyone . while hit miss ratio varies issue issue , i say i never skipped story magazine . again , that benefit short fiction . you're not going waste lot time them . if i choose two magazines , i would definitely choose fantasy science fiction . however , asimov certainly good enough it easy make room both them . plus , picking them both up , i feel like i'm doing my part keeping short fiction alive . it only small part , but every little bit helps . david ro	1
i love elle magazine ! it better than vogue , my opinion , because vogue all too expensive clothes only rich people afford , too many damn pages it basically picture book more than anything . it filled nothing but advertisements pictures anorexic models . i get bored reading/looking it fast . elle other hand , articles informative more affordable designer clothes shown . beauty fashion featured , but so some great reading material .	1

i find interesting articles every issue i receive . i like fact articles offer wide range topics . example , you find articles relating diet , travel , relationships physiology . all issues provide yoga sequences you practice home . magazine offer advanced sequences more physically demanding simplier ones much less physically demanding . articles portray nicely sized color photos pose in-depth explanations how perform each pose . i am visual person who needs see more complex poses performed front me rather than described writing , so unfortunately , i can't take advantage some more difficult sequences . however , if practicing yoga some time familar enough wide range poses , or follow in-depth written instruction , you enjoy these sections . you may surprised volume advertisements found each issue . it doesn't bother me because there still remains plenty good reading each issue . you receive only 7 issues 12 month period . it would nice receive one every month . overall , entertaining informative magazine i recommend . yoga journal also fantasic website you explore free . website offers many interesting articles provides instruction information many common yoga poses .	-1

i would love subscribe olive , but i can't justify it . i understand subscription includes airmail , but still ! i buy single issues store near my home , even retail prices , 12 issues cost less than subscription . but , give you idea how good magazine this , every single month i deliberately make trek store buy copy . if you looking marketing description , olive would seem like real simple , or magazine its ilk , but somehow i find it more satisfying than those perfectly nice publications i never find anything makes me say , " let make this weekend . " i'm not sure how describe reasons why . olive could subtitled " food , wine , travel busy people , " because it emphasizes tasty meals without fuss . each issue section 5-10 dinners you get table 30 minutes ; plus " weekend cooking " section dishes you're willing fiddle ; plus section cooking what fresh market right now . ( issue i picked up today three recipes feature peas , instance . ) it ranges exotic thai curries fish chips . there also restaurant reviews travel ( more " travel foodies " -- they expend some energy telling you where eat ) . i cooked least one dish nearly every issue , every single one them winner . these aren't necessarily " company cooking , " though some recipes certainly qualify . however , their " fast food " section exactly what i want : real meal that feasible middle week . among my favorites chicken-mushroom-wine stew pastry . it really take half hour , start finish , part because it instructs you use store-bought puff pastry . man , it tasty . would enough ... but fun extra this british magazine , put out bbc . when they taste-tests tea or chocolate or ketchup , brands what available uk . although i recognize few brands , results aren't terribly useful ; but i think it hoot . ( what i say ? my idea cool thing vacation foreign country go grocery shopping . ) nor most restaurant reviews likely relevant ; but then , ny times restaurant review isn't going help me , either . i still enjoy it . i can't imagine you'll spend this kind money without seeing issue . if you've seen copy wondered if its quality holds up ... i assure you , it . only food magazine i think equal quality u.s. fine cooking , it different angle	1

" that great if you're west coast , since you'll get some california hikes if you live there , some washington hikes if you live there . but midwest stretches michigan texas . here indiana , i'd rather get appalachian trails ( or southern trails alabama mississippi ) than trails texas or oklahoma . could we " great lakes " region , maybe ? also , magazine heavily dependent equipment advertising that obvious editorial content . magazine philosophy unreconstructed gearhead who loves spending money stuff . i know that how magazine business works , but i don't like i t.t hose complaints aside , it best backpacking magazine out there , well worth price subscription	-1

this quarterly magazine really hits spot , if you're its crosshairs . it clean miss others . it pretty easy tell whether you're target audience . you closet full decommisioned pcs , cell phones , other 21st-century rubble you just know you could " something " ? you dremel tool , fine-tipped soldering iron , more than one kind epoxy house ? phrases " it works " " it beautiful " mean roughly same thing you ? idea home cnc milling machine stir you jealousy or quick look your checkbook ? two or more yes answers probably qualify you intended reader . this hacking your pc mouse or cage your pet mouse , resurrecting last year laptop electronic photo frame , how simple robot control ( you'd surprised ) . it like popular mechanics , but people who consider software , resistors , pieces antique clocks interchangeable . although few ideas each issue low-tech appeal , most aimed skill sets " geeky highschooler " " electronics professional " . this magazine comes o'reilly , publisher who fills bookshelves dilbertian cube farms everywhere . some ways , this looks like self-concious attempt community-building , creating forum home robot-builders artisans silicon age . well , maybe that not bad thing - communities out there , but not easy beginner find or break into . it also helps minimal advertising ( part reason hefty cover price ) well targeted electronic gadgeteering hobbyist . title only up issue number 6 this writing , so i'm not sure it wholly found itself yet . example , i would preferred schematic some circuits addition assembly instructions . still , scriptwriter macgyver , there lot like here - right reader . //wiredweir	-1

i discovered uk magazine , blackhair my local library . i devoured latest three issues . black woman , blackhair beauty magazine i've longing . each issue divided into three sections -- beauty , fashion , hair . there plenty stories how care all types black complexioins skin , well hair weaves braids relaxers natural styles . most united states black hair magazines seem forget natural styles or attach story seems tacked end . blackhair also offers glossary chemicals ingredients featured most beauty hair products . this gives women chance figure out if they're using right products based their needs . there also plenty advice columns answers readers ' questions . i really love fact they use real-looking models dark-skinned models norm , not afterthought . if subscription wasn't $74 us , i would certainly plunk down money one . i love blackhair magazine i hope my library keeps carrying it	1
friend mine told me " fast company " year ago , i subscriber avid reader since then . magazine enigmatic , combining news magazine , cultural commentary , business reporting , entrepreneurial insights into one publication . many issues deserve five star rating , but occasionally cohesion editorial focus bit uneven . thing i most like " fast company " 21st century approach news analysis : it thought provoking , explores all sides complex issues , but never tries tell reader what think . perfect example this april , 2006 issue article " al jazeera ( global ) mission , " which former us marine now working english-language version al jazeera profiled extremely multi-faceted story . entrepreneurial bent magazine great younger managers small business professionals , reporting market trends second none . although there times i don't agree articles or editorials " fast company , " i always find them intellectually stimulating thought provoking . i recommend this magazine independent thinkers everywhere	-1

elle decor ( usa ) doesn't appeal me since i started reading british version , elle decoration ( uk ) . elle decor ( usa ) reads like showroom catalog filled spaces average american never live , nor could one ever reproduce even small scale their own homes since most magazine 50% design 50% architecture me - meaning often design room would look silly like complete rubbish , but it bones room - soaring ceilings , towering columns , sweeping staircase , make rooms appealing . unfortunately , very few us own homes like , so when we try apply same ' look ' our own spaces , we fall flat . elle decoration ( uk ) , other hand , takes much more creative approach design , although shot beautiful rooms , they often not feature all architectural details massive spaces elle decor ( usa ) features , so you apply designs your tiny nyc apartment come up look works your space . their designs not so stiff formal , they not take design , nor themselves , too seriously . elle decor ( usa ) seems flaunt overindulgence over-the-top , where everything must follow specific guidelines there no room jump outside lines every now then . elle decoration ( uk ) jumps out lines constantly , showing us good design isn't taking things so seriously home lacks warmth personalization . it may seem though i'm bashing elle decor ( usa ) , i'm not , i read it well . it offers informative articles beautiful homes , eye candy we all dream . but elle decoration ( uk ) blows idea perfect living dream home out water approachable design one could duplicate their own home - whether it urban apartment heart queens , or architectural masterpiece midwest . this magazine appeals all , making it one my top 5 magazines out there	1

if you're here u.s. , don't let put you off reading this fantastic magazine just because you won't see lot american cars . this magazine worth every cent ( more later ) . reading miriad great cars , cheap thrills supercars , you can't get here bring tears your eyes . renault making giant killer little chevy aveo-sized hatchback 197 horsepower 18-inch wheels ? yes , it happens over there . it simply so much more than you see any u.s. car mag . it big , both physically content , written kind thorough evaluation engrossing , you'd-swear-you-were-right-there-with-them prose above any other ( including car , my pervious favorite ) . what makes it so good ? three main things . first , writers , course , many them springing former performance car magazine . sad publication declined just every way over it lifetime until , time it demise , it wasn't worth bother anymore . oh , how they've redeamed themselves ! second , cars they write . focus performance ; but not just super-exotics , thank god , tuner cars ( although latter pop up now then entirely appropriate way ) , but anything stirs driver soul , even if it $ 10,000 little hatch zingy engine giddy handling . third , writing . evo much more biased toward subjective evaluation favor just spouting instrument test numbers ( hello u.s. car magazines pages pages minute often uninteresting stats ) , their data panels concise just enough information thorough without bunch fluff ( brake swept area ? come , road track , who cares ? ) . best example far their annual car year issue . yes , everyone these , but no one it like evo . it much more free-form , much more subjective , much , much more fun read . rather than evaluate each car distinct portion , it reads more like road adventure drivers swapping cars really letting you know how each drive . frankly , you get impression evo doesn't give squat if one car pulls . 89g skidpad while competitor pulls . 87g . what you're much more likely read how each car * feels * when grip used , used limit . hard numbers matter less than true driving fun , which why you might find handling little hatchback rated above wide tired monster . they provide plenty performance data , but big difference they don't get caught up it . you'll find it more important how car handles than how it grips , how effective it brakes over long , hard drive rather than how many feet it takes single stop , how car works or against you provide real fun . all engaging writing wit . i'll stop babbling now . :o ) but i want conclude one item mentioned almost every review here - price . it cheaper buy good bookstore . there some convenience peace mind subscription , but i'm baffled why british car mags always more expensive subscribe than buy off shelf . evo still worth it , though	1
jethro bovingdon . richard meaden . harry metcalfe . who these men ? it ever important , even plausible reader would desire not only know names , but get know automobile journalist ? these exceptional men not just magazine editors ( although harry , now jethro , hold title ) , but guys out there trenches putting rubber pavement , driving some world best vehicles 9/10ths telling you absolute truth their performance , handling , day day livability . motortrend so called " car year " ? fuggedabouit ! evo " car year " actually requires someone driven car before handing it award . driven it hard . i started reading evo little over 3 years ago . honest , time initial appeal larger form factor ( larger than any u.s. car magazine ) breathtaking full-page photography . however , it only took short while realize i holding my hand gold-standard automotive journalism . road track reviews each issue , hard-hitting interviews newsmakers , designers industry leaders responsible direction automotive performance , unique british sensibility pleasure seeing $ 500,000 supercar struggle classic b-road , put them together you best english-language car magazine published world today . i remember one time expressing female friend how evo posseses not only incredible technical acumen -- some most accurate road tests business -- but nearly every issue embodies some finest prose put page _any_ monthly journal . it just so happend months issue there particularly moving passage harry metcalfe group ferrari road tested . beauty mr. metcalfe evocative language could bring tear any car lover's--even grown man's--eye . such automotive passion , it any wonder sir harry went own 512tr himself ? how many auto journalist live ( pay ! ) exotic cars they test so readily praise ? every month this magazine covers creme performance oriented automobiles , many which only available europe or uk . renault megane pagani zonda , evo give accurate , thorough review it performance both track real world driving conditions . due their location europe , their extensive connections throughout car world , evo often travels australia or even africa see some best sedans , coupes , convertibles exotics their native or not so native environment . how rolls royce fair under harsh conditions turkish roads ? find out evo ! you could buy evo just pretty pictures there lot them . you could read it articles some would wont . combined , its superior prose gorgeous photos , there no higher recommendation car enthusiasts than evo magazine .	1
this magazine really good , because it supportive women girls . there no models this magazine , lot people say it sexist , but my opinion , when model magazine tell you yourself , isn't kind hypocritish ? besides , if you want look models or read celebrity you always read other magazines . i like new moon because it talks real problems world , not just boyfriend . this magazine also celebrates inner beauty . it doesn't talk make-up much but doesn't mean new moon against it !	1
first all , i really used like new moon . i'm rather growing out it now , but i still take peek copies i find once awhile . i love what this magazine commits -- their focus women rights environment . i love it teaches body image not only thing , women strong people too , we all this earth together -- it our job preserve it future generations . liberal leaning this magazine also appeals me . however , i think it little anxious talk puberty--that what books , not magazines . going reading feature girl africa reading periods -- well , that just little too much me . it really breaks up flow magazine . also , i didn't enjoy this magazine much after i thirteen , then i wanted cicada instead . all all , however , this magazine definetly worth getting kids . i still like most parts it , it some great teachings	-1

when you're big baseball fan course you always listen mystique surrounding sporting news its history . they " bible baseball " until 1980s , when they decided stop covering minor leagues decrease their mlb coverage . but recently they started pick up . i got subscription i say they really gotten their act together . not only great competitor sports illustrated ( which dumbed down last few years ) , but it surpasses it . it covers sports without bells whistles . you get superior reporting interesting articles , not long stories personalities seem written their team pr department .

sports car international , far , best automotive magazine currently made . this magazine road track , car driver , motortrend , automobile , all others wish they could . this magazine little more pricy it only comes 6 times year , but not diminish its excellence . this magazine far fewer subscribers than big names , but doesn't stop it consistently most beautiful photographs , best writing , least ads . while big names endless pages advertising , sci few . also , this magazine one most focused ones rack . you won't find honda civics , cadillac escalades , or any other crappy vehicles . magazine reviews more than sports cars alone , but they excellent job limiting coverage quot ; sportyquot ; cars . variety also overwhelming . if you subscribe motortrend , you might get 3 or 4 sporty cars one issue . very first issue i bought reviews bmw coupe , ferrari 360 spider , ferrari 365 gtb/4 daytona , aston-martin vanquish , aston-martin db4 , porsche carrera 4 , others . motorsports coverage features relating automobile industry also second none . if you love exotic sporty vehicles , there no other magazine get	1

i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1

" experts ( including naturopath , gynecologist dietitian ) answer this question excellent responses . - " medicine cabinet : attack weekend warrior " natural remedies aids those like myself who love weekend warriors . - " clothes pose " great yoga gear ! - " medical breakthroughs " - " healing supplements : 8 ways beat anxiety " - " fitness fix - knee savers " longer articles include : - " healthy appetites : savvy strategies eating well " delicious , healthy recipes tips . - " good medicine : clean , healthy mouth " well-researched article " mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste best at-home remedies " . - " five paths peace " five simple meditation techniques . - " eat beat heat : yin foods " more great recipes ! - " sacred spaces " - making your home your personal retrea t.t his only sampling ; fact , that less than half magazine alone . some articles fairly short , but provide just right amount information get point across . my personal favorite last page , " make one change " , where this month change " upgrade your z " . it included simple tips i able implement immediately . amount advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably same amount you'd find yoga journal , but not nearly many oprah magazine ) , they seemed line natural health focus . judging past reviews natural health , it seems magazine bad run 2003-2004 timeframe . let remember magazines change editors frequently . i found none past complaints true this issue , but may not so future issues years now . me , i want subscription asap	1

" other popularized pseudo-science , i am incredibly thankful scientific american still true scientific method .	1

fine cooking takes somewhat consumer reports-like approach cooking , much manner cook illustrated . but there several key differences set fc apart make it superior ci : 1 . fc , not all voices sound alike . ci , every article , no matter who writes it , sounds though it written same person . i understand why they this ( keeping focus food not personality , maintaining consistency ) , but it gives magazine creepy , musty , claustrophic , stepford wives-like quality . this magnified fact there no " outsiders " allowed into ci kitchen -- no visiting experts , no star chefs , just ci staff their identical voices . 2 . fc there no christopher kimball essays : ci bow-tied editor fills up entire page already thin magazine folksy , prairie home companion-like homily why owning large , upscale farm rural new england makes him morally superior everyone else , replete recurring cast curmudgeonly cranks crackpots -- all which absolutely nothing any food issue , or lives anyone else planet , possible exception martha stewart . it embarrassing , self-indulgent soapbox . but he leader cult , so don't expect his sermons dispappear any time soon . 3 . ci advertises itself " ad-free " -- then proceeds glut its pages print ads blow-in cards touting ci cottage industry recycled books . i'd rather peruse offerings fc advertisers , whose products least potentially useful me . 4 . fc no constantly recycled material . such supposedly modest operation , ci puts out staggering number books , many them single-topic tomes borrow heavily recipes already printed magazine , well other , previously published ci books ( there evil twin " america test kitchen " series books dvds ) . you're likely find same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe 16 different books . incestuous nature this recipe factory casts unflattering mercenary shadow across ci mission . 5 . fc offers superior quality production methods . glossy paper attractive , full-color photos fc put ci faux-downhome matte paper hand-drawn illustrations shame . 6 . fc much more variety . fc also its own group regular contributors , but they supplemented each issue experts variety fields culinary arts ( who write their own unique voice -- imagine ! ) , giving magazine broader scope much fresher feel than ci , which tends stick standard set all-american classics , which they recycle every five years ( how many times you revamp " secrets macaroni cheese " ? ) . give fine cooking look . it hands-down best food magazine home cooks	1

" wired consistently behind curve these days , but doesn't stop publication spinning every article like golden truth you too lame know . articles controversial subjects , one side routinely saddled straw man arguments so blatant artless i find them offensive even when i disagree parties who set up fall . just often , features which don't discuss contentious topic still edge them , making fun person , group , or idea way isn't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted subject matter . generally , wired mean-spirited it self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily demographic tech wonks it industry tourists professionally personally deflated bubble burst , desperately trying assert their relevance relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content easily outweighed sheer volume half-truths , shoddy reasoning , straight-up falsehoods which could easily revealed corrected casual investigation subjects treated pages choked high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . isn't world technology interesting magical enough without mixing spin , double-talk , factual misrepresentation presidential debate impotent , absurd bravado battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough how tech rules world how it , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize technology promise educate its current future potential . instead it concentrates one-shots written style passes " hip " forwards attitude rather than message , emphasis sensationalism over accuracy , more common advertising than edification	-1

i subscribed this magazine almost year now i become very skeptical much its advice . this advice seems heavily influenced its paying advertisers e.g. us dairy industry ( there always least one those annoying " got milk " ads ) not surprisingly , every issue there several articles magazine hype supposed benefits diet high dairy products ( e.g. milk cheese ) . however read many books nutrition , it become very clear me majority current research shows diet high dairy products actually very damaging your health - instance read china study colin campbell , extremely comprehensive nutritional study sheds great deal light us dairy industry its shady methods influencing public perception healthfulness its products . it well known there many better ways getting calcium etc into your diet than dairy but this magazine unfortunately blinded its advertisers ' paychecks . magazine also appears very similar prevention magazine which i also subscribed i would make same criticism . my advice stick reliable sources health like excellent " berkeley wellness letter " not supported or influenced advertisements drugs companies or powerful industry groups like us dairy industry	-1

i under impression this literary magazine would full fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , literary criticism . instead i received magazine discusses political issues . magazine know what it wants ? they recently released special fiction issue newsstands . why would they if they're becoming political magazine ? they want news/political magazines such time , u.s. news world report , newsweek or they want literary magazine ? they're doing poor job establishing themselves drawing line what they want . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . course atlantic staff , turning magazine into political direction probably bring them more sales . i don't think reading literary magazines dead any means but format needs revamped so people want read it .	-1

obviously " ugly " comments below written uneducated uneducated guesses assumptions . i love this magazine . there awesome workouts , great meals great stories inspire one all . yes , it cover fitness/figure competitions , but it doesn't mean everyone look like or get their bodies level ... it magazine inspiration ... look physcially fit ( who only able look like when they compete , not 365 days year everyone knows unhealthy ... even those who compete ) . yes , downfall this magazine all supplement advertisements ... but what magazine without advertisements ? every magazine you look some form adverstisements since this technically " bible " fitness , there going advertisements tailored supplements . i admit , i somewhat offended reading what " ugly " say . they must've jealous , because i felt way towards fitness like they when i their shoes ( i weighed 180 one point my 4 ' 11 " frame ) , or upset because they didn't research this magazine just assumed it would girly magazine false info how lose those last 20 lbs doing useless no weights exercises or " seen tv " cardio dvds/exercise machines/gimmicks . those women not ugly all not bodybuilders ... most fitness competitors doing gymnastic type routines only lifting tone . weight lifting not body builder make . you would lift extreme , power lift pros take steroids ( hence ugly men-looking women ) . so ... if you want take your body next level ... better yet , actually lose some fat healthy manner need some inspiration , please buy copy this magazine . check it out . if you're into fitness/figure competitions , well , obviously this bible . :) uneducated below , i am competing my first figure competition 9 days . all things i learned through my trainers , most supplements you see ads not condoned them . contrary popular belief , we don't all consume protein shakes all day , nor this magazine say you reach your weight loss goals . substituting toast jam bagel cream cheese just bad , because you're substituting sugar fat . doesn't make any sense . i am one who overweight learned great deal magazines like this ... every magazine , whether it fitness , fashion , etc . must taken grain salt every now then , because not even so-called " experts ' agree what works what doesn't . everyone body different . look this magazine , research , make educated choice	-1

this might sound strange first , but i confess : course i subscribe gramophone its critically perceptive unfailingly well-written reviews features , but perhaps what i love best this magazine copious informative record-label advertisements ! just leafing through nov . or dec . 2004 edition , i see full-page even two-page spreads showing : * all lastest issues gramophone awards series -- series mid-priced reissues universal ( philips , decca , dg ) recordings won gramophone award . * all latest issues rosette collection , series mid-priced reissues universal recordings awarded rosette penguin guide . * all latest releases hyperion , dg , sony , rca , philips , emi , virgin , naxos , naive , classics pleasure , bis , chandos , cpo , mdg , etc . etc . etc . other words , if you're fairly assiduous collector trying stay abreast all latest recordings , you find gramophone invaluable indeed unsurpassed this respect -- both new releases reissues . ads not only give you catalog numbers release dates ; they also inform you which recordings won which awards garnered accolades which critics . browsing ads gramophone every month * * best way see all new releases -- not even most well-stocked classical-specialist cd shop would carry all these titles . what more , many many desirable classical cds * never * issued domestically north america , so how else you going find out what available europe ? furthermore , every issue contains 4- or 5-page section called " new releases , " which lists very specific product info every cd issued month over 100 record labels (!!) -- that no exaggeration because i actually counted them . new developments i've noticed since gramophone significant makeover nov 2004 issue : gone robert layton ( bbc music magazine ) , apparently traded jeremy nicholas ( bbc music magazine ) -- these new developments , aren't they ? so it no longer true say all three penguin editors write gramophone : layton gone , now only greenfield march . ( i take this opportunity say i still miss baroque critic nonpareil nicholas anderson . his moving gramophone bbc music magazine reason i started reading mag first place . ) finally , way rebutting previous reviews this page : you see above list record labels advertise gramophone , it no longer true ( if indeed it ever ) magazine kowtows " major " labels . fact , gramophone critics recommend many or more recordings such " indie " labels naive , harmonia mundi , hyperion , chandos , mdg , cpo , capriccio , glossa , linn , avie , lso live , telarc , etc . etc . they " major " labels : sony , rca , warner , universal . it certainly * not * true next quality recording more likely emerge mp3 file russia than new release " major " record company -- reason this simple : record labels -- all them , including indies -- today greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts . until likes vengerov , perahia , manze , biondi , minkowski , harnoncourt , jacobs , hundred others free agents making their own recordings , record labels remain relevant -- nay , indispensable -- ever . you won't find vpo , bpo , lahti so , or concertgebouw popping up obscure mp3 file either ! therefore , gramophone " business model " -- earning revenue record-label advertising -- hardly obsolete . quite contrary , moreover gramophone quick embrace " indie " labels such harmonia mundi ( mag " label year " last year ) ventures such lso sfo issuing their own in-house recordings . fact , reviewer below who predicts imminent demise gramophone ( extension all classical mags , including fanfare , diapason , bbc music magazine ) sounds much like gramophone-resenters classicstoday.com, who making same claims quite some time . such resenters their ilk apparently never learned this simple lesson : you cannot build yourself up simply tearing others down . ( attention classicstoday.com: want earn some critical clout ? then learn write , crying out loud ... take hurwitz , example , who routinely exclaims : " this best recording or , period . " period ? this supposed enlighten persuade me ? but pardon me , i rant digress . ) finally , even if we assume sake argument gramophone fanfare offer reader equal amount equally well-written reviews -- i'm really not convinced this true -- but assuming this so , i give nod gramophone all above reasons . fanfare doesn't offer superabundance information copious amount new releases reissues , therefore isn't useful tool staying current * all * new releases . i must admit -- call me superficial if you , but i must admit fanfare lack production values makes it relatively unappealing . fact , based its appearance feel , it reminds me slightly larger-sized version reader digest . i freely admit i love tactile visual qualities gramophone -- large glossy pages photos graphics ads all make very pleasurable perusal . contrast , fanfare seem like underground newsletter . i believe more than one critical perspective good thing , while i would certainly not discourage anyone subscribing fanfare , i still think gramophone obvious first choice	1

it true entrepreneur mag loaded ads -- but those ads interesting themselves . i always find it fascinating see what ads pop what ads junk -- it easy see difference . this opportunity develop your own advertising strategy ! content , there certainly room improvement . i personally enjoy entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they longer . i would like see more meat here . business several years now , i find most value this magazine comes front section where they list interesting tips , new products , survey results . not month goes i don't bookmark page so i follow up new product or check out website mentioned short piece . alone , low subscription price worth investmen t.t here lot information franchising , which great those interested this business model . though this not my personal cup tea , i still find it interesting read lists franchises notice trends popularity . who knew there so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one best general magazines available entrepreneurs . not every topic appeal every reader since we all run different kinds businesses seek different information . if you're looking something more specific your industry , trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you keep eye climate small biz world .	-1

i subscribed this magazine one year ago . out four issues i've received this year , i've knitted least one project idea each issue , three so far fall issue alone (!) each turned out beautifully . i haven't read any other knitting magazines appeal me consistently this one . i've noticed each issue careful balance projects , appealing both genders all levels knitting expertise . each issue contains few " gee-whiz ! " type articles front interesting , exotic sometimes downright weird news knitting world ( like , who knew knitting could considered performance art ? ) . there usually exotic " catch-the-eye " or cutting-edge fashion project , followed other apparel projects always beautiful , visually appealing frequently wearable , too ! although magazine occasionally include items make me shake my head disbelief , interweave knits generally seems select projects real humans wear without looking like freaks . you'll also find couple ideas non-apparel and/or " quick gift " -type projects each issue , ranging felted backpacks novelty purses baby hats . now , if all this sounds good , just wait : it gets better . real clincher me patterns seem tested carefully proof-read before going press . i've worked 7 projects iwk this year , yet catch single mistake pattern directions ! maybe i've just lucky so far , but i noticed iwk website list errata amazingly short ... so either they don't update errata onto their website , or they really don't allow lot mistakes slip through . short , i think " interweave knits " provides lot bang your subscription bucks . two thumbs up me	1
