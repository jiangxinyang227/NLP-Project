this shirt too tapered body sleeves feels very confining . people who like it must quite thin , indeed . it not wrinkle because high percentage polyester but it doesn't breathe very well , either . i am giving it 2 stars only because all color choices , though why someone would want dress shirt some available colors beyond me . price , you better , even someplace like target	1

this nice looking wallet , but internal design leaves something desired . there internal flap used credit cards , etc , makes wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it cards . i am tempted cut it out ( it stitched inside ) make wallet less cumbersome . credit card slots also too tight - so you pry cards out - run risk cracking or splitting cards . there nice display your license - small hole cut it so you push license out your thumb when needed ( it also tight slot )	1

:( these give you pain . i bought these shoes because they looked rather cute picture , considering they weren't just $5 pair shoes , i thought they would somewhat comfortable , if not doable , wear . buyer beware : these shoes cut your heels . they run little small , so i suggest getting least half size larger . if you want anything besides sitting looking pretty , not buy these shoes . i walked less than 2 minutes before they started tearing blistering my heels . they also little tight toes , so if you wide foot , these definitely not you . i admit , they darling cute , but they not worth pain .	-1

sling support feature these underwear practically useless . my testicles always slip completely out sling before i've them even hour . if these briefs enhance man " profile " all , it because they're so darn tight ; it nothing sling support . talk " low-rise " -- top my crack exposed even when they're pulled all way up . i'm pretty good shape , but if these things shrink dryer , i won't able fit into them anymore . my advice : anybody ordering c-in� briefs should go one size larger than what he'd normally wear	1

i astonished how flimsy poncho turned out . i mean , almost $25 invested included shipping , i expecting better quality . well , it very thin , made china , plastic snaps . so-called polyester lining just adds heat that generated . i've owned many ponchos through years , first thing you learn poncho terrible design keep out elements more than short period . reason involves way it cut . what i've learned you should buy something some weight fabric so wind doesn't lift it up or out allow elements inside . next , you become hot start sweating profusely short time . so , good lining , or breathable system required . if you're just going use it short bursts rain , then you get cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere . however , if you camp lot , or out elements , you need better . best poncho i ever owned rubberized outer layer thin cotton liner . this solves both problems i mentioned , because it weight stay down lining help evaporate sweat	1

friend suggested these shoes waltzing around neighborhood . i never forget day . first thing you must know these shoes they horribly uncomfortable first . stiff plastic boards attached your feet , you wander around wondering why you'd ever wasted your money . soon , however , they start mold your feet . they take every bone , every curve , every nitch . next thing you know , it like wearing glove . perfect shoes seemed made just you . they age , they eventually start smell , you replace them repeat whole process . i love these shoes . however , they not love me . after years wearing them , lack arch support finally me ... i developed foot problems rendered walking impossible few days . pain lasted months . time , care , my feet better . but i can't go back these amazing shoes . my suggestion wear them sparingly .	1

my wife shopped around amazon looking her grandmother 88th b-day ( coming up soon ) came across handmade hadong silk scarf . every silk scarf she came across she would say , " what beautiful gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they . " before she found vietmade silk scarfs amazon , she looked online stores macy , nordstorm , jcpennies , but couldn't really compare ones vietmade made . i agree my wife when she said , " this place uses good quality silk materials great prices !! " when we got scarf today 4/10/07 ( ordered 4/4/07 ) opened it see what silk scarf looked like person .. my wife wished she ordered one herself , one my mother one more our sister in-law . my wife i definately recommend this place we'll buy few more hadong silk scarfs near future . also , delivery schedule , good packaging love scarfs !	1

recently , i took motorcycle trip atlanta , ga ft . lauderdale , fl . unfortunately , i didn't option riding night when it cooler my thermometer bike showing 100 110 , it felt like riding through oven hair dryer set high blowing my face . i also didn't luxury air conditioning so simulate this so i would pour water my t-shirt let wind cool it down . after getting home , i recalled seeing demonstration cooling vest you soaked water couple minutes then wore under jacket , preferrably mesh . i amazed how well it worked demo so i went online ordered one . particular model i ordered amazon deluxe evaporative cooling vest black . it came week after i ordered it via usps priority mail . they offer several styles colors , including some removable sleevesthe outer shell quilted black nylon 2 outside , zippered pockets zipper up front . neck velcro closure so it fit snuggly around your neck if you want . inner liner blue 100% nylon taslan , water repellant fabric , so it keeps you getting all wet wearing it . out package , it weighs just few ounces but when you put it water , special material , called polymer embedded fabric ( pef ) , inner outer shells absorbs water vest ends up weighing 2-3 lbs . you only need soak it minute . there spandex panels either side allow some expansion . i got large size it fits great , not too tight , not too loose . once water absorbed , instructions ( tag vest ) say you wring it out or use towel blot inner liner dry . not like sponge , wringing it doesn't lot good so i'd suggest blotting if you need . while inner liner water repellant , there might some water it right after you soak it so putting it might get you little wet but if you don't soak it too long , inner liner relatively dry . material holds water doesn't expand like sponge , it just holds lots water ... it pretty interesting stuff . first thing you'll notice after few seconds it cool touch . principle it relies cooling properties water it evaporates it really works . i haven't chance ride it sweltering heat yet , but putting it under my mesh jacket riding without windshield kept me nice cool . i don't think i'd like try it anything less than 65 deg ( ) because i'd probably freeze nor would i want use it under leather jacket unless there some way jacket let wind flow through it . inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get little damp . cooling effect last several hours depending how long you soak it if you want put things front pockets , they lined same material inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry . one thing i've found though , it'll take several days completely dry out unless you ride it . water very slow evaporate but once it , weight goes back down few ounces . bottom line , i highly recommend getting one these if you routinely ride hot weather . they're inexpensive way keep cool they're stylish ( except hi-vis lime green ) . wear it under mesh jacket you won't know it hot outside .	1

i've tried 6 different nursing bras . this one , center snap closure , easiest use . it also lightest most comfortable , while providing good support . my only complaint after 50 washes underwire begins poke free fabric . even when i try sew it back into place , it breaks loose after few washes . perhaps if i handwashed bra instead using machine , it would last longer . this bra less durabe than my other nursing bras ( particularly leading lady bra , which seems indestructible ) , but it well worth sacrifice comfort , lightness , ease use . it far my favorite	1

i hate long socks smelly shoes so i've become big fan shoe liners . i recently ordered set these am very happy them . they each individually priced $5.99 . so 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail . so this good deal $4/pair . more importantly , they heavy-weight cotton no underside seam . they elastic all around opening actually stay your feet . they cut generously -- my feet size 8 they little big , but manageable . if you smaller feet i'd try get different size than m/l . they ride bit higher foot than some others -- they fine loafers , but lower cut shoe could problematic . i've tried lot these socks : calvin klein , ralph lauren , donna karan , peds , leggs , et al . these far best .	1
my online shoe shopping tip : buy half size bigger than your normal size . if it little too big , you always add inserts achieve betterfit . i also search web additional consumer reviews . pros : this pointy toed boot looks really sexy - great bargain 30 bucks!it easy put short boot . ( it goes up bottom my calf - i'm 5'5)the leather shiney seamless look . stains wipe right off . i'd recommend these nice pair jeans or even youngprofessionals wear their slacks . relatively comfortable . i personally wouldn't wear them all day long . cons : leather stiff . doesn't really bend leg when walking . i think what previous negative review referring . inside shoe nicer softer leather . zipper not best quality . hope this helps you make better shopping decision ! * or , you always buy , try return . if you choose free shipping method you want return item , you just go returns section website andgenerate return label . once amazon receives it processes it , they give you your refund minus shipping cost you savedwhen selecting " free shipping " . ( it usually less than 5 bucks you see amount " your account)enjoy	1
i love my cayman crocs . my sister swore these shoes , but i wasn't convinced because they little different looking . i liked bright colors i saw some people wearing beach this summer , but i'm practical they only go so many things . i ended up purchasing navy pair because they go just anything . i'm not all disappointed . they really don't look bad paired casual outfits . i wish they could make soles all shoes out this stuff though because it amazing . it not so much you slip them say " wow this feels great " ... me it more so after activities ( marathon shopping trips example ) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would them ready quit . i think they great ... even " different " look ... though i wish they'd come up more stylish pair some point	1

these probably one my favorite articles clothing . i am frequent ( normally 5+ times week ) endurance runner , i found these great addition my gym bag . whenever it too chilly wear shorts , i'll pull my underarmour coldgear leggings throw my shorts top them . thay keep my legs nice warm without overheating them . i also tend use these base layer under everything jeans my dress pants whenever it cold out . again , they keep my legs warm , but not too warm . i also like fit these leggings . they tight around legs , providing good muscle support compression ( good reducing injuries soreness ) , without too uncomfortable crotch rear ( provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes , they supposed worn underwear ) . they also what feels like synthetic microsuede interior , which just ads overall comfort level . i heard few people complain underarmour heat gear keeps them bit too cold , especially when they don't wear anything top . i like slightly cooler when running , so these work me . if you can't stand bit cool side , you probably shouldn't leave any part tights uncovered ( wear something over completely covers them ) , but if you don't , yo won't shivering either	1

this shirt looks like i , ve made it myself . very simple printing quality shirt not so nice either	-1
i using hanes brand boxers years i swear them . material light not cling thighs . basic design seams running up cheeks bottom not up centre . this prevents boxer clinging centre behind . boxers durable remain wearable many years . note front flap stay open after continuous use should pressed retain `closed ' look . color selection somewhat minimal . 3-pack usually 2 one color when there should 3 different colors/patterns . why buy : your `main ' line boxers - practical everyday use . you want see your man looking sexy even after many washes	1
i am extremely happy my jeans they fit great ! price fantastic seller one best	1
this hat really wasn't quite what i'd expected ... i thought i purchasing winter-y sort knit hat , it turns out front fabric hat actually quite thin , back hat trucker cap type mesh material . i didn't even notice it picture all , they seemed angle hat photo so you don't see mesh back . anyway , it still cute hat , i'm just not sure it worth money i'd paid it after discovering what it really like	1
there very few options small figures ( 32a ) , what available generally doesn't fit me well . this minimally constructed design works very comfortable . when i find something works difficult find i buy multiples because my experience , manufacturers eventually discontinue it ( much my disappointment outrage )	1

i just started doing water aerobics needed shoe traction while pool . unfortunately , i need wear sandals medical reasons apparently no one ( including columbia ) makes water aerobics sandal . i tried these because they sounded like they could handle exposure water really good price . they handle water just fine , drying completely 8 hours show no sign falling apart . traction isn't strong i would like , but it better than bare feet or damaged toes shoes . also , sandals create more drag water than regular water aerobics shoes , making my feet cramp more than they probably would . i gave product five stars because sandals performing way they advertised ; i'm just using them something they weren't designed	1

trip beach , just down street , or warm outing , these sandals serve their purpose . first foremost , soles massage feet every step . sensation quite soothing especially when first breaking them . even after these sandals longer than year they still cushion feet very well . addidas brand outer design blast wear show off . it funny , but true i actually receive attention pertaining pair sandals . this pair best both worlds	1
my wife loves this kind earmuff ( over top head ) . she doesn't like ones wrap around back your head/neck - she finds those squeeze her head aren't comfortable after long periods time ( fall off ) . this model her favorite she wears them every ( winter ) day . this her second pair 6-7 years - they seem long life . very durable , fold up nicely put your pocket . yet easy open put your head . she known wear them hours time finds them very comfortable . they stay your head even when running/jogging , also light weight , wind proof , warm	1
i very disappointed when i opened package gemavenue . here why : 1 . ear muffs very low quality . hardly worth $14.99 gemavenue ( e4hats ) charged me it . $0.99 would fair deal . 2 . ear muffs advertised new but it definite " second hand " feel it . it reminded me opened merchandise salvation army store !!! no joke . fact there no tags it all inform me where it made , what it made , washing instructions , etc . it not even name manufacturer !!!! 3 . plastic band felt very fragile like it would break slightest pressure . adjusting width nerve-racking because i very careful not break it ! 4 . " wool " (?) very synthetic feel it . furthermore it sparse flat .... not warm fuzzy . i doubt very much it sheepskin claimed gemavenue . besides , there no tag indicate it wasnt fact some sort cheap polyester . 5 . i tried it it not cover my ears completely , so you sure its not going keep my ears warm all . conclusion , this product not new , not soft , not warm , not genuine sheepskin !!! what more i say ? i am just disgusted gem avenue ( e4hats ) selling me this rip off useless piece junk !!! i never buy anything gem avenue ( e4hats ) ever again !!	-1
i've wanting these since last summer ... price seller ! comfortable light-weight ... crocs great	1

" wool nylon blend ? " it impossible responsible consumer if you not know what you buying . my poor review based this . my opinion technology yet replace abilities natural materials like wool silk . course , this only my opinion preference . however , when manufactures refuse inform buyer more than " wool nylon blend ? " there no mechanism consumer make informed choice or even purchase what they looking . stretch nylon certainly nice form fit ease when it comes slipping your foot onto your sock into your boot . but - if too much nylon present it show its downside should hiker or hunter find themselves wet situation hiking long periods . it would seem age 100% wool sock almost gone i accept my fate , but i urge people not buy sock , which not disclose details its manufacture . review reflects " full disclosure advertising " not product itself . should amazon find it inappropriate then deletion understandable .	-1
such cute comfortable shoe , feels like sneaker , but dresses up any outfit	1

this compact traveling case . compact doesn't mean tiny . it probably one smaller name-brand standard size ones i've seen ( kenneth cole , perry ellis , swiss army , nautica , etc ) , but it not different size category . just different shape , slightly less deep , yet nice solid broad base ( bottom solid material which doesn't collapse ) . it definitely big enough average man toiletries . i like it . it also doesn't lot inside pockets . there just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't its own zipper . not mesh . i'm not sure what it big enough - floss lip balm ? rest inside open free . it water-proof lining wire flaps open compartment wide ( essential toiletries bag really ) . well-crafted what i tell . outside very handsome patterned leather . it looks aged without looking worn . it also smells leather out box - so much nicer than faux-leather travel kits . you won't mind your clothes rub against it your luggage . i slight quibble handle - it not easy grab most kits . it more loop than handle . so those cons : not lot compartments inside , not huge . pros : leather , opens very wide , looks good , durable	1

i bought my first ear grip home improvement store . i work outdoors everyday really need keep all exposed areas covered . ear grip works great ! not only it adjustable any size head but it worn around back head so it isnt noticeable other options . since it worn around back head/neck it also keeps your neck warm too . compared other ear muffs i seen ear grip wont make you look like fairy . there no fluff/wild colors/fur here you still able hear out them . they made plastic loop covered fabric . loop corresponds your ear so hole lines up your ear fabric thats covering it more than enough keep you warm . you also take them off flash compact them push turn so they fit any pocket . i highly reccomend them	1

this dress extremely sexy . i use different shoes belts it change look . it very attractive good vibe when you're wearing it .	1
i've wearing these shoes years . they're comfortable shoes get , they available eee widths half sizes , so they fit me well . their soles synthetic , not leather ; this may make them less elegant , but it also least quintuples how long they last . soles heels never wear out me ; eventually leather uppers get too scuffed keep wearing them except around house yard . except tiny little " buckle " strap , they no metal them , which means they go through all airport metal detectors without setting them off . soles thin , so i never made take them off airport security either . well , not until latest pointless revision tsa rules . someday sense may return airports , then lack metal helpful again	1
you get away wearing it office , but sole doesn't quite look like formal dress attire . they're super soft walk . but , all padding makes them uncomfortably hot except cold weather . i would think this niche product , but florsheim seems portray them extremely popular product	1

this good case made nice materials . it offers nice fit buttons easily usable . it comes clear screen protector belt clip so you carry it more comfortably . it just little bulky , but nothing worry if you plan carry it your belt , hand bag or hands . it could only fit big pockets , though . my only serious gripe inner seams , they very rough could scratch surface your player . yes , zen vision:m very soft coating this could leave marks . anyways , you really should consider getting skin your zen ( best skins ever ) any case . this very good case overall	1
i great deal research choosing case my new ipod . i decided iskin , i quite satisfied my decision . i remember , however , bit confused just how this case worked . so , clarify future buyers , case comprised : -first , thin , transparent silicone ( rubber ) sleeve . sleeve covers most front back , including slightly thinner cover where wheeel would placed . this ensures wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also protected . skin not , however , cover screen , portion back also exposed attach optional belt clip . this sleeve also come various colors , but i used clear one highlight natural color my ipod . -second , hard , clear plastic front plate snapped front ipod once it placed silicone . this hard case cover screen , all front ipod , except hole touch wheel . once attached , hard cover firmly held place . put together , this case provides exceptional protection . silicone very thin , yet protects against ordinary dings scratches . hard plastic protects front impact , screen scratches . best part me , even both silicone hard cover , ipod nano still retains its very thin size - case not bulky least . conclusion , i highly recommend this case anyone who purchases ipod nano . protect your investment	1
this great buy . i iskin my 30gb ipod i loved it . so when i bought my mom ipod nano christmas , i chose iskin nano protect her product . plastic protection nano iskin different than regular iskin , it clips over rubberized skin rather than under it , but design carries it off perfectly . one small complaint instructions removing belt clip - they didn't adequately explain removal , leaving me worried i'd break clip , but some small effort , i got it . great products great price . i researched all kinds protection ipods these best	1

i recently purchased small ameribag healthy back bag anticipation long summer trek through europe . i didn't think my backpack would secure pickpocketers , i wanted something little more " grown up . " here some reasons i am very happy this purchase : 1 ) comfort . my healthy back bag more comfortable than either backpack or large purse . its wide strap sets securely my shoulder without hand it , it adjusts easily so i carry it across my chest . you put lot it not feel weight - you not end up your shoulder knots end day . 2 ) security . zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit ; there interior zipper pockets well , so it pretty hard imagine someone hand slipping into bag without my knowing it . wide strap reinforced so it would hard cut . 3 ) convenience . this bag supremely well-designed features . outside , there flat zipper pocket ( good your subway pass ) separate velcro pocket one side , velcro pocket flap other , small pocket suitable ( say ) sunglass end . main zipped compartment wide variety open pockets ( perhaps pen , camera , pda or ipod ) , including one conveniently placed sidways so you easily get it when it still your shoulder . one perfect cellphone . there flat inside zipper pocket serves me well wallet . 4 ) capacity . i've got small version bag , it still hold wide variety daily essentials : wallet , phone , camera , ipod , paperback , compact umbrella , even perhaps very light sweater . biggest problem these bags figuring out which one you want - err small side ( they more comfortable ) , then choose whatever fabric color suits your fancy . you even get them premium leather , but my microfibre one seems easy clean good value . this my favorite bag - i easily see several decades my future healthy back bag under my arm .	1

i used this clothesline all over europe south america multiple trips , i love it . no clothespins needed , because you attach your clothes inside braid rubber . it packs up into almost nothing weighs almost nothing . you take one end clothesline , wrap it around something , such pipe or bedpost , or even doorknob , loop it through itself . you then take other end clothesline , small hook ( you get one separately ) , hook it itself . this hold lot weight - i've two pairs wet jeans 2 pairs wet shirts , socks , underwear all line same time . sure , it'll sag , but it no problem . don't get any clotheslines suction cups end - what if all you around wood concrete ? then there'll nothing suction cups . you can't really hang your clothes dry bathtub when you share bathroom other people ..	1

very useful thing travel . suction cups absolutely worthless -- would fall soon anything placed line sometimes even if nothing placed line -- , but since you wrap line around something hook it itself , that not too much problem unless you can't find anything else cord loop around . two twisting strands very helpful -- no clips required . only challenge i ran into finding places hook cords onto -- i get bit creative curtain rods window bars , it won't stretch across entire room -- but expected . overall , i highly recommend .	1

slightly padded molded cups this bra wonderful prevent nipples showing through - even if you're cold , if you get my drift . buxom woman ( 36ddd ) , i'm cursed " wandering " nipples , bra lines showing through shirts sweaters , bossoms " swing low " other embarrassing problems . this bra relatively comfortable generally speaking , it very comfortable compared minimizers other " hold'em up hold'em place " bras . personally , i think svelt look bra gorgeous . big chest , i've never able wear those lacy little bras victoria secret , so this actually big improvement over what my husband refers " industrial strength " bras like our grandmothers wear . i only give it four stars because underwire not comfortable if you sit long periods time desk like i ; it begins " dig " bit right beneath rib cage . overall , it great bra ( 1 ) hide nipples , ( 2 ) provide your breasts wonderfully rounded shape , ( 3 ) hides bra lines ( great t-shirt bra ) , ( 4 ) show off your cleavage but not bra itself ( if you wear low cut blouse ) . i think you'll like it ; remember , you tend get what you pay these days . days $18 bras far behind us	1

i own 2 these shirts ; price , they're great . they're perfect length me , hitting just hip . material thin stretchy enought they're easily layered camisoles , long-sleeved shirts , etc ., but it not so thin one must wear layer . they're really easy wear seem decent quality	1
this wonderful robe ; i agree everything mentioned other reviews ( except feather leakage ... not problem i noticed . ) however : i bought small ; it fit perfectly until i washed it ( gentle cycle , cold water , tumble dried low ) it shrank up too short length sleeves too tight across shoulders . i love it so much i am going buy medium give small away . i don't dry cleaning , i wear robe enough so it needs washing more than twice year (!) . so choose your size carefully if you plan machine wash it .	1
i surprised how fast item came . it high quality canvas , very sturdy made excellent present . i recommend this item anyone hunting quick bag work , shore , shopping , etc	1
i got this present my sweetie he loves them . it great bargain real shearling moccasins :	1
these silk pajamas , my opinion , much higher quality stitching , tailoring details , well heavier weight silk than closely priced dreamsacks pajamas . sizing help : help clarify sizing people ( there conflicting reviews here ) , i ordered medium but then returned it . i probably get some minor alterations , but i don't blame company ... everyone shaped differently . i am 6'0 " weigh 175 . my suit measurements 42 " chest , 34 " sleeves , 32 " pants inseam . medium body fit but sleeves pants too short . large best fit overall , although roomier around chest than i would prefer . but if you my size large your best option .	1
all men silk pjs i purchased over years my husband this one best . fabric nice heavy weight it it survives machine washing well . after reading other customers ' reviews , i purchased medium size person who usually wears size occasionally . it turned out too small . i would recommend going one size up	1

i bought this robe silk pajamas my boyfriend valentine day , both size large . pajamas fit nicely , but robe way too big ! i printed out return label listing reason return product not fit description online . amazon said this not their fault deducted cost shipping my refund , not offer opportunity exchange . so , now i re-order robe smaller size , price gone up $7 since valentine day . this would good deal if it run true size , but because misrepresentations made i end up paying close full price listed . moral : order one size smaller than you think you need .	1
i thought wearing silk robe more affectation than anything else . happily , i wrong . this robe well-made , comfortable , it really looks nice .	1

yup , they're pretty much regular aviator . they fit my face after little tweaking ( which no easy feat ) . one pair come cracked lens , but i emailed company hope hear response soon . good deal too !!	1
decent lightweight jacket anytime , not sure if it just my jacekt , but one my sleeves seems sewed slightly skewed so i twist it around get my arm go . could send it back , but not worth trouble	1
what would you expect levi strauss ? these comfortable 5-pocket jeans wear like iron . they not fancy jeans , but i live them weekend	1
levi strauss signature fairly new line jeans developed levi strauss especially discount store channel , mainly target , wal-mart , kmart . fit regular levi strauss signature similar if not identical fit zipper fly 505 , levi strauss most popular model blue jeans . main difference there less sewing detail rear pockets side just below waist , no red tab rear pocket . finishes mainstream stonewash light , medium dark . if you live this limited choice finishes you save few bucks buying levi strauss signature jeans . however , they offer no advantage over levi strauss red tabs other than lower price .	1

leather not premium ( should not this price ) , but wallet hold great number cards pretty compact size package . if you like me - carry tons cards hate thickness other wallets , also like see all cards without pulling them out then this way go . only drawback - business cards not fit plastic inserts , so only place you them leather pocket inside part cover . if you carry lot business cards wont work you . but me it not big deal long i 3 them they not getting dirty . overall i'm satisfied definitely recommend this product	1

this good , functional scarf . material typical polar fleece . it soft , but not exceptionally so . it very warm , but you breathe through it if you use it cover your face . it made acrylic polyester , it machine washable . one complaint i might edges finished stitching feels rough touch . also , i would liked seen few more inches length . but it certainly long enough use . overall , this scarf nothing get excited , full retail price seems bit high , but if you get it sale , you won't regret it . it what you need scarf	1

like other jocks this line bike , swimmer style total winner ! made high-quality materials , it height performance fit . smaller waistband allows greater movement less restrictive fit especially if you're doing any kind cardio exercise like running , biking or eliptical machine . contoured pouch made blended fabric allows maximum moisture absorption breatheability , while cupping supporting you . leg straps comfortable width don't roll or cut under your cheeks . my only complaint i wish they would come out black version like they their standard jock . get rid your old jock buy bunch these - i ! course look around , jocks here amazon seem bit pricy , this $6.95 jock i found local sporting goods store $3.99 , or 2-pack $7.50	1

i am larger guy needed light windbreaker-type jacket hood would also keep rain off my head ( that seattle ya ) . since none local stores these stock i searched amazon found this one . jacket excellent quality better than i expected it . it breaks wind extremely well , if you really need bundle up there velcro strips sleeve openings , draw strings around waist snaps go over zipper . all all this excellent wind breaker jacket . it won't keep you warm very cold weather , but it one best light jackets i've ever owned . when i placed my order november 16 , 2006 i chose ' standard shipping ' promised shipping date nov . 20 nov . 27 . i received item nov . 27 . i can't say sure whether i would received it sooner thanksgiving day not fallen within week , so i won't really complain receiving date . my complaint order , however , this : time i placed my order time i received jacket , advertised sale price dropped 25 percent , $10.00 . i ordered jacket paid $39.95 but time i got it , price $29.99 . this didn't seem right me . i've written turfer resolution but not yet received one . if this resolved favorably , i'll edit this review . except price dispute , i highly recommend this jacket if you need light windbreaker type jacket . it serve you very well . just make sure you get right price !! edit : still no response turfer price change , but amazon stated policy prices availability may change without notice , so i guess it buyer beware . i notice today price this item still $29.99 . i've using it 2 months now i must say it fantastic lightweight jacket . i want buy one but i'm afraid second i order it price drop $19.99 !!!	1

design this shoes make my feet look good , it hugs them right places ( my feet bit wide ) . they look fun too ( i got blue ones ) . they feel comfortable enough walk couple hours ( they light cushioning , they somehow stable ) , but becareful during those hot days because you get blisters your feet since they not leather . size , i'm 7.5 sandals 8 boots . these shoes i get 8 so they fit my wide feet , they just fine . they make me look really tall , yet more comfortable than other high heel shoes . i like . it true after while walking them your feet hurt front .

well , what i say ? this package serves its purpose , but $9.95 you can't really expect alot else . skin cover great , keeps zen vision safe , no question , but everything else low quality . screen protector almost impossible apply properly , arm band would great if view stand wasn't permanently attatched , therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it . i haven't used belt clip yet , but it doesn't look out ordinary , so i'm sure its fine . if you looking primarily skin cover , yourself favor just buy pick up brand accessories	1
well , after using my creative zen naked , no covering all ; other popular leather cover ; this sillicon cover/package , i honestly say , considering price what included this package , this , far , best route go when picking case your own zen . other main case , leather one , looks nice , but around $30 , i expect little more functionality . this cover few dollars cheaper , , i would only expect cover , included leather one . but , when you take into account screen protector that included ( which costs $15 itself other places ) , stand back ( which , granted , mildly weak , but look what it holding up .... if you watch your share videos movies your zen , i , back-stand comes very handy ) , other things , i would expect it more . so , don't let cheap price deter you getting this one , it almost me , thinking it poor quality . sillicon tends attract dust lint , but it wipes or blows away easily , , really , only thing comes close downside . get this case . you won't regret it	1

i bought this robe silk pajamas my boyfriend valentine day , both size large . pajamas fit nicely , but robe way too big ! i printed out return label listing reason return product not fit description online . amazon said this not their fault deducted cost shipping my refund , not offer opportunity exchange . so , now i re-order robe smaller size , price gone up $7 since valentine day . this would good deal if it run true size , but because misrepresentations made i end up paying close full price listed . moral : order one size smaller than you think you need .	1

i'm very happy this purchase . great hiking many extra pockets carrying ' stuff ' beyond water	1
we purchased couple these during $10 off $40 purchase pleasantly surprised quality . frequently , it hard judge whether particular brand clothing run small or larger , but know up front these run larger end . shirts very thick some warmest sweatshirts we ever come across - you won't keep these long warm house . only minor complaint we could express they bit stiffer than others , but likely due weave why they so warming . cuffs not quite snug we would like , but it better than tight . overall , price quality , these can't beat	1
i big thighs , so i can't wear boxer briefs or regular full-cut briefs because they always ride up . your jewels always seem get smashed your legs if you don't walk just right you keep adjusting yourself all day , right ? these hip briefs , however , cut up much higher so they can't ride up your thighs or hips ( not high bikini briefs , though , so you relax ) , waistband sits or just below your hips . make things even better , they're cut perfectly-shaped " pouch " front keeps your goods out harm way . i couple other brands " pouch " briefs , but this one shape got it just right ! i couple different styles calvin klein hip briefs , they're all basically same cut ( which important part ) . only thing really differs his various underwear lines fabrics involved : " body " cotton some stretch ; " xt " breathable spandexy stuff stay dry while exercising or dancing ; " pro mesh " really mesh made me feel awkwardly like stripper ; " pro stretch " sort like body fabric but more lycra	1
i got them 1/2 size bigger they fit perfect . these boots sexiest thing ever they really comfortable . quality also superb . you don't run across find like these very often . honey color more beautiful person . what more i say .... apepazza cutest most comfortable boots ever . i can't wait get different style	1

sizing review spot-on . i wear size 6 street shoe , my treadmill/track shoes ( adidas supernova classics ) 7.5 - kumasis i wear 6.5 . first pair i won mudddy buddy race , i loved them so much i got second pair - one really muddy , wet days other dusty , drier ones . recommended them my mom cousin , too , they love them . all 3 us high arches narrow heels . my mom aaa width , i'm narrow heel . all happy . big props adidas	1
i delighted find out keds still makes sneakers i bought kid . i just wore out last pair i -- i purchased extras least twenty years ago , so haven't look new till now . well , almost same sneaker ... these don't seem made same last old models ; they aren't quite good fit , but still pretty comfortable , sole still flexible light weight . inside lined terry-like material -- improvement , i think , if it holds up wear . colored stripe around outside bottom gone . i'm sorry , it gave them more streamlined appearance . but unless these new champions don't wear well , i definitely look more when i wear out these two pairs decade now	1

i not taken this vacation yet , but compared other fanny packs , this one seems very durable . i wish it little more room , but i think nicely . only drawback i alter waist strap because it too big ( i am size 8 ) even when i it small it would go . i like all different sections pockets keep items separate	1
this my fourth fanny pack . it seems better made than most . particular , belt buckle seems higher quality than most , that point failure two my previous packs . ( i wish i could find one metal buckle . ) there two changes i would make this design . first , side pockets too small because they join main part pack single seam . front panel side pocket needs join main front panel pack second seam maybe 3/8 " farther forward . this would make side pockets much larger more useful . besides , i note there only single seam joining belt pack . time tell , but i suspect this may become failure point . second or even third row stitching here would make me feel more confident . all said , it seems like very good pack -- zippers pulls high quality , pockets all lined , there plenty pockets including two security pockets money other small valuables -- i would give it 4 1/2 stars if i could -- just not 5 : -	1
this versatile boot(s ) works casual office best weekends . great deal ( price wise : $29.79 ) too ! there smooth , leather upper stays put stretch zipper ( fabric around zipper , but rest smooth , soft leather ) . although fits true size it reads " 8 � , " first it felt bit narrow ( especially around ankle ) but it became loose after i wear it . advanced cushioning , padded insole comfort flexible sole . over all , very comfortable classy !	1

after shopping local venues not finding quite what i wanted my boyfriends birthday i turned internet , i'm glad i . this just what i wanted ; good quality messenger style bag neither too young nor too old almost 30 male . he loves it carries his laptop daily . my only concern shoulder strap thinner than i would prefered , but so far it holding up job just fine . there several pockets inside so it hold quite bit , phone pocket side he chooses use his ipod !	1
i'm very happy impressed . my last briefcase stolen ( everything it ) , so i decided make best it treat myself bag i actually liked . looked some very pricey options local stores couldn't find anything style i looking . took risk bought this over internet ( significantly less $ than others i considering ) i am extremely happy it . case , even when full not bulky , but stores surprising amount . there open slots hold both my notebook my organizer , zippered section my files , two flat zippered sections miscelanious papers , two 1/2 size pockets holding my camera newspaper perfectly , slots business cards pen organizer . quality great , thick leather , nice stitching . my only minor complaint latches magnetic . i prefer physical catch type they little easier latch without looking . i actually took some brown shoe polish it right away give it more aged patina love it . i also cut off stupid cell-phone holder because i thought it ugly , bulky , i would never use it even if my phone fit . overall i'm extremely happy both david king bag luggagepoint service . i would gladly buy them again	1

given fact i not able ever find comfortable bra also supported my size chest ( my picky posture displeasure underwire ) , this bra won battle . there just couple quirks , but could just me . when i tighten straps , they eventually give way losen up bit . i find myself adjusting them every 3-4 wears . i'm considering sewing straps permanently adjustment . i hand wash it cold water mild soap hang dry . sometimes tumble low heat or air tumble shape size stay consistent . i lost just hair weight my breats bra fitted little loser . because this , vertical " waves " cup material appeared , but because there wasn't enough fill bra . once i gained size back ( unfortunately ! ) filled cup fully , ridges disappeared . i've this one 10 months wear it every day , it still great shape ! when this one finally gives , i'm definitely spending money buy one	1

... samsonite sling ( rose wine)looks great constructed well all great features , reason 4 stars(ipod holder , hole earphones , cell holder , holder school disks or cd-roms , pen pencil holder keyring ) . i wish you could give half stars . ( 4 1/2 stars ! ) ... very sturdy extra padding comfort . but warned , my daughters larger text books dont fit , nor her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio . top corner sticks out two three inches zipper unable fully close , so she carry them her hands ; which kind defeats purpose carrying handsfree bag . spiral notebooks mead composition books(black white ) fit perfectly . ... gripe she probably 100 pounds soaking wet , so strap isn't flush her body . shes tall slim 13 1/2 year old . it fit chubbies bustier girls whole lot better . velcor strip short , so there isn't much more ability adjust make it tighter .... samsonite either make strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten amount velcro they use so theres more ability adjust fit . we thought during colder months it might fit little better her winter coats , but it still hits her too low her body . we'd rather it more snug fit . she still loves it though , because color it holds all her stuff well ... cell phone , ipod , keys , bus pass , pens etc . minus 1/2 star size fit . overall great bag , 4 1/2 stars	1

like all 2(x)ist underwear i own , this brief made superior materials appears built last . it certainly well worth price i paid . if you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply not want flash your waistband any reason , then this brief you . period . those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or like , then you not need this , but you still very well may want it . clearly this brief meant two things ( 1 ) make it so you wear very low-rise pants ( 2 ) make it so you look irresistable when you not wearing your low-rise pants . i found even though underwear cotton - opposed synthetics x-factor line , example , this brief still conforms my body contours pretty well . actually very well everywhere except it bunches little where it meets very inside my thigh . regardless , this going show off everything you got , subsequently make it look ( more-or-less ) more impressive . practical consideration : pouch area above reduced size since it accomodating very low-rise . translation : cautious when you get aroused there not great deal " expansion room " . enough said , but why i gave this pair 4/5 stars . everything else great . i never problem my rear exposed these briefs . if you forsee this problem you , then may i suggest 2(x)ist contrast countour pouch brief 3103c ? it same price ( review time ) same materials but standard cut features sexy contrast lines . i own it well you may read my review it its product page	1

this far , worst product you could ever purchase your very expensive mp3 player . i purchased this item after trying out one silcone skins ripped apart after 3 months use . i use my mp3 player when i go running so i need armband product withstand elements my running . after using this product only 3 times , it began fall apart follows : 1 . protective screen cover nothing but flimsly piece plastic glued case . it basically falls apart when you try squeeze your vision into case . 2 . there these oddly placed velcro dots armband used secure it after you wrap it around your arm . huge design flaw dots needs line up top one order secure . so , if you arm odd sign you end up make it tighter order align dots . if you're market tourniquet , then you should buy this product . 3 . if you sweat least drop while you exercise or run ( if you don't then you're not really exercising ) , velcro dots lose their stick-um . i discovered fuzzy part velcro glued onto armband . it heats up your body temperature rising , it literally melts causes dots fall off . it because this my mp3 player almost flew off my arm onto cement . so , if you looking shatter your mp3 player , then buy this nifty product . i think my son ( age 4 ) could've designed better arm band holder his pre-school class .	-1

absolutely best ( excetp thick waistband but that small shortcomeing .	1
i completely agree review cary babka " bookworm-in-chief " . these best shoes i've ever worn before . period . i worn my pair several years . i wore them daily while walking everywhere i went europe . then i wore them daily while walking miles day advertising business . these shoes never let me down . only thing i replace shoelaces - one time . i never felt out place wearing these shoes . never i feel i too formal these shoes , nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners . my so called " casual " sneakers got demoted strictly playing tennis after i bought these shoes . comfort , my feet probably spoiled because these shoes . even if i work 16 hour days my feet still fine . much i've worn these shoes worked 80 hour weeks them , shoes still don't odor them other than well worn leather ( it barely discernable ) . i've never applied anything shoes , save shoe polish . i'm buy my second pair now because my first pair i've worn out after owning them almost 5 years . top shoes fine , only minor abrasions visible if i don't polish shoes once while . it soles wearing out , i've worn them down almost nothing . i very lucky discover bostonian i believe i'll never hunt comfortable shoes again also look great	1
this suit put together very well ... since great-grandson daddy marine .. lol great-grandpa navy man . thanks . love it	1
first all , size chart way off . i ordered size 9(men's)/10(women ) my husband , who wears size 9 , but he could not even put them . i tried slippers myself ( i wear women size 9 ) , even though there still some space probably half size length-wise , they way too narrow even me . both upper sole material very tough , unflexible " comfy " cardboard . i could not walk these slippers , only drag or slide my feet . inside wasn't soft my ll bean sheepskin slippers . top i pay return this item amazon ( there no " not fit " return reason )	-1
i love shoes . aerosoles makes great product . i not like white stitching down front shoes but it easy fix black shoe polish . i enjoyed shoes so much i bought second pair	1
i ordered this product twice both times i very satisfied how quickly it processed shipped , well product itself	1
this case works fairly well . since it semi-rigid case , it helps keep your gear pressed too much when thrown bag or backpack . i wish there bit more padding inside corner didn't press buttons much , but that not too big deal . you fit two 3-game slim cases top pouch still close case . three too snug . there no place charger , so you'll carry elsewhere . all around , well-made case reasonable price	1
these comfortable , durable , attactive shoes good price . just right office . i'm glad i made right choice	1
i ordered waterproof windbreaker , they sent zip front hooded sweat shirt . i needed item trip where i anticipated lot rain i didn't time reorder . i returned wrong item went what i which wasn't right thing either but , it better than what they sent . i'm not happy	-1
it came right time , i searching wallets on-line when i decided check out amazon.com . well my amazement , there exactly what i looking , zippered wallet snap-closure change pocket inside . wallet great , putting little mink oil it , effort soften leather . it would nice , if it more card slots , but overall i am very satisfied . gotten lot positive coments my wallet , like added little security zipper closure . anyway thanks again , think i all i needed check ( amazon.com)first , locate those hard find items	1

even though i no issue seller ( they shipeed really quickly ) i'll tell you definitely don't waste your money this garbage . i bought pair trip tahoe recently , before i even made it first run zipper split . got it back together , held rest day . second day , i hadn't even made it up first ski lift zipper broke again , permanently this time . nothing like skiing your bibs open all day . upon returning lodge , i found out one seams inside split , too . promptly threw pants out after , no sense re-packing them cross country flight ! spend your money elsewhere instead throwing it away these pants	-1
these slippers thick , fuzzy , very warm . cuff folds up keep your ankles cozy your toes ! they rubber , non-slip bottoms so you go out sunday paper without put your shoes . price more than reasonable this much quality ; not mention , choice lovely , feminine colors . i would recommend these any one	1
why some companies seem think simply adding more fabric make something fit bigger woman ? it too short , didn't flare out all skirt , halter part so long it sagged , so thin my chest fell out sides . i specifically looked models shown make sure my chest would fit into it , model white showed it would , but it didn't . i suggest buying this only if you flat-chested want something cut navel front which exposes your rear . i almost believe this designed sole purpose making heavy women cry into mirror . it possible make flattering plus-size lingerie , but i don't think this company knows how	-1
just like any apple product it easy set up , cool use , motivated me loose weight . i'm up 10 lbs . so far	1

picture it shows jacket plain black orange inside . when i got it it patches all over it saying name brand , velcro so when i pulled them off i velcro patches all over outside jacket . i take it seamstress them removed . kind material would easy damage if i tried remove them myself . i very disapointed never order them again	1
car charger wall charger work great make this combination worth price . but carrying case creative zen , while very well constructed very protective , not designed someone ( like me ) who constantly switching songs checking screen . i remove case my belt check screen because there no swivel mechanism belt clip so i view screen while clipped my belt . also , connect unit usb connector , you unsnap cover , remove ear phone cord , then plug usb connector into unit . case itself looks great , however . i just wish its utility matched its looks !	1

i've put lot miles these shoes . fact , i've using them four months . i've ran full ( actually ultra marathon ( 27.2 - lakeshore )) marathon them . they so comfortable light . solidy built . heel back part shoe feels like kevlar . sole extremely padded . shoe fits like glove around my feet . it unlike new balance shoes where you're resting your toes . i used saucony man but saucony shoes would feel flismy after putting some miles them . kayanos , after maybe couple hundred miles , they're still tip top shape . i think they could go thousand more . cons- price little reach but i figured it worthy investment because my marathon running . i feel sole could use little more traction wet surfaces .	1

pros : they look nice , they feel good , break quickly , don't wear out very easily . last time i bought jeans , they also dickies i've them least 5 years . they still haven't even tried develop any holes or rips , even through working hard manual labor . cons : i can't think any . there must not any if i can't find them 5 years .	1

i say after wearing these day they not disappoint . i love boy short look these crotchless panties made usa . they made out nylon so thin wispy it feels like you don't anything all . boy they look good . i just can't get enough looking myself mirror .	1
i think this great suit . my diving class i wear this suit itself like extra coverage compared speedo brief . settings where it not appropriate wear just speedo , i wear it under my board shorts it lot better than pair boxers or boxer briefs	1
shoes low heel - can't wear high heels any more !! but very sassy ! - they fit well make you feel beautiful	1
i agree -- these run large . 7 runs more like 7.5 8 , so try before you cut tags or wear outside . primas lightweight stylish enough wear while running after kids , running errands around town or walking dog . would give 5 stars if sizing more accurate .	1
silicone protective covering treo exactly what i wanted just what i expected it . it fits my treo 650 perfectly i couldn't happier . i am going buy different color	1

i recently got 15 " macbook pro needed larger bag accommodate it ( replacing my manhattan portage 1640 waxed canvas messenger bag , which i loved ) . i ordered returned several things before settling this . i am very happy . it durable , smartly designed bag , pretty much perfect fit macbook pro , stored inside sleeve case . first i thought i would replace my manhattan portage bag , which just barely too small macbook pro , bigger version same bag , 1635 . but bag way too big- macbook swimming there . this bag comfortable fit , little room either side macbook when bag isn't too full . there plenty room carry number regular books ( or whatever else ) addition macbook . it also ideal number smaller pockets - not too many , not too few - storing accessories . my needs , pockets intelligently placed sized so i feel like there place everything , i don't feel like there any useless pockets . most smaller pockets inside main compartment , side opposite one that against your body when you're wearing bag . this makes them convenient access while bag . one problem i manhattan portage bag smaller pockets side that against your body , so whatever main compartment bag would get way accessing smaller pockets . since these opposite side , pockets easy get even when bag relatively full . one pockets key ring , but unlike some bags , this one attached long " leash " , so keys actually sit bottom pocket until you need them . they don't get way when you trying get other things out , but when you want them , you just fish them out grabbing top " leash " . waterproof liner essential feature when i searching bag ( i'm paranoid caught downpour my laptop ) , although this one hasn't put test yet , it seems even better than my previous bag , which always kept contents dry . one problem manhattan portage bag when flap closed there gaps top both sides , near where shoulder strap attaches . although this bag similar design , it doesn't seem same problem . i wish this bag came shoulder pad strap , but my only complaint i'm sure i purchase one separately . price amazon significantly cheaper than i could find anywhere else , so i put my savings toward shoulder strap	1
these shoes gotten lot compliments they look great jeans or capris ! only thing i order half size smaller than i normally wear it fit . they pinch poke bit around toes , but this definitely goes away after wearing it few times wearing those ' sandal ' or ' toe ' socks helps comfort too beginning .	1
i got these socks wear work , since i work " business casual " environment . i made big mistake when i bought them . i should gotten several packages same time . they're very comfortable holding up lot better than my department store brand socks ever . ( one pair those hole after two or three wearings ! ) they definitely thicker than dress sock , slightly thicker than some casual socks , so if your shoes fit very tightly , these probably not socks you want . they not thick heavy winter wool or hiking sock , however . they great my casual shoes , though , work very well my work shoes . i would definitely recommend these anyone looking socks . colors very nice , too . nice get some quality socks aren't shocking white change	1
bought these my daughter . she looking lightweight comfortable shoe , this one fit bill . they comfortable wear work well around house she says	1

lifestride sue slingback sandals best buy shoes i ever made . soft , comfortable , long lasting ... washable . i highly recommend them .	1
they what they're supposed do- no more , no less . i think you might want something bit warmer if you live somewhere very cold . they bit insulated , but when it gets chilly i feel it . mind you , i live atlanta , ga , so if you're colder than , get warmer gloves or some good inserts .	1
controls bounce without compression , stays place ( no chafing or strap slippage ) , great anyone who prefers hook-in-back style pull-over-the-head contortionist models . but -- seamed cups look really retro ( not good way ) under thin cotton knits like t-shirts . think 1950 bras madonna cone bustier phase	1
these just like ones our kids used ymca swim lessons . nice flexible rubber . seems like great quality . kids love how flippers really increase their swim speed	1
my mother bought this me my birthday , i must say i absolutely love it !!! it solid thick , but not too heavy . there plenty room inside organizing . i especially like 2 side pockets inside , good cell phone , pens , gum , or whatever . it also zipper pocket inside , like most handbags . you fit enough stuff here , like it large handbag , but overall size still looks like medium-sized one	1

i wish i would these right after giving birth . they great when you wear pads all time beginnning . disposable pads thick show through your clothes . these feel really good sore nips if you refrigerate them . they not work well me when i go longer night without feeding . they leaked first couple days my body getting used 5 or 6 hours without feeding . i now give these every breastfeeding friend shower gift	1
i absolutely love this product . i nursing over 8 months now using same breast pads . no ; not just same brand but very same two breast pads i brought hospital when i gave birth . these things coolest things . long you keep them clean , they adhere breasts stop leakage just description promises . furthermore , these also great if you planning returning work while pumping/ continuing nurse . they very thin profiles smooth so you won't worry bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many beautiful blouse . first i little problem getting them absolutely clean but i then i used my body glove scrub them while i shower voila ! i not tempted write review any other products i but i just can't believe more women not discovered wonder these things . possible drawback pads nature don't allow air circulation . i suggest removing them long you few hours day so skin around your nipples breathe ... removing each pad after feeding works well me but you know what works best you . any case ; take look price . that all i spent pads 8 months . what bargain even bigger convenience . kudos makers lily-padz . great shower gift too if you know someone who expecting breastfteed	1

i've always problem finding sports bra actually fit came actual bra sizes instead small-medium-large . i also hated struggling kind you pull over your head . natori one great . it comes real sizes so i never feel like i've wrapped rubber band around my chest . it stops movement while i exercise , even running jumping , without strapping down my chest . it good shape i even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes . i love it hooks back so its easy get out . straps wide enough they rest easily my shoulders still provide support . it wicks away sweat . they last forever ! only thing i've ever annoyed metal clasps adjusting straps because they fall right my shoulder blades sometimes dig into them when i sit-ups harder surface . i definitely suggest this bra any larger chested women who move around lot when they exercise	1

i liked men stripe nylon suit several reasons : it nice fit , material very comfortable i liked color . however , after 2 weeks use ( swimming every day 1 hour ) , i noticed color already starting fade . i made sure follow care instructions rinsing it out after every use i never hung it out sunlight . so far , i must say material keeping its shape elasticity , just not color	1
i originally bought case logic quick-lock 320 cd case ... soon i got it home loaded it up cd , i knew it just wasn't going work , moving pages around huge hassle , you remove every page first , putting them back wasn't easy ... so ... i went this case . it binder style , so very least i knew i would able organize pages easily . this good case overall . zipper seems good , binder seems strong , but handle flimsy piece rubber stitched nylon . i bought this case storage not hauling it around so doesn't matter too much . i filled it capacity my surpise there no room add pages ... also , any large capacity binder , flipping pages not smooth action , you guide page up over , it hard flip over any more than 5 pages time . summary : pros : stylish , built well , good quality pages ( cd never slide over plastic)cons : no room additional pages , hard flip pages , flimsy rubber handlei lot shopping around cd case , i'm satisfied this case better than all rest i've looked , but i just think it possible all these companies build better cd case	1

i think i more laugh reading reviews this than bracelet could ever give me . i also find it funny someone give review product they've never used . i purchasing one these so my review justified . this bracelet take away cancer funds ? you could say yes , but then again buying soda same thing . its called frivelous spending . it mocking livestrong band ? well yeah but then again , we weird al bumper stickers doing years . some reviews , i swear i should nexy yo some them wearing " i'm stupid " t-shirt . its joke people , lighten up . oh all you worried people should donate money cause should ask themselves how uptight they get this . take it this way , i donate not care if anyone else knows , but people most uptight usually ones go up people raise thier banded arm front people go " i donated , yes i , got this cool bracelet , which means i donated " . this fad , ones most uptight this upset cause they didn't think it first . so get over scrooge livewrong !	1
i amused both bracelet reviews . such outrage over something so silly . even more amusing spelling grammar reviews . such cheap entertainment !	1
c'mon now ... those you who making fun " fad " simultaneously jumping same bandwagon buying this piece " fad " paying triple something really pure profit should look up word " irony " dictionary . i agree people should give directly charities , but if impulse purchases checkout counter web lead more money going toward charities people who wouldn't normally directly donate , i'm all it . it called taking advantage people desire part something using it some good . gee , what awful idea , huh	-1

i bought four set these my daughter me share . we'd bad experience stick unit wanted something actually gave some real solid protection . these units great . they fit very well , they hold ' pod solidly place they're strong . we've both used them exclusively since they arrived . there one quirk i'm experiencing hannah isn't . i may try one other colors see if it just one i selected or design issue . " tab " holds two shell halves together protrudes slightly when ' pod lies flat surface , this tab tends pop open . one i've using loses it tension over matter days unit pops open unexpectedly . i'll try different one see if this just quirk one i've using . i'd also likely file protruding tab down . 040 " or so help prevent " table contact . " these things good enough it well worth my effort examine engineering find solutions . however , overall , i find these really excellent covers our use style .	1
i bought this my husband he very satisfied quality fit .	1

if you like real leather bags classic stylish , without screaming one particular trend or label , then i'd suggest this one . i just got it true red , its gorgeous . i probably get myself white one summer . it even prettier person , doesn't look " wide " or bulky it appears here . it falls just your chest hip , which perfect , lays nicely against your body . don't let this photo fool you , it not clunky looking purse picture would suggest . also , i got mine tj maxx $49.99 .	1

whole rubber wristband thing gotten out hand . your part put it rest buying regular wristbands . when it all charities before-thats okay . but it ridiculous now . heres rules : -livestrong = okay because original -everything else = no . -people who wear like 5 them = probably main reason why you'd starting wearing regular ones . plus they're way better not some cheap piece rubber cost . 2 cents make . anyways ... end fad !!!	1

i love calvin klein shirts . they fit slim tight so they're not everyone but if you like fit then they you . careful thought because ck makes some cheaper shirts don't hold up well , but these stretch ones terriffic worth price . spread collar nice because it not too huge -- i read if you long face ( opposed round ) then spread collar best , seems true .	1

if you're tired one-color dri-powers ( which very functional ) this adds bit style keeps original functionality . particularly if you huge expanse shoulder-to-shoulder area , this breaks up monotony little . monocolor dri power tees work fine but these make wear interesting enough not look like something you'd wear shirt , not under your shirtthe material just good , wicking away sweat fast . i've realized wicking keeps dampness creating gym sock smell . fresh sweat , gross it sounds , doesn't sickening odor . when it gets evaporate fast , you last little longer before smelling like socks . i find dri-powers most valuable if you go bike get coffee or small groceries you don't want people store maintaining perimeter around you	1
i bought these shoes go black dress i recently purchased . i hate get new pair shoes one outfit but there no way around it . i'm short but hard time shoes any kind heels because my feet fairly wide somewhat flat . i'm usually mindset you get what you pay but this case its not true ! these shoes not only inexpensive but extremely comfortable wear they're adorable !	1
these comfortable give smooth profile under trousers , however , they too high wear many low-rise jeans pants . still , good value price	1
all all i extremely happy sturdy product . it off-black but it better testimony its advertisement than phony product i got c-in2 . i surprised i ordered small that what i got . it envelops my torso shoulders doesn't sag like other tank tops . pretty much if that size you ordered then you get it . i ordered product 23 february got it 27 february regular shipping , so i pretty psyched they surpassed their shipping obligations . i know where get my designer tanks now . great job	1

these slippers wonderful . they really warm , they strong supportive enough you go outside them ... like get mail .... soles thick enough , so if you step rock you won't get hurt . when they get dirty you throw them wash all your other clothes , theyu come out like new . i recomend puting them dryer though , bring them back their " brand-new " quality , even though they dry just fine without dryer . only reason thses slippers not 5 stars because they tend hold smells , so inside footbet get kinda smelly after while . but despite this i strongly reccomend these slippers .	1

well , why not ? you've got very decent amount colour choices , you pick brass silver buckle . i picked silver black combination , when it shipped it more then i expected ; same exact thing local mall you would pay twice much that not considering tax . only difference this one other belts similar design i've seen they all seem logos , either engraved or cut out . i don't enjoy sporting i giant logo my waist . i much rather get what i want pay less it . buckle not design opens closes , rather you slip belt through buckle tighten it sliding metal bar foward . if you close it tightly enough , it hold lot weight , far more then open/slip belt through/close buckle belt design . i carry bunch things mine , including heavy multi-tool , knive , phone , several pouches filled various manner junk , tape measure , occasionally heavy construction tools . granted belt wasn't meant this kind weight but ... normally after few minutes my old buckle would just pop open weight ... no such problem here . it opens closes without trouble fit large waist easily . what more you want belt ?! =) andrew christian speedy enough shipping it ; it came few days after my amazon order , which 3-5 business days . great deal	1

these crocs very unique . they comfortable footbed cradles your foot . they shaped like birkenstock , but closed cell foam instead cork footbed . closed cell foam very lightweight but dense so you walk around comfort . i wear them just everyday work . i chose closed toe model without holes top because i work laboratory where your feet exposed not good idea . ones open holes top offer more ventilation . , because crocs float water , they make great shoes boating or kayaking . they drain well dry out quickly , plus if you manage slip one off it bob surface until you fetch it . i know lot doctors nurses wear these because they allow you stand comfortably hours time . they also great because they very easily washed off completely just couple minutes . i wear them when i am gardening too then just wash all mud off shoes hose outside . short , crocs comfortable versatile shoes . treat your feet buy them today	1

( definitely not " rugged " suit ! ) i didn't problem too hot , although perhaps because this springtime new england . i wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute quite short .	-1
i love these boots so much i bought them every color leather type available ! they very comfortable yet stylish enough wear dresses skirts . i hate pointed toe shoes worried these might prove too narrow , but toe area only gently pointed so they feel fit fine . also , i fairly wide foot typically wear clogs socks , but these again worked well me . leather soft i assume give little over time which just means slightly thicker sock my huge stash . also , there minimal padding so sock helps cushioning . sometimes i unfold flap make boots bit taller . i only wish they version truly came just below knee . i'd buy every color , too	1

i purchased last years model at202 ( not pretty , but same functionally ) took it my trip peru 4 weeks . bag huge it well separated so you divide your things exceptionally well . it wheeled , carried ( top handles ) or hefted your back . i put bag heavily loaded my back carried it 3 blocks cusco . while it wasn't most comfortable carry - it allowed me move faster more easily . one thing i concerned older bag zippers . one point teeth not meshing either top or bottom sections i worried they ruined . but i simply ran both zippers same end ( using small force ) teeth seemed fixed . i really love this bag use it often all my travels , so potential zipper problem only thing i mention . i highly recommend bag	1

i bought my first pair berks qvc i loved them . i wore them many places i could because comfort , i simply refused change shoes . only thing shoe ran over quicker than i anticipated so i buy three more pair . heel not last long walking or running shoe esprit --- only draw back . since inside shoe molds your feet , it reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight . when i lost weight after my baby , i lost weight my feet well i start wearing bulky soxs my berks instead stocking . when i first tried my berks , they little tight slightly uncomfortable but after walking around them two days it loosen up molded my feet , ----- once happened they very comfortable then . thing i love it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right they uncomfortable . we wear same size shoe give or take few minor width inches here there , but because berks molded my feet imprint my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable . yes , yes , i love little feature .	1

orvis must employ some high-priced copy writers their catalogues , because their customarily high-priced clothes need all sales acumen money buy ( perhaps orvis passes their salaries you ... ) . hence , their ' why buy one pattern when you get get more ' pitch . any event , if you can't get sale item you like better than this orvis.com, you'll least feel you got halfway decent price this thick , warm , surprisingly good-looking sweater . while not made ireland , it sheep-yarn-crofter-whiskey-handmade look , you lie its origin ease . medium heft fits its design function , colors coordinate well : you not look garish or overdressed . short , it one their few patchwork type items really works ( " irish cap ) . examples this concept taken ridiculous extreme , look patchwork madras , just one example . while you're it , find corduroy pants dogs it . it " country gentleman " steroids ; hamptons after few too many ethanol teas . but this good one ... you'll like it . please note two things : back not patchwork but tan-beigy solid ( that ok ) , while it machine washable , it best hand dry it or dry clean prevent shrinking wear .	1

i tried this bra in-store . bra fancy pamphlet attached explained how technologically advanced bra , so i thought it would work really well . wrong . i tried 6 different cup/band size combinations just make sure it wasn't cut issue . each bra , i jumped up down few times see what kind support i getting . then i jumped wearing my normal underwire bra . i exactly same support my everyday bra . it possible this bra works well smaller cups ( i am 32d ) , but if they can't support larger busts , maybe they shouldn't try sell those sizes ( especially those prices ! )	-1

if you used levi or regular wrangler jeans , here some help choosing right fit this . this jean " slim " version classic cowboy cut jean wrangler making since 1947 . among levi jeans , fit this jeans most similar levi 512 , but it cut slimmer seat . it doesn't much orange stitching levi , back pockets sit higher . it zipper fly . so-called " rigid denim " looks lot like " shrink fit " rigid denim levi button fly 501 when new lose lot indigo dye first wash , but that where resemblance ends . 501 shrinks 10% , but wrangler shrinks less than 3% , because it sanforized . so , you should buy your correct size , erring side slightly larger if you right border . compared regular wrangler cowboy cut , this slim fit quite bit skimpier . slim fit seat smaller legs pretty trim--it more boy cut . if you really thin side , it may work you , but many men find it too constricting waist seat . wranglers stonewash finishes pretty mainstream compared some more exotic things levi doing now . these definitely not so-called " destructed " jeans . you won't find whiskering or abrasion way you stonewash levi . overall , these very solid well-made jeans offer nice alternative more popular levi models . like levi , they well made indestructible .	1
