" balls " squeezed into box flattened . taste not very " peanutty " . i'm disappointed	-1
this salmon jerky so unbelievably tough , it pretty much inedible . when you painstakingly gnaw it , it doesn't release much flavor , but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks your mouth . i misfortune ordering this , 7 8 bags still untouched , i'm not sure what them . i even tried soaking jerky , tried boiling it some macaroni , nothing seems soften this stuff up ! what waste money . go some beef jerky instead , if you need salmon , eat it fresh or canned . this product joke	-1
we've enjoyed these cookies months they available purchase our local costco warehouse . just purchased them bulk here amazon terribly disappointed find they arrived hard rocks stuck together . they don't expire until july , 2007 , so we're guessing something happened them storage ? we opened several packages they're all same . reason i am even taking time write this review say amazon online policy states grocery gourmet foods not returnable . you kidding ? i case $30 cookies simply not fit prime time snacking . i've e-mailed customer service regarding my delivery . it doubtful i'll order grocery items again i assumed return policy defective goods would same . just not worth hassle . update : amazon shipped us replacement order . unfortunately , again , all twelve packages hard . each package three rows cookies , each row stuck together each cookie must pried next . actually , it mute point doing this cookies simply inedible they hard , hard , hard . date package : 11 jul 07 , i suggest problem exists this batch , either storage or manufacturer .	-1
although this good coffee , i expecting something tasted like cappuccino . this coffee tastes nothing like it , it doesn't even hint cinnimon flavor package suggests . if you want regular coffee , then this coffee buy , but if you're looking cappuccino , save your money	-1

these cookies ok , just ok . i may inclined give them three stars they arrived whole cookies , every last cookies broken . i understand this probably due poor packaging . consistency bit grainy dry though . milk not help . next time i'll purchase chewy brand or mrs. fields	-1
this very weak coffee . not buy unless you like it way	-1
great idea poorly executed extremely unappetizing presentation . this someone who makes flavored rice few times week . said , this worst review i ever given anywhere , so bear me . you know how sometimes rice sticks bottom pan if you overcook you boil it out it turns oddly clear but covered carbon water ? yeah . like . rice came out sticky ( not it palatable uniform japanese steamed rice way ) almost alien kind translucent brown nothing like picture . nothing . if you look closely , you might able tell it once rice . yes , i followed instructions . my husband , who wanted try fresh rice work , described it abomination , which relief me because when it cooking it stenched up house horrifying yet familiar odor when i put my finger it smelled exactly , exactly , like onondaga lake syracuse ny summer back when it most polluted lake world people warned never eat fish they caught ( assuming there any alive there ) kids weren't allowed wade it . it smells like raw sewage , dead fish , rotting feathers chicken soup . it 45f out i opened window . sometimes you buy case something it turns out something you don't care , maybe it too much onion or whatever , but you know someone else like it . normally i donate these things needy family . i think this case it would cruel . i can't imagine anyone who made rice their own mistaking this rice . yourself favor just drop boullion cube pot your stovetop rice . that what they're trying here failing miserably . i can't sell rest auction site because i'm afraid even if i am completely honest smell i get bad rating . only thing i think use them smoke out people breakroom odor next april fool day	-1

when i think " dark roast " i think full bodied dark . melitta pods worst i've tried . i've tried senseo pods too which only mediocre . i find target brand " archer farms " pods best . french roast really rival starbucks home brewed . its cheap too ... 3.99 18 pods . if you like full bodied , rich , dark strong cup cofee , don't melitta . i found senseo archer farms pods fit my melitta pod brewer just fine	-1
mushroom soup one my favorites , so i very disappointed this version . i agree totally first reviewer - this one bland tasteless soup . i'm only giving it any stars all because it organic attempt appreciated .	-1
i bought case these amazon because someone some candy forum claimed these " excellent " quality they comparable premium brands like haribro . don't believe it . these cheapo gummi bears , no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore/supermarket/bigbox sells . pretty squishy ( not very chewy ) , variety bland flavors all taste mostly like sweet . there no point buying these	-1
stay away ! amazon sent me 1 bag coffee pods . 18 pods total , not pack 12 like advertised . unless you want pay $30+ 18 generic coffee pods , stay away . i returning my product asap	-1

while i personally love eat tons organic natural foods , i say $30 i spent this case cookies waster . neither my children eat them , nor i . they smell once you get your nose hinders any attempt enjoying very small bit flavor they . nature path makes great cereal energy bars but fall short these cookies . stick chocolate or peanut butter you okay . honey grahams sit your cupboard until trash day	-1

i really excited ordering this set thrilled when it came . i noticed something unexpected teas , however . teas i tried this set i noticed unpleasant dry aftertaste . taster noticed same thing without my mentioning it . i really like glass tea pot . it very nice watch tea fill glass orb color flavor . whether flowers beautiful or look more like sea urchins matter personal taste . i high hopes starlight rose tea ( white tea leaves rosebud ) found it far inferior rose petal black blended tea republic tea , which excellent . other hand , numi moroccan mint one finest teas i ever tasted , superior old favorite mine- stash tea moroccan mint . after tasting this tea i am surprised number reviews rating tea comes set quite good . maybe i got bad batch or strange taste buds- but there it . bamboo box quite charming	-1
i bought whole box these , they tasted really rancid . they several months their expiration date , so wasn't problem . maybe i just got bad batch , but i'd unlikely ever try them again	-1
when you dirt your food you wonder what you really eating . otherwise flavor wasn't bad . i just can't eat dirt . it bad teeth	-1
i love flavor this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged . packaging needs contain little tlc , then it would 5 stars . don't order if you need this certain dinner , it may not arrive usable	-1
but i may never know . i ordered this item october 27 . when shipment finally arrived , there only one container this inside ! i ordered four pack i'm sure . so amazon offered try again sending item , but it now november 30th . item stock whole time so i'm not sure what caused delay . i'm just thankful i ordered it just try it out , i didn't actually need it any certain date .	-1

home beyond true value offers this 12 pack coffee filters 40 each pack . i ordered two 12 packs 40 coffee filters each home beyond only sent two packs 40 . not 24 packs i ordered paid . my advice not business home beyond or true value when buying these coffee filters because they not ship what listing says . until amazon starts enforcing home beyond true value honor what they list their offerings , imho then buyers need go somewhere else . weight says 4.20 pounds . they trying say one tiny pack 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds ??	-1
these horrible . i thought i'd try raw foods i amde big mistake	-1
i've found timothy k-cups consistently good , better than green mountain varieties i tried ( i haven't found green mountain i like yet ! ) but parisian night first timothy offering didn't impress me . i bought two boxes it amazon tried using different brew strengths , but it always tastes bland . it bold strong advertised , but plebeian . someone who just bought keurig this blend their first cup , it might taste pretty good ; but compared all other , better k-cup varieties available , this one better off skipped . i think it just fancy name boring blend nothing distinctive it all . their " midnight " dark roast definitely more tasty , even better than their columbian italian k-cups , which very smooth . i think timothy best columbian k-cups market . but parisian night , well ... let just say everybody makes mistakes	-1
i bit disappointed these . they crumble very easily unusual texture . my son ( 6 ) not like them	-1
skippy pulls worst kind nonsense this product - claiming it all natural , which technically true , but also implying since it natural , it healthy , which false this product sice they ruined it . real peanut butter contains one ingredient : peanuts , maybe dash salt . nothing else . real peanut butter very good you . skippy adds palm oil , tropical oil which , while it slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils , still contains saturated fats completely unnecessary , this " spread " . why ? so poor widdle you doesn't spend whole four seconds stirring it . course , this would all lot more clear if amazon actually nutrtion labels available , but they don't - nor they carry any kind actual all-natural peanut butter . skip this , skip all so-called " peanut butters " carreied here , go yoru local store get soem real natural peanut butter . look label - if it any other ingredient than peanuts salt , put it back shelf . nothing else necessary	-1
i drink all types teas , but this one worst tasting teas , my opinion	-1
i wanted like this bar because it high protein fiber , but it also unfortunately high added sugars ( 31g ! ) . it much too sweet . if they took away some sugar , it might edible .	-1
quality this tea not very good , especially compared other superb teas two leaves bud . mostly powder inside bag , very strong " grassy " smell somewhat bitter aftertaste . top it took 2 weeks amazon deliver it .	-1
donot buy it . i got stuff even past expiration day	-1

i wouldn't describe this jerky shredded but instead powdered . it not something you tap into your hand eat like snack . best use we found pour one little tubes onto salad added protein . still , it fairly short shelf life jerky ; unopened tubes gone bad ( mold ? or something ? ick ) within 3 months	-1
it not regular , strong earl grey twinings i come love . this version lacks strength flavor - two teabags needed regular strength tea . it even states box - light flavour strenght ( 2 leaves out five ) . beware !	-1
newly re-packaged twinings earl grey tea ( word " classics " package ) much , much weaker than previous twinings earl grey tea . if you used like old teas , then you won't like new version . i wonder if they weakened britsh version twinings earl grey tea	-1

5 stars stevia product ... natural , delicious ! 0 stars amazon inability correctly store this item their warehouses . i experienced same trouble other reviewers , packets showing up hard useless . when purchased store , i never one hard or brittle packet . don't bother purchasing amazon , instead head your local trader joe where you purchase 100 packets $5.99 . not fiber supplement type , but doesn't clump more per packet . amazon really shouldn't even bother selling this product if stevia shows up ruined	-1
i should known there something fishy when product details said product dimensions 13 10.5 2.5 inches 3.8 pounds when shipping weight said 2.15 pounds . actuality it 12 10 2.5 comes cheap ( not even know if it wood ) box it weighs 1.14 pounds my postal scale . however , fair , i not taken plastic wrapper off because it gift so it could very , very thin wood . addition , container opens like box rather than chest . there no hinges back . i am very disappointed this tea " chest " it price	-1

this purchase my husband . ( need i say more , ladies ? ) this soup(if you even call it ) waste money . there hardly any seafood it all , what little there , it small pieces . it more like ' cream ' . my son husband both big soup eaters , love chowder . let just say he bought case stuff 10 cans still sitting pantry awaiting next garbage day ! i admit i didn't try it ... it didn't smell or look appealing . but if my husband ( human garbage ) says it awful stuff , i take his word it .... so should you !	-1
edited review : my first order came leaking jars . amazon replaced second order arrived good condition . one star , which i can't seem change , reflected fact . my updated review three stars . i mildy disappointed this topping . out jar , black olives artichokes provide flavor definate sour notes . texture ingrediants pasty ( opposed chunky ) . i would given this only two stars if this supposed pasta sauce . however , i followed directions jar create their version bruschetta . it acceptable . since this billed " topping " i am willing give it three stars since capacity performs pleasurable level . vodka sauce much more my liking .	-1
if you really like chinese food , you might like this chicken stew . however , it much too sweet tasting my tastes . main reason i give it 2 stars it contains artificial sweetner splenda ( see " sucralose " ingredients ) , but not advertised anywhere package besides small print ingredient list . i personally don't eat or drink products contain artificial sweetners various reasons , i known product contained splenda , i wouldn't purchased it honestly . it typical splenda " after taste .	-1
it not quite bad i expected , but strawberry delight flavor frosted mini-wheats suffer most how it looks , unnatural pink color dyed into wheat biscuits such way make them wholly unappetizing . otherwise , it offers sweetened taste barely reminds me real strawberries , least point where you wonder what point this variation kellogg . one 42-gram serving , mini-box , equals higher-than-average 140 calories but only five fat . other good news there no measurable sodium cholesterol cereal . i would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would preferable this cereal , so i think i'll leave this pass	-1
i bought two flavors gloria jeans k-cups . i loved price . coffee wonderful (!) , but i hate getting grounds my coffee ! i've 1 5 cups coffee grounds * under * filter , so when coffee brews they end up my cup -- 1/2 teaspoon per cup . lower price = poorer manufacturing standards .	-1
says it all . this cereal just too sweet . their flax cereal better	-1

although i like consider myself open ' cultural cuisine ' , i found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying $6 it international marketplace . my significant other same . i like salty stuff , i love licorice , but this just plain nasty . not only it too salty , but it terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor went up my nose made me wonder if perhaps candy tampered or manufactured incorrectly . i went online read some other reviews ... other people similar experiences . i guess it one those acquired tastes developed early . oh , those dutch !! i love ' em ( but hate this " candy " )	-1
i ordered both this honey nut version . i wish i paid more attention low fat part this version . this version hard too cinnamon/sugary which seems happen w/ some low-fat cereals . they compensate low fat sugaring it up end up w/ hard less tasty less filling product . however , honey nut version very good . it good crunch , but not too hard tasty almond slivers it . it sweet , but not overly granola , no cinnamon taste all . i understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon i typically like cinnamon , but this version too much raisins too dried out hard . package very convenient though . i now mix regular version w/ this product help me get rid low fat stuff . some label info : low fat w/ raisin ( lf ) 180 calories per 1/2 cup while honey nut ( hn ) only 20 more 200 . there 12 1/2 cup servings hn while lf only 10 . product weight hn 24 oz lf 20.5 oz . finally sugars hn 11g while lf 15g	-1

i purchased diamond pecans their shells december ' 06 ( note , not these , already shelled ones ) discovered after kids eating them they all rancid . sure check dates ( if you , there weren't any in-shell nuts ) because there not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying make rancid nuts . i learned only purchase pecans places dates package or where i smell taste them	-1
i agree quality nothing sneeze . these fill me up , i know they're pretty good you , i like nutty essence too . i guess i really disappointed taste , though . chocolate slightly bitter-tasting , took me surprise . i love other flavors , but this one my leat favorite . i would recommend almond butter balls before this one , they're soft little more sweet side	-1
i bought these because they described : " 100% all-natural dry roasted almonds " . now i read label states these contain : maltodextrin , modified potato starch , sugar , msg , autolyzed yeast extract , modified corn syrup solids , modified corn starch , salt ...	-1
this terrible tasting bar . i tried many raw bars this one far worst i've ever tasted . it leaves after taste .	-1
this type machine just cannot make good espresso . espresso must made fine grind beans , correct temperature water , high water pressure extract right amount flavor beans right amount time . quick/no-fuss machine like tassimo , some these ingredients missing this machine process , so espresso turns out rather sour . adding latte milk covers up worst it , but it not great latte either . stick regular coffee tassimo , although it not wonderful either , it might get you through morning	-1
not fooled this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry ! i long time fan original pop-tart go-tart just seemed like natural progression things , so i went newest technology mass produced baked goods . go-tart offers you pop-tart go , because everyone knows this 21st century we move . i'm venturing guess go-gurt success so why not make go-tart ? well , there number reasons . actually just one . you already eat pop tart go . it too bad go-tart ruined everything i loved pop-tart . greatest hope i this flop product frosting ( or what you'd like call sugary stuff top ) would reach corners tart , unlike original pop-tart . though sugar covers corners , there barely any frosting all this tart ! it but thin line sugary goodness we would all expect normal pop-tart . filling gooey consistency , worst all , breading part crumbled my hand . i eat my go-tart pieces . this clearly not go . this worse than pop-tart , probably more fattening than one . save your money , boycott go-tart	-1
i excited get these but not read ingrediants before purchasing . big mistake . me they far too sweet almost sappy tasting . i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some those chewy snakcs they make kids . high fructose insane really i feel they would better off fraction what they add .	-1

not great coffee . rocamojo puravida , which amazon also sells so much better -- those aren't great just good . this cheap coffee tastes like it . i can't complain much $3 pound but it just ok , drinkable , but wouldn't buy again .	-1
i'm sorry , but these just weren't me , they somewhat stale taste . i recommend buying single bag before buying case if you all hesitant	-1
too salty me , there better brand out there	-1
they sounded good , but aren't tart enough my taste prepared too much sugar	-1
i thought this product reasonably good taste , but i two major issues it . first , they describe this kettle corn . it not kettle corn - not even close . this caramel corn thick sweet coating . real kettle corn slightly sweet , slightly salty popcorn . second , each very small bag 1.5 servings it . when last time you opened small bag snack food only ate 2/3 it ? they purposely made serving size unrealistic make it look healthier . whole point paying individual size bags it limits you set portion . remember when coke 1.5 servings it ? fda made them change label . if you eat whole bag , you eating 200 calories popcorn . no better bag potato chips or few cookies , so this not lesser evil - it just same old junk food new name . i won't buy this product again . it same stuff you get anywhere	-1
i bought two flavors gloria jeans k-cups . i loved price . coffee good , but i hate getting grounds my coffee ! i've 1 5 cups coffee grounds * under * filter , so when coffee brews they end up my cup -- 1/2 teaspoon per cup . lower price = poorer manufacturing standards	-1

espresso beans roasted different ways . lavazza illy represent best two different approaches roasting beans italian espresso . illy roasts their beans longer time , but lower temperature , than lavazza . result its higher roasting temperature lavazza darker , according some people more robust , than illy . its best , when properly ground , tamped , brewed , lavazza espresso bit stronger tasting also little bit more bitter than illy . lavazza espresso also very pure black color once brewed when it properly it hint licorice aftertaste . personally , though , i prefer illy approach which why i am giving this coffee four rather than five stars . but , even so , i certainly recognize high quality lavazza . my opinion lavazza represents very best widely available dark ( opposed medium like illy ) italian espresso roasts	1

now , one reviewers this product complained sugar content this cereal only looking ingredients list , which not how determine nutritional value any product ( especially when reviewer cannot distinguish nutritive non-nutritive ingredients ) . this cereal just many simple sugars frosted flakes , but cereal not claim low sugar . what important this cereal it offers quite bit fiber vitamins/minerals ( not much some cereals , but since i no deficiencies this area , i didn't mind ) . also , it only 3 times salt half cup milk which not loaded . healthy choice soup , now loaded salt . now , i chose this cereal replacement frosted flakes/honey nut cheerios , which against my better judgment i continued every morning . i should point out i don't drink coffee mornings i don't drink soda ( less than 1 week average ) . i also eat no sweets . simple sugars ( listed just " sugars " nutrition label ) seem treated like carcinogens , while most people don't realize aspartame ( artificial sweetener most diet sodas ) really one . if your diet already low sugar you feel confident you burn through those sugars pretty quick ( since i don't drink caffeinated drinks , i need jolt morning ) , then this good choice . if your diet already quite bit sugar or your doctor tells you cut down simple sugars ( or you also couple cups caffeinated coffee sugar every morning ) , then go bran cereal without oat clusters syrups ( which i really not like much ) . also , if you concerned total carbs , please note normal 2000 calories diet would include 300g carbohydrates ( so yes , high protein diets contradict this ) . since taste completely subjective , i won't put much emphasis it . my opinion , it tastes pretty good ( but i don't consume many sweets during day ) .	1
these cookies nice break run-of-the-mill granola bar . based oatmeal , not too sweet , filling . great value . i would purchase again	1

i use this mostly my coffee tea find it adds kind sweetness i enjoy . i've others try it some liked it much i , others said it wasn't them . i remember reading years ago stevia slight licorice taste it , but i don't detect any sort taste all . my online research leads me believe might something inulin fiber ( fos ) thats also part this sweetener . i tried splenda didn't like it . everyone tastes body chemistry different , but if you're looking reduce amount sugar your diet without feeling like you suffering it , then give this try	1

this best tasting shredded (= dessicated ) coconut i found anywhere usa . it organic sulfite free . this unsweetened , finely shredded , very small pieces dessicated coconut which used south east asia , australia etc . this not same product american style coconut , which most common type baker sweetened angel flake coconut . i like buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because i often bake australian , british european style cakes cookies , which not work well when made flake coconut . i also discovered finely shredded coconut used make your own coconut milk or coconut cream home . flake coconut dessicated coconut different taste texture . cup sweetened angel flake coconut 2 tablespoons sugar added it , so it very sweet compared shredded/dessicated coconut , which no added sugar all . shredded/dessicated coconut drier pieces very small compared flakes , so it more surface area . because these two things , 8oz dessicated coconut absorb more liquid than 8oz flake coconut . some recipes work quite well either kind coconut , but others not , even if you compensate sugar liquid . its better , especially baking , use whatever recipe originally calls . coconut i received amazon tasted very fresh good use date . if you want increase shelf life coconut , throw bags into freezer or refrigerator . they keep there year . once bag opened , i always keep it refrigerator . i don't like buying this kind coconut health food stores , it often comes bulk bins exposed air . unsweetened organic coconut get stale or even develop rancid taste if it stored open air . sweetened flake coconut much more stable because it contains preservatives sugar . if you australian wanting make things like lamingtons or coconut ice , you need use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut . flake coconut not give right results . dessicated/finely shredded coconut also excellent replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies you find many chinese buffet restaurants . shredded/dessicated coconut mixed water make your own coconut milk or coconut cream . i find this useful because i rarely use more than 1/2 when i cook coconut milk ( curries , soups , laksa etc ) . sometimes i only want spoonful or two , add little flavor smoothie or banana cake . i tried making coconut milk flake coconut , but my taste , it way too sweet not good texture . make coconut milk dessicated coconut : method 1 . put equal parts coconut hot water weight into blender ( eg 8oz coconut 1 cup hot water ) . whizz blender minute or two . if desired , you strain press it through cloth or fine sieve when it cooled down . this not necessary most recipes , unless you require silky smooth texture end product . lighter coconut milk , use 8oz coconut one half cups water , or you use " lite " shredded coconut start . method 2 . simmer equal parts weight coconut hot water until froth appears . not boil . remove heat let it sit until it cools down . if desired , you strain it through cloth bag or very fine sieve , pressing out much liquid possible . make thick coconut cream dessicated coconut : use either method above , but use 4 parts coconut one part water . i thought price amazon excellent , especially organic product . time purchase , it worked out one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag my case , shipping free . i can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else this price . overall i very pleased taste , freshness , price quality this coconut . i don't think i any problems using up 12 packets one year , especially i won't buying any cans coconut milk .	1
i used these add christmas gift basket , filled special cocoa mix , spiced tea mix , fancy jam spread , three or four scones , family friends .... unexpected company . everyone loved them , i apackage or tow left myself .... they delicious . they such good value money , exdciting addition these gift boxes	1
taste ok , but not great . one thing this somewhat annoying it two serving packet which means it makes 16 ounces liquid . i really only want eat up 8 ounces time . means i guess how much half then roll up bag save remaining portion . even if i want eat entire packet , i don't bowl 16 ounces ( all my bowls perfectly normal sized ) . bottom line here there nothing wrong taste soup ( still , i'm not love it ) . i just wish there better way packaging . i'm only one eating it , maybe affects my opinion . if you more than one person your family then it won't problem all , you ignore everything i've said .	1
i love this tea ! it very refreshing , wonderful aroma . it doesn't get bitter like other green teas . once i tried this green tea , this only one me .	1
i recieved variety pack today tried this flavor first . i buy natural snacks my kids ( freeze dried fruit etc no added sugar ) , but i find them bland . so i ordered these i love them . fact my 4 year old wanted try she liked it - it wasn't too spicy her . you tell they used " hot " spices , but they very well so not too much . nuts big crunchy fruit small chewy . there equal both nuts fruit . they use evaporated cane juice organic tapioca syrup , but these healthier than alternatives there still only 5 grams sugar per 1/4 cup serving	1
i love soups stews i am love this seafood chowder . it absolute best flavor chock full variety seafood . taste great !! i've tried many many chowders this ranks highest any i ever eaten .... even legal seafood or wolfgang puck or several local massachsetts seaside restaurants . it all natural no artificial ingredients . i recommend this everyone who loves seafood chowders . all baxter soups chowders , this really only one i recommend everyone try . i repeat ... it great !! it bit high salt though ..... ~ 1,400 mg/can but if this only salty food eaten all day ... it ok . try it .... it heavenly !	1

when mini-wheats first came out grocery store , i tried them . however , i found they bland . it like trying eat sticks milk . then came " frosted " mini-wheats . okay , i decided give it go . now i sticks sugar milk . however , i find out if you forego milk just eat them straight box , like potato chips , they excellent ! now kellogg added fruity flavors mini-wheat . these i eat milk ! yippee ! finally ! i picked up " strawberry delight " bite size . even though i eat them milk , i find i still prefer just eat them straight box , like potato chips , type chex-mix , or square wheat thin snack . each serving 140 calories . compare other cereals you'll see it 60 - 100 calories less . no saturated fat . no trans fat . no cholesterol . no sodium . total fat only 0.5 according box . i don't see how , since zero zero , well , zero . but i live 0.5 . here bad news , carbohydrates . there 35g carbs here . but same all other brands . diabetics may want pass this due 10g sugar per serving . remember , single serving size half base ball . not much . so if you just pouring cereal into " cereal bowl " without measuring , you probably getting 2 or 3 servings one bowl . all-in-all , unless you diabetic , this mini-wheat terrific ! reviewed detra fitch huntress reviews	1

i love granola cereal general , but i say this very best granola i ever . people bear naked philosophy i love , which back every bag : " we believe food should hand-made wholesome natural ingredients you actually pronounce . " although i eat processed food , i appreciate appeal more traditionally prepared foods , this granola tops list nutrition taste . like most granola , it high calories fat , but take note fat comes largely nuts contained ( it also contains expeller pressed canola oil ) , it no trans fat , only 1.5 saturated fat per serving . this cereal softer than most granola , though not soft enough me consider it chewy . it large chunks nuts also contains cranberries flax seed , optimal nutritional digestive health . six-pack sold amazon makes price per package reasonable ( ingredients quite expensive ) , so value proposition , i think this not only great product , but great buy . delicious nutritious : great combination i recommend highly	1

this one those items i buy regularly grocery store i got less amazo	1
never heard it . some research decided try it . extremely satisfied my choice ! i went " light " version since my research mentioned it one no strong after-taste . much better , natural choice than artificial sweeteners . calories , but glycemic index response very good ; translation : it doesn't give you " sugar rush " . i like things fairly sweet , so i use 2-3 teaspoons per cup coffee . you may need less . definitely get 12 pack !!! best value you'll amazed how much you start using it !	1
you ever described food tasting " healthy " when you mean it tastes so bad it must good you ? fear not ! it pleasantly adaptable use any fruit hand . i honestly say , though , it earthy quality . it may take uninitiated some getting acquainted -- just little ! if trying first time , i heartily recommend trying hemp goddess supreme recipe jar label . surprisingly palatable ! you'll proud something nourishing healthy yourself . easy digest . powder indeed rather coarse . when you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal , you won't mind . including this one eating habits only addition positive	1
this one great products we love envirokidz ! gorilla munch panda puffs both favorites our house although we eat all their gluten-free cereals . i highly recommend their products those needing gluten-free products especialy when making transition kids	1
this my favorite gluten free cereal hands down . let face it- it isn't nutritious . this not health cereal . but thank goodness ! it also won't send you absolute sugar shock , either- i love peanut butter flavor . it good light snack breakfast- i bet it would good recipes too .	1
i love this cereal ! some unknown reason , most grocery stores not carry it i lot difficulty finding it anywhere . i'm glad find it online , but see it currently unavailable amazon	1
i just love this cereal - it sooo crunchy tasty - i eat them right out box don't feel guilty ! they aren't sold here anymore so i'm glad i get them here	1

please realize these not cookies much crackers . they sweet taste , but don't expect oreo taste hazelnut much more subtle than other tastes . overall , excellent - i very much enjoyed them	1
amazon delivered exactly what i ordered time . me , nutiva vco great alternative unhealthy cooking oils . if we compare short-chain fatty acids ( such lauric chains coconut oil ) which metabolized within mitochondria cells , versus longer chain-bearing oils which require conjugation transport liver , i think vco must healthier me overall . nutiva also tastes good frankly people , it great lotion . yes , it takes few minutes sink , but once it , you soft skin .	1
reviewer called this " genetically engineered horror " ( same review gave high ratings poptarts ! - not they taste bad , but they pretty high sugar artificial stuff ) . i believe name company " just tomatoes " name product " just rasberries " . freeze dried fruit hardly genetically engineered horror . it just rasberries-nothing else added very good taste very healthy . i like rasberries strawberries best . i used them my cereal , snack out box , yougurt smoothies . if you like certain fruits when they not season don't care frozen , these fit bill	1
this very tasty bar ! i tried almost every raw food bar market this definitly one best ! it not too heavy tastes soooooooo good ... i mentioned it yummy ? lol .	1

ah , it definite american story - 1969 friends mo siegel wyck hay colorado began selling herbal teas they previously only made themselves . such small beginnings came famous tea company - celestial seasonings . among celestial seasonings ' many products sleepytime , herbal infusion such wonderfully different taste i able win my wife over it , she not consider herself tea drinker . many evenings when i brew up some sleepytime go my famous spiced bread ! anyway , sleepytime largely mixture chamomile spearmint , which produces healthy drink wonderful aroma taste . i'm sure i cannot adequately describe taste - it doesn't taste like anything you've ever tried before , but its seductive flavors win you over . if i could make one suggestion celestial seasonings , it would change name something else . i've friends refuse try it , afraid tea make them feel drowsy . you buy sleepytime valerian root , which definitely promotes sleepiness , but regular product just pleasant herbal drink . i suppose it called sleepytime because its fresh spearmint tastes very good late evening , its natural lack caffeine means it won't keep you awake . but , this wonderful product tastes great any time day ! way , it also makes unique , zingy iced tea	1
we glad see amazon started carrying this kenya blend . after discovering it europe bringing several pacakges over , we later some shipped us family belgium . this nice subtle yet defined taste i particularly like it afternoon cookie ( covered belgian chocolate ! ) or biscotti . recommended any senseo lover tired regular blends found retails stores	1
i actually drink this cold . i brew entire pitcher it ( hot ) then put it fridge enjoy cold beverage . this tea nice mango ( not overpowering ) flavor both refreshing crisp . i yet try bentley tea i haven't enjoyed , so i wouldn't hesitate recommend this flavor , or bentley general ! good stuff	1

i've miso soups various restaurants this actually really good . i love fact they environmentally concerned their products . i'll buy their products just knowing they care so much how much we throw away , so it biodegradable . only thing i'm not crazy noodles , i would preferred thinner noodle , only because it so bulky , not really typical asian dish	1
finally there quick way make great udon soup home ! any udon fan , this must try product . noodles good udon noodles get , soup mix great base start your udon . here way we make udon using this product base : we take noodles soup mix two packages ( bowls ) , add some additional soy sauce spices we like , boil it all pan ( you don't need screw around all noodle rinsing , just throw them pot ) . when soup noodles warm , we add chopped romaine . this super good , costs less than $[ ... ] two large servings udon - deal any standard !! when we really want full-on udon , we add some sliced pressed fish like restaurants use traditional udon ( half moon pressed fish , white orange/red coating ) shrimp . this heavenly !!	1
picked them up local whole foods we love them -lots crunch - my lasy loves seedlander i love muesli - i highly recommend these	1

very high quality meat just enough spice , processed just enough make it slightly soft . if it wasn't so addictively good , i'd order bag right now !	1
yes , this beef jerky hot . that why it " hot spicy . " if you always order your mexican or chinese food mild , i'd say get different flavor . spice blend ( which mostly hot pepper ) pretty good . quality beef good or better than any mass-market beef jerky you pick up your local store . big difference ? this stuff 1/4 price . if you like beef jerky , buy this brand . there no better value out there unless you're making it yourself . i'll probably order some every time i order books	1

annie chun rice express sushi wraps rice bowl wonderful product , tastes great , most all , kids love it !	1
i ordered this when it gold box deal i would order again even higher price . reading reviews just reaffirms old adage you can't please everyone . i'm happy there no added flavor rice . rice quite tasty it . we gone culture modify everything ? today world we don't taste what we prepared eat . we only taste condiments we pour onto or into it . i thought wraps where big enough . how hard it roll sushi goodness sakes . i thought salt taste wraps added little rush flavor when i bit into sushi . all all i think this great option lunch good value . roll your own helps you slow down your eating allows feel full just time you munch last bite . tomorrow , i think i'll add some tuna ! yummy	1
this great buy i recommended it everyone . i would use amazone again all my needs	1
product very good delivered promptly . i am curious know why it hard find local store shelves	1
not instant , package says . fair , package also , somewhat smaller less prominent print , detailed statement telling buyer microwaving/cooking necessary . but if you just look package front , you'll get impression you make this like you make instant oatmeal . not so . i hate using microwaves , so big turn-off me . all said , stuff delicious definitely warms me up fills my tummy , keeping me getting hungry better than most oatmeals . texture thicker heartier than regular instant oatmeals , kind cross light muesli oatmeal . i make mine , add 2 ounces organic skim milk , i'm good go . sweetness light wonderful , no overly-sugary yuckiness .	1
both my mom sister gluten intolerant , so i used many gluten free products make cakes or other recipes family get togethers . this best cake mix far .... this cake mix just good wheat-based mixes . i modify it make various kinds cakes : coconut cake , red velvet cake , etc . it always gets rave reviews , even those used eating wheat-based cakes . ( my mom sister tolerate vanilla pudding , so i add one third half box instant vanilla pudding - regular , not sugar free - per bag cake mix make it extra moist . ) i also use gluten free pantry chocolate truffle brownie mix ; it better me than any wheat based brownie mix	1

kellogg fruit harvest strawberry blueberry packs huge punch great taste it contains no fat , no trans fats no cholesterol . it relatively low sugar carbohydrates , too . despite fact this one best tasting breakfast cereals out there i am disappointed its vitamin content . artwork box leads you believe this cereal just very healthy you . yes , it 25 % your recommended daily intake iron , niacin , vitamin b12 , vitamin b6 , riboflavin , thiamin folic acid ; but i expected this product healthier still . i take off one star make this four star review . it low sugar just they say it . however , if you aren't getting proper amount exercise you need , then extra sugar strawberries , blueberries corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body . always , when planning diet , it helps consult your physician before starting new diet . nevertheless , strawberries blueberries taste delicious -- even when you eat this dry drink milk it . kellogg fruit harvest cereal offers whole grain which important part any healthy diet . overall , kellogg fruit harvest strawberry blueberry breakfast cereal great choice start your day . sure , it may not absolute healthiest cereal your grocer shelf but this cereal beats junk food mile . buy some enjoy today ! smile	1

price this product ( many others ) via amazon excellent compared " whole paycheck " types " healthy " supermarkets . i'm totally pleased this cereal . it tastes great , but surely sugar content boosts its taste appeal . organic or not , sugar sugar , many advised keep their distance it . nature path should consider using alternate sweeteners , such , organic course , brown rice syrup or raw blue agave syrup . macrobiologists would jazzed	1

i long time lover black licorice dark chocolate . but since recently discovering rjs , i would say , if given choice piece best dark chocolate piece this licorice , hands down i'd going latter . i astonishly surprised my first bite - wonderfully soft intensely flavorful . i enjoyed fact it didn't stick me teeth or make me feel i give my mouth workout enjoy it . amazon offers this great price too . i've paid considerably more	1
i purchased this candy my father my father-in-law . they both thought it some best licorice they ever tasted . they liked fact it soft easy chew but outstanding characteristic flavor . both them could not stop talking natural , " old time " flavor candy . i think they disappointed if i don't buy it again	1
i old , rather beat-up percolator i bought $1 neighbor lady during garage sale . it terrific . easy make coffee , coffee tastes great it takes up little counter space . but i would get these grounds my coffee cup , i didn't like it . enter percolator filter ! these great , because grounds really no where go . my grocery store used carry ( but stopped , which isn't good ) disc filters , which just sit under grounds , but don't wrap around them any way . so grounds still sneak into my cup ( though it better than nothing ) . also these make disposal easy . just tip your percolator basket thingie ( i percolator but am clearly not expert them ) upside down , filter falls out you ready pot joe . thank you , melitta	1
agreed , there no reason these people put so much salt . other hand , there no way i'd confuse this stuff campbell . like most cream soups , it benefits bit added milk , but we like it lot	1

though i'm not into so called " guilt-free " foods eat mainly fruits , vegetables , whole grains , beans low-fat dairy , i days when i need make sure i get enough protein pinch . these soy chips often fill gap , new baby house ( who cared full time his mom lieu various mechanical other devices such swings , bouncers , teddy-bears womb sounds , etc ) i'm not cooking quite so much . plus , i don't much taste meat , though i'm not vegetarian . i don't eat many processed foods , these soy chips lower end processed side things , my opinion , they don't bunch dyes , perservatives , etc , just soy flour , rice , oil , salt , spices ... one could much worse . particular , i found them helpful road trips when you don't know when you'll encounter something decent eat ( don't room cooler ) plane trips . few pieces fruit , i've carried through many dicey food situation these non-perishable soy chips . 2 hour ride airport , 2+ hour flight average 2 hour luggage retrieval dash hotel or other lodgings long time go without something eat these days superb airline service . besides , who ever really liked , or much less could argue sound nutrition airplane food anyway ? chips pack lot heart healthy soy protein ( 24 grams per 385 calorie bag ) , low fat sugar . also , bag compressed much smaller size carry-on economy if you don't mind some crushed chips . they may not salad healthy entree cover page meal , but they giant leap up vast majority vending machine , convenience store , grocery snack aisle trash . downside them they relatively high sodium , but if rest your diet pretty low salt you aren't trouble blood pressure , you're probably ok there . i really love new amazon.com grocery venture because one , i get these soy chips 12 packs . price works out just over 50% cost per bag i'd pay any grocery store where i live . when i two cases time get over $25 barrier , i get free shipping which really seals deal . my dad kids me i'm amazon.com junkie whenever he sees package amazon.com his box , he knows who sent it . this not prompted plug amazon , i just really like their service , grocery especially	1

it odd my taste buds reported me opposite reviews here . i'm disappointed , i paid this premium price based 5 star reviews . i'm old enough remember " old time " licorice sold 1 cent ( even 5 penny ) flavor consistancy i looking forward when i purchased this licorice . i some anise spice my cupboard baking , i just tasted it make sure i didn't my spices mixed up . based comparison ; my verdict this licorice tastes strongly anise ( not licorice ) . i thought it much too soft . there no " chew " it . it mushy . only thing i think compare it soft cheese , such havarti . it even softer than mild chedder . sorry ... only 2 stars me	-1
these apples coated sugar other gunk ( like sunflower oil ) which gives them strange taste . i very disappointed when i tried them . i wanting nice dried apples taste like apples instead oil , sugar preservatives . now i'm stuck two bags product not very good . i also got stuck dried strawberries which even worse . i not trying any more stoneridge orchard products . aware !!, these products cannot returned amazon so sure before you order	-1
my own fault not reading ingredients - but marketing info this product extremely misleading . basically , it $10 bag blueberry candy . high fructose corn syrup second ingredient - oil flavoring also added . i don't anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling hours after i ate it - i actually brush my teeth twice . this product should not natural organic category - don't waste your money	-1
these far best tasting spirulina bars market . whole line more desert like concept , so course they sweet chewy . people ibs probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts should read ingredients before buying !! food safe celiac , most food allergens ( again read label based your dietary situation ! )the bars travel very well although they may bend mush , because they naturally moist chewey , melting ? never . all bars this line travel great sit months hot or cold . these particularly good athletes people run . oh , price , come , there nothing else even comes close size quality	1

very nice wooden tea box . make nice present . i not tried teas , though	1
so these basically ritz bits , but three differences : 1 . crackers better ; they taste more buttery flavorful . 2 . cheese better ; it actually tastes like something that met cheese passing , maybe even shaken its hand . 3 . they're all organic ' ' stuff , so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous , less like slave big food . if you're packing lunches kids ( or snacks yourself ) , these great	1

one reviewer writes these oreo crackers without creme -- they right ! these thin oreo crisp wafer type cookies nabisco easy pack when you're run just need quick sugar infusion . they also make snacking anytime day -- or night -- they give you great oreo taste without actually using creme ingredien t.t hese crackers cholesterol free trans fat free -- hooray ! there only 100 calories serving serving contains only two grams fat . they baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy french fries . these crackers somehow manage give you full oreo taste experience while omitting creme fair amount calories , too . excellent ! these oreo thin crisps come six smaller packets which inside box you buy . this makes them even more portable both children adults . advantage cookies coming smaller packages inside box you know each packet pre-measured contain only 100 calories . this way you can't accidentally eat too many take more calories than you wanted . i notice these crackers made cocoa . please consult your doctor if you any concerns caffeine . chocolate cocoa could contain too much caffeine you if you sensitive . i recommend these crackers persons go who want quick snack . they should provide you sugar boost quick energy . they make healthier alternative other snack foods loaded fat and/or cholesterol . buy some enjoy them today ! smiles	1

these teas ( both raspberry blueberry ) priced lower than grocery store ( $3.49 per individual box ) , where they usually seasonal item . this frustrating since my husband i hooked them probably brew drink full pitcher per day . they best tasting cold ice teas great antioxidant benefits . this seller shipped them promptly they very well packed . we repeat buyer sure . a+ !!!!!!!!!!!	1
this dream ! quick-brew _and_ blueberry ! it slightly slower brewing than plain lipton quick-brew tea , but it brew up three minutes . it definitely blueberry flavored , it little red color . we impatient flavored tea lovers , this great product	1
i recently decided give these diedrich k-cups whirl . years , i've dedicated green mountain coffee roaster customer , their k-cup varieties excellent ; however , even their " cafe express " discount rate , their coffees more expensive several dollars per 25 count pack than current price amazon offering diedrich blends . i'd traveling southern california few months ago tried some diedrich coffees then . although coffees i tried tended exhibit starbucks/west coast tendency roast beans too darkly -- point effacing some original regional characteristics beans -- they fine dark roasts preferable what i've starbucks . coupled keurig brewer , this makes decent cup medium-to-dark " west coast " style coffee	1
if you ever mood summer sausage but don't feel like cutting piece off large log , these ticket . they great taste perfect snack ! highly recommended !	1
this best home style sushi kit . you get basics , excellent rice , sushi wrap sheets , soy sauce . i made these added thin sliced cucumber smoked salmon rolls i assembled them . best !!!! possibilities endless !!!! try it you'll see . sometime i all thumbs , but this very easy quality food excellent	1

so delicious so healthy . fresh crunchy - much better than peanuts . i love these soy nuts	1
i love these crackers several reasons . they absoutely delicious , begin . they not use ingredients like " partially hydrogenated soybean oil . " they hard find stores . it hit or miss thing , here northeast . so i ordered amazon . propmpt delivery , ease purchasing keep me coming back	1
i love my coffee machine but i normally not buy t-discs gevalia due price . but found this amazon = wow 2 1 ! price great , even when you add any cost shipping etc . still beats " bead bath beyond " coupon ! service delivery excellent	1
i am addicted wasa crispbread multi-grain you too . very crisp hearty flavor . healthy product no saturated or trans fat . only 60 calories per portion . other wasa products also worth try - especially sesame	1
that all matters me . i can't always find it stock local store , i want my husband able enjoy it . i'm not real coffee drinker , but this kona blend seems lack bitterness first turned me off coffee years ago first place . so i enjoy some it too occasionally . , whatever blend he drinking , my husband likes millstone brand . i know it always smells wonderful	1
i very pleased these dried cherries . they delicious -- not too sweet , not too tart . healthy , too	1
nice flavor aroma . i like darker blends , this little light , but still flavorful .	1

it not get easier : become addictive so many only 25 min . away	1
i don't know how it someone took rice made it taste so good , but i eating these several months now . they extremely addictive . sometimes i find myself getting up middle night just eat them . not too sweet , no stomach reaction someone like me , who can't tolerate gluten . i tried all flavors , they equally satisfying . course , this processed food no live nutrients they say , but its only snack i eat really when i buy processed foods	1
like ingredients taste , it just little bit thick " flatbread "	1
some products better dozen , but i think i would rather opted variety pack if i buy 12-pack zataran . if you reading this review , then you probably already tried dirty rice , since you buy dozen packets it . so you already know it decent mix ( we add our own spices it give it even more kick ) .	1
i bought this add variety my diet , tried teff pudding recipe back - delicious , i think . my family didn't agree , but they like bread i made teff flour . hmm ... perhaps if i soaked grain overnight first , would make smoother pudding . try pudding , or add grain mix breakfast or side dish - it healthy it tastes good .	1
taste good spiced well , but it really dry hard .	1
these 1 " squares low fat sugar , so parents feel good serving them their kids . i wouldn't say they deep chocolately taste , but healthy snack they're pretty good	1
i just received my box sun crystals i not rave enough this product . i never tasted low calorie sweetener close flavor sugar my life . i am big time splenda fan , but this smoother taste it ... although not quite powerful splenda . i use 2 packets coffee normally it perfect amount sweetness without overpowering . using one packet tea just enough sweetness take bite off stronger teas , but not ruin flavor high end teas . all natural , i feel like it must healthier me my family than other low calories sweeteners . this only one i actually feel ok giving my children . i recommend this product highly anyone who uses low calories sweetener . don't forget type $5 discount code	1
spelt pretzels fiber hard come . organic boot ! my family used eat vita spelt until i realized there no fiber them they weren't organic . much cheaper amazon than whole foods	1
this cereal absolutely delicious ! it even tastes good if you eating it chips ! multibran high fiber content good your health , too	1
my search non-bitter ( stevia ) , non-artificial , non-refined sugar sweetner over last ! i hesitated buy this because requirement buy 12 . boy , am i glad i buy whole box ! we use this everything , including baking , find it really good taste . most sweetners ruin taste our fine coffees , but agave simply supplies sweetness . we'll trying amber agave next hopes heartier sweetness winter baked goods	1
after illy espresso bars italy , well , no other espresso tasted good me ! illy tastes great made good pump espresso machine . it also tastes great made steam espresso machine ( e.g. , low end krups ) moka ( italian poor-man espresso maker ) . rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts . everyone i've made illy espresso raves over flavor compard espresso chain coffee stores . tip when brewing espresso using steam espresso machine : shut off valve before any steaem comes through coffee . high temperature steam leach unwanted flavors into coffee . i used buy illy local stores , but prices over $11 per , sometimes $12 . i happy see amazon start carrying it even lower price . if you can't find illy good runner-up lavazza , however , its flavor isn't intense illy	1
we love these crackers . my kids all eat them , i keep bunch my backpack emergencies . they crunchy nice aftertaste . they smell really good too	1

this best jerky world !!! sooo good . juicy flavor . i eat it all one day . all gone !! spices kinda hert comin out though	1
i order several bags this hot spicy . it grit texture like it sand it . i wrote company found out some bags manufactured larger grain sugar than they intended . this caused grit texture . they sent me replacement bags , replacements wonderful . excellent flavor texture . give them second chance	1
my all-time favorite flavor pop-tart , but no stores my area it . thank you amazon !!!	1
baxters soups usually very nice , but lobster bisque especially good . it tastes authentic , it good flavour , creamy , just enough lobster bits make it interesting . add some fresh black pepper dash brandy or sherry it rivals soup served very good restaurant . it also surprisingly low calorie . though nutrition info here says 130 calories 8oz , label actually says 120 calories , so even if you ate whole lunch you would consume only 220 calories	1
unlike other reviewers , i not like fruit rollups or leathery fruit bars any kind . these bars soft chewy very satisfying . they great snack keep handy . i would highly recommend , especially if you person who doesn't usually like other types fruit leathers , sticks , rollups , etc	1
i like way this tastes , but it not fantastic . it fills you up ( fiber expands ) keeps you regular . honestly 2/3 cup your set breakfast . i don't know what wrong last guy who posted . i'm pretty sure he some dude who thought it would funny write post some old guy unfortunate run bran . nothing goes through you fast . bran not laxative . its bulk forming fiber . i wouldn't really care except this good product	1
this keeper . best i found , so far . light airy . make peanut butter jelly sandwiches .. doesn't need toasted like others ... makes " mean " french toast ... my daughter ( who pretty picky ) eats this bread lot .	1
i loved blueberries raspberries , but not cherries . i thought fruit ( all types ) bit too sweet . they added lot sugar it . otherwise , it healty snack	1
love these granola bars . they healthy you don't force your children eat them . these two very good reasons buy them	1
not most economical way buy this , but packets convenient cheesy garlic delicious without overpowering	1
if you like peppermint then you love this tea . it one celestial seasoning superb products . very warming relaxing	1
ok , i'm eating this stuff , i don't eat cereal . what tell you ? it tells you it pretty good . it organic , so i tell myself i am helping out my body eating it ( which probably not true . ) $3 per box delivered , i don't think i'd buy this , but amazon deal i got them $2 each , now i am considering loading bazillion ' em . this prime member find . maybe i'll mix rest flavors , 6 boxes time . comes $ . 40 per bowl , not counting milk half banana	1
they great , my groom huge cashew fan my mom both more than pleased . they not heavily salted all , we pleasantly surprised , salt more fine powder than what you would expect salted product . they always live upto best peanuts va , we send them people all over country they all hooked	1

these crackers bes t-t asting saltines we've ever . we love them ! they light , not too salty , delicate smattering olive oil . ingredient list short -- only four items ! i buy them case our family four they don't stick around long enough get stale . they great take party if you're serving crackers cheese . i strongly recommend them .	1
if you judge this snack packaging , you might never try them . baked pea pods don't exactly sound like most appetizing ( or satisfying ) snack , but these guys really deliver . one other reviewers said , they crunchy light , texture similar cheetos , possibly little more dense . they taste lightly salted snow peas , only light airy . while they might not healthy raw or steamed vegetable , they're good alternative if you don't want all chemicals sugars most packaged snacks . these guys no sugar all ingredient list wholly recognizable . i usually buy two bags time because they tend go so fast . both flavors delicious , though i prefer original . since it appears amazon no longer carrying them , you might try wild oats , trader joes or whole foods , if any those nearby	1
" cubicle commando " pringles often find their way into my bottom left drawer . they staple food this environment . i suspect dibert would derive almost 30% his nutrients these ! i love pringles ! however , i've come conclusion i need buy them traditional tube because whenever i buy them " convenient " snak pack , i'm lucky get half them aren't broken or crumbled . what point pringles if you can't eat then whole ? packaging makes difference . maybe you'll better luck than me , but my take it	1
this product so disappointing i discarded entire box after trying one bar . there much better raw food bars market terms both nutrition taste	-1
i very disappointed this product . i wanted use them snacks pie crusts , but they too stale use . they not crunchy advertised since moisture definitely entered through packaging . unfortunately amazon not let me return them , so i'm out $20 . i going try some other products this brand , but now i not	-1
okay , yes , i know brand dr. kracker maybe should clue texture this product . however , i flatbreads made other companies actually texture pita . these very crunchy don't whole lot flavor . additionally , they shipped arrived expired . if you shopping super-healthy cracker , this may it . if you looking whole grain flatbread texture pita , keep shopping - this not it . my next venture this product grind it up use bread crumbs top broiled tilapia	-1
this product way too salty . i didn't like it all , neither any my family . you can't get taste out your mouth either after tasting one .	-1
flavored peanut butter short-lived quirky product line 30+ years ago . it bad idea buoyed few years cute name , catchy jingle , generation sugar-addicted children , adolescents " munchies . " now , pb max trying this idea again . far i tell , there no good use , nor nutritional value , this product . it phony , overly-sweet flavor doesn't taste like snickers or peanut butter not good any kind bread unless you really weird cravings . come , would you take real snickers bar make sandwich out it peanut butter ? if so , you might find this product convenient if inferior-tasting alternative . this doesn't melt evenly so trying use it sauce prove frustrating . it gets oily separates doesn't work well dipping . yes , you could spread it apple slices or eat it straight up if you so inclined . i'll go real snickers bar or plain apple slices , thank you very much . you could also get this your kids eat , but please try better parents than ! note you buying 6 jars this once , so even if you find niche use it , you'll quite bit it use up . i'm betting you'll get tired it long before it gone	-1

i made mistake purchasing this 12 pack without testing it stores first due glowing reviews this site . i sweet tooth but these so sweet it nauseating . i couldn't taste any caramel or other flavor , just straight sugar . if you considering this product haven't tasted it before , i highly recommend you purchase small bag first so you don't waste your money	-1
i very disappointed when i received dried cherries . i not realize they included sugar sunflower oil . when i opened package you could feel oil cherries . i rinse them hot water before i could use them . this information not included anywhere description	-1

while i like all kashi products i've tried , this one my favorite ! little fresh fruit , how much more healthy you get ? great taste seven grains sesame ! perhaps other reviewer threw away cereal ate box	1
we initially discovered this cereal one big warehouse stores , but they not consistently stock it . we enjoy flavor , fact it made organically-grown grain , health benefits flax seed high fiber . time purchase , we found amazon price over dollar cheaper per box than our local grocery store . we bought two cases !	1
i like nutiva hemp protein . great protein source easier digest than whey also provides half daily required amount fiber . can't beat ! it won't leave you feeling heavy bloated like whey sometimes . i like taste texture too . mixes great cranberry juice/cranberries , stevia , ice water ! i add some berry green extra energy nutrients ! it my morning breakfast .	1
my doctor ordered me eat heart-healthy food , saying raisin bran one best bulk count . he said it good idea not only eat it breakfast , but also eat small bowl before dinner , especially those over age fifty who might tend towards constipation . it sure beats " prunes " my mother day ! i always liked raisin bran , this packet 70 individual boxes last me little over month ... if i follow my doctor advice . i also enjoy convenience amazon new store staple groceries . only drawback i see finding extra storage space if i order everything last month .	1
these really great . they very sour when eaten alone , but amazingly good cereal or oatmeal . great fruit hand , especially when they out season	1
my kids love these lollipops ! so my husband ! flavors great they perfect size - not too big not too small . they taste better than other artificial ones you find grocery stores	1
i love this popcorn this such bargin price compared store price . thanks amazon !!!	1

i little hesitent make big order so much tea , not knowing if i would like it . so i went local supermarket bought tin there so i might give it taste test . this quite good green tea . other than buying generic green teabags , i usually buy bancha tea . this tea not grassy , more bold slight smokey taste more kickiness i t.t he cannisters nice their inside foil liner keep tea fresh . only thing aware this lot tea , altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters . unless you really love this tea , plan making some gifts	1

my mom first sent my husband box his care package - he stationed north baghdad , iraq - it best thing he ever received . army 24 years , he his share bad coffee , but he doesn't wake up anymore . i sent him six boxes hazelnut , mocha , french vanilla . he says hazelnut his , but he shares rest . it big hit his unit all commented awesome taste army coffee significantly improved ! we won't allow him run out box or two added every care package my mom i send . nothing but best troops	1
i tried most jack links ' products . i classified this one good ... but i personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier .	1
i use plenty this product regularly when making ice cream , cookies , cakes etc ... i find this product sort natural sweetness or flavor its own . because this much less added sugar needed baked goodies some cases added sugar eliminated . obtain this , i use this organic unsweetened coconut combination organic whole milk .	1
these definite time saver couple faults which reviewer pointed out -- no flavorings rice , nori cut too small . get around rice problem , just add little rice vinegar sugar rice it comes out quite good . i don't particularly like wasabi but they should probably add packet box those who . nori sheets taste good fresh if maybe slightly salty my tastes . stated before though , they definitely cut way too small . you cannot achieve any kind decent looking roll them , but if you aren't picky what finished product looks like if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin , you get it hold together long enough eat it . bottom line ten bucks i paid 6 packages , i'd say it definite winner 6 cheap fast lunches taste much better than they look . i can't eat one sushi roll local sushi bar less than 8 10 bucks . now price these gone up little , i'd probably consider just buying larger size annie chun precooked sticky rice containers ( if amazon gets them back stock ) providing my own full size nori sheets .	1
i never big cereals until i tried this one . now i'm hooked . thisis very flavorable cereal nice mix strawberries blueberries . it great anytime you " munchies " but don't want eat empty calories . it also best all cereals thatadd fruit	1
earl grey my favorite blend tea far - no competition there . biggest secret this tea once given earl grey hoswick hall ( british prime minister 1830 - 1834 ) chinese manadarin , reportedly gratitude after earl saved his life , get just right doseage bergamot oil , rather intense , tangy scent derived bergamot orange ( which turn cross pear lemon sour orange ; latter native south vietnam , its oil probably recipe original ingredient ) . using too much bergamot oil easily obscure black tea natural flavor - but twinings you just can't go wrong , because original earl grey turned this very company match quickly dwindling supply he received his chinese friend . ( twinings website : " when mandarin tasty gift began run out , earl grey asked his tea merchants , twinings , match it him . twinings unique blend grey family long-standing favourite . when guests inquired it , they directed twinings strand , where they would ask earl grey tea name . " ) unless you insist * all * your tea cream or milk , i recommend this one without any kind milk products : not only original recipe not call such addition ; my mind it just plain ruins blend particular flavor . ( but that just me , course . ) whichever way you it , though , if scented teas your kind thing , twinings earl grey should right up your alley	1

warning : boring review follows ! ha ha : i interested buying these individual servings cereal my family wondered if cups , bowls or little boxes cheapest per ounce . cups hold more than bowls boxes(usually twice much based cereal type ) . i mean we would eaten 2 bowls if it really cheaper way . i went kelloggs site compare how much cereal cups versus how much individual bowls or little boxes . bowls , cups boxes all seem end up costing fractions pennies one ounce per ounce . i didn't add up all kinds per variey pack see which grand total costed pennies more or less based ounce ( i am not frugal ) , but picked corn pops frosted flakes compare . prices all kinds very comparable , so if your wondering which type buy , it doesn't really add up much difference . i check these things because sometimes big " value " sizes actually more expensive per ounce/gram than little sizes . those marketing people tricky ! therefore , if you want more little bowls or you pick cups ( more each ) , you make your choice know you won't spending way more either way . i skipped choosing boxes because i liked convenience bowls , but honestly carboard boxes probably better planet ( but anyway , i save some energy , water , soap not washing bowls ! ) now all they need sell cute little dispenser my counter i never go back boxes	1
i love jerky tried it all including making my own . this first product i consider good or better than mine ! price great	1
principle , this great product : it actual fruit , nothing added , dried crisp put packet only 85 calories . if you're looking light , healthy-ish snack foods still tasty , this great choice . but there couple problems : 1 . packets very narrow long , which makes it virtually impossible reach into them get fruit out , once you're past top third or so . 2 . there decent amount fruit dust inside -- which , these berries cherries , red , just waiting bit added water stain up any fabric it lands . either these isolation no problem , but put them together , you've got product you must pour out , yet product you can't pour out . i guess maybe if you bowl or something , it wouldn't big deal , but sort takes away portable-snack nature it , no ? much i liked fruit , inconvenience packaging going keep me buying more . oh , one more caveat : despite " cherry berry " name , this least 50% apple . i suspect apples dried fruit mixes what peanuts mixed nuts , inexpensive unobjectionable filler . apple tastes fine all , but i wouldn't mind more cherries berries , fewer apples	1
prompt service i got what i ordered . i coffee good , but not outstanding	1
this cereal like rice crispies it taste good but better fruit . there also erewhon crispy brown rice ceral mixed berries much better me although i not able get it lately . this great gluten free product those who avoid gluten products . celiac disease suffers always looking tasteful foods gluten free . i hope more products become available bulk us .	1
