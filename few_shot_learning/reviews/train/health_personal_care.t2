wow 5 blades instead three ? who would thought ? i smell noble price here ! don't let great cosmetic design fool you . it turned out same thing but more blades . i really excited waiting my brand new fusion power razor arrive , i am allergic shaving so this big issue me . after first shave my hopes destroyed . it turned out same thing . they even mentioned blades closer improvement , when fact , i think they forced it way because if not they would ended up huge cartridge would not fit contours face . only obvious new feature trimmer , which only , feature , not real technical advance . i hope someday these companies start invest part income they get overpriced cartridges research development , instead investing it marketing . way , my power handle came broken , so i couldn't test this feature , although i power handles past other blades difference minimal . what next , let me guess , 7 blades ? i guess these guys should really start working something new because " adding more blades " thing getting exhausted .	1

i paid $45 this aesthetically pleasing scale . sure it looks nice , but if it doesn't its job , it not much accessory bathroom . it took me while figure out how scale works . there lot beeps involved . essentially , program your info , you start pressing mode button , adjust your height , press mode , adjust your age , press mode , select your gender , press mode , select normal athlete , press mode you hear beep confirm . then store , press either up button memory #s 1 , 3 5 or down button #s 2 , 4 6 , press mode there beep confirm . still me ? if you just want your weight , you just step scale , but if you want get your body fat water % , you must press up or down button find your memory # , then press mode wait beep before you step scale . now i don't know you , but this procedure lot more cumbersome than any other scale i owned . so fine , i've now figured out how work thing . getting even somewhat accurate results thing . when i stepped scale , i would sometimes surprised weight . i didn't think i could gain 7 pounds one day ( i eat very healthy my weight range usually 3-4 pounds ) . but if you step scale again , like some other digital scales , it seems remember your last weight won't give you your real weight . so i put some other object it get reading then scale resets . i step scale again my weight now 6 pounds less than original reading ! body water % didn't fluctuate too much body fat % 3% higher than reading last scale i owned ( conair thinner brand ) . all all , i am returning this scale going back drawing board finding something even least bit accurate .	1

my braun thermoscan given me nothing but trouble . yes this ear thermometer easy use . you just stick it into canal correctly . not hard . what i don't like you stick it same ear , same way , 6 different times get very different readings . everytime i gone use my thermometer , battery would dead . you use special medical circular batteries , so course i would never any handy . then i got smart started stocking up batteries . they expensive . everytime i would use it i'd put fresh new battery . this also needs disposable ear covers order it work . yes there trick getting around it but then your thermometer isn't sanitary . finding covers sometimes easy sometimes impossible . i just never happy it . yes it easier than oral ... but i found one even better . try temporal artery thermometer . you use one sleeping child	-1

i cracked heals bit callous problem . they aren't dragon feet , but they softened pretty often . i used little blade scraper tool few years works well but when i saw artemis heel smoother advertised , i decided i try it . it waste money . appliance no more than low-tech dreml . fact , i dreml type tool marketed dog nail trimmer works better . artemis appliance not scrape any dried skin away .. it merely sands your foot bit .. when you get darn thing stay spot you put it . it comes small container foot conditioning balm probably just straight cocoa butter except it really offensive aroma . i would just soon use piece sand paper than this thing . save your money .	1

( this hottest setting several passes over hair)-because my hair so thick , iron needs reduce volume . t3 failed this respect , too . -i thought i would like larger ( almost 2 " ) iron surface . t3 perfectly flat surface , which made it impossible get flip or curl ends . needless say , i returned it quickly pricey salon getting chi ! perhaps this brand would work better someone fine hair , since temperature adjusted	1

i purchased waterpik na-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment , expecting it work waterpik professional ultra dental water jet , since what advertised . they don't fit this model , so don't waste your time purchasing both together ! sinus attachments too short , so they can't " click " into water pik . end result : water leaks out , there no pressure through sinus attachment . i return both items since amazon rep couldn't find any sinus attachment work waterpik ultra model . it shame because i love small footprint waterpik ultra , it comes lot cool attachments . hopefully waterpik come up something near future	-1
i owned this set 2 half years before i finally just gave up switched different brand hot rollers ( i used it 4-5 times per year ) . first off , rollers very heavy so when you them all place , it feels like you carrying laundry basket your head . second , rollers hot touch so burning issue when rolling up your hair . third , clips used hold rollers place fantastically difficult use . i would roll up my hair ( which would take like , 30 minutes because difficulty ) , if i walked around house watch tv while i waited my hair set , clips would spring out place shoot across room . i eventually lost like 6 clips " springing out " thing . results these rollers great , though . i used them my wedding day people loved it . good results , but not worth time effort use these rollers	1

reviewer who compared massage feature cell phone perhaps said it best , so suffice it say one essentially ignore aspect unit [ i might even liken vibrations those injured ( no longer airborne ) housefly buzzing circles ] . respect heat(ing ) , it perform better , but no means stellar . pro its design moisture , better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well auto shut-off . con include , others said , huge ac-dc plug/power pack , no apparent ability wash darn thing , only modest heat , annoying velcro straps , two-part power cord not only must taped keep together , but can't removed main pad washing , perhaps most significantly , fact mine died after approx . 18 months ( which , incidentally , raises yet detractor ; warranty only year , much less than many other brands )	1
if you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes , this thing works acceptably well , but if you're mixing something like " ionic fizz " magnesium drink fizzes up bit , it not very useful because it just doesn't form very good seal , no matter how tightly you close it . reviewer mentioned , it very easy cross-thread lid . thicker threads deeper threads would probably help . it great sipping though , easy enough keep clean . but i went back using plastic 16-oz milk bottle always forms tight seal when you close it . seal this bottle too flaky because it difficult tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it . i'd expected bottle designed shaking mixing drinks would paid little more attention problems this . i don't use this any more , because it too annoying worry seal cross-threading . don't waste your money it .	1

if you want my review nutshell , here it : two defective rise shine lamps . one call verilux . verilux refuses help . if you wish learn how this sorry state affairs came pass , read . my verilux product experience : i exchanged my first verilux rise shine natural alarm clock bedside lamp due non-functional internal speaker , ostensibly loose wires shaken loose during shipping ( if i am understand verilux ' company president response similar defect report these reviews ) . good news : speaker second unit now works . contrary some other reviewers i feel mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would even better choice ( line-in jack cd player or ipod ) . bad : despite jumbo lcd display might lead you assume am/fm tuner digital , radio completely analog . station ids printed roughly 7-point type tuning dial instead -- small enough some owners need their glasses magnifying glass select radio station . contrast , i own alarm clock conair similar analog tuner , exception it uses roughly 8-point lcd digits represent radio frequency lower right-hand corner backlit lcd display . verilux ' comparatively enormous lcd , i am left wonder why design team failed consider option . analog tuner without station display something i expect $15 drugstore alarm clock , but not product this type , which otherwise very well thought out . unfortunately , due apparent flaw shade and/or lamp itself , shade my replacement lamp -- lamp i received store exchange -- won't sit straight ! one remove shade , look lamp level surface , see lamp " shelf " slope downward such shade itself also similarly slanted ! making situation worse , lampshade also slightly off insofar ring not centered . there three metal supports attached top shade bent downward welded ring sits half way down ( typical most lampshades ) . ring , turn , sits lamp body ( or shelf ) . whole assembly cockeyed , including socket into which bulb sets ( very obvious angle) ! cosmetically speaking , there also problems surprising see product this type . whereas first lamp i purchased very prominent nick plastic edge alongside lcd panel , replacement lamp scratch ivory plastic lamp body inch below shade shelf , it , too , must obtained manufacturing . shade itself , it came out plastic wrap beige blemish , roughly 3/4 " , looks like pale stain against bright white linen . so while second lamp not doa speaker , i apparently traded one problem . worse , lamp appears lopsided even opposite side room ( would probably appear way down street if i set it curb ) . short , verilux rise shine lamp just not up quality price/warranty suggests . case you wondering if this might " gray market " merchandise , it wasn't . i purchased my rise shine lamp straight out high-end , authorized retail store , new-in-box . am/fm clock radio paired sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light , finished off eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained space-saving design roughly 6.5 " wide base 20 " tall -- makes outstanding combination concept . this reason , i hope verilux continue refine rise shine model , particularly where quality control concerned . given i am gadget fan , someone who rated products 1/5th price this lamp very highly , it should understood i really wanted give this positive review . but two duds row ? ironythe rise shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers contact verilux directly instead returning defective products retailer . given my replacement lamp also defective , i followed these instructions . but reality , verilux wants defective merchandise become retailers ' problem , not theirs ( per instruction i received make third 40-mile trip back store where i purchased it ) . conclusion ? verilux doesn't back their warranty ( my experience/opinion ) . nor , apparently , verilux care what kind impression they leave firs t-t ime customers . so if you think impressive three-year warranty help you if something should go wrong , consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience . believe me , there no rudeness involved provoke this kind reaction part verilux ' customer service department , either . what verilux apparently forgotten this age internet . it so happens , i supplement my income writing product reviews websites . fact , i am writer training/trade . translation : verilux chose wrong customer let down . i no intention smearing verilux ' reputation -- unless telling truth nothing but truth my experience qualifies such . would i recommend this product friend ? yesterday i might said yes , chalking up non-operative speaker first lamp fluke . today , coupled fact verilux seemingly not wish stand behind their products even when it would take mere lampshade keep customer happy , my answer resounding no . should anyone verilux read my review , i wish close this thought : i could learned live cosmetic problems i noted , but ~ $5 lampshade , replace one blemished right out box -- doesn't sit straight , boot -- not worth keeping firs t-t ime customer happy ?	1

i'm cursed sensitive skin tough beard . i'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i carefully prep shaving . after years trial error , i've finally settled good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser base , then kiss my face moisture shave supplement . post-shave comfort prevent breakouts , i use product like cleanclear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , weak link up until now actual shaver . gillette fusion power , i've finally found right one . i've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during first gulf war ( i marines time ) . they've gotten job , but 3-blade system ultimately inadequate my beard skin type . it doesn't take long blades start cutting my face neck , especially since i take forever change blades . i dreaded looking bathroom mirror work seeing dried blood spots ( not mention getting blood stains my collar ) . electric shavers don't work me either - too hard my skin , i'd five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it shot . i initially skeptical powered aspect due my issues electric shavers . but fusion power happy exception . first i struggled bit getting battery cap off end . but once i mastered maneuver got battery , i set . it takes one aaa-battery seems last decent interval ( low-battery indicator nice touch ) . even if fusion power runs out juice , you still shave it . shaver glides over my face , vibration feels good - kind like pick-me-up morning . five blades really nail my beard , even tough spots like my chin jaw line remain cut-free . i also like one-blade trimmer top - very handy evening out my sideburns zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue expense blades . but i make them last lot longer than old 3-blade razors while still getting great shave . most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i , it more because rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , result worth higher price . gillette fusion power best shaver i've ever tried . highly recommended	1
i surprised open this pedometer page after sometime see all negative reviews it receives . i using this specific model more than 3 months now i am really satisfied it . it really accurate ( lt ; 1% declination , i performed more than four tests more than 400 steps during different times its life i seen couple cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly belt or pants , displays time conveniently nice backlight , even radio which works , although most people said , not really its best feature . truth i am not using radio all , mostly because i believe batteries last longer it save me extra trips walmart . but i tested it it works , although nothing impressive there . course , money , i think you cannot go wrong this pedometer . one funny comment , although most people complain it cannot open very easily , after sometime it open more easily you think . actually it couple times where putting bag my shoulders or waist pouch applying some pressure it mistake , open it wide , so it not count any steps . but it not open itself anyway , needs external force this happen , so it not happen often . all all , i am sure plastic construction less than rigorous production testing result many pieces not function properly result bad reviews . maybe i lucky , maybe not , but this one best most reliable devices i carry use every day . great incentive walking exercising more	1

if you burn lots calories your activities , this high energy food could give you lift . there 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which advertised least 70% organic . this bar advertised athletes first , casual snack second . if you overweight trying drop pounds , you skip this snack move back unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed it looks like compressed goop . however , compressed goop tastes pretty good . texture much like granola bar , though more moist than granola bar . black cherry part black cherry almond understated . there dried cherries this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which big plus . i unable find anything this bar implied it artificial , which even bigger plus . one thing confused me little bar advertised no wheat no dairy , but label bar states there may trace amounts dairy . i guess they either knew there might very small amount dairy or they hedging themselves because possible cross-contamination some other process . either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts dairy makes this acceptable product . label also states there may traces peanuts . this bar also contains 20% daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots water good idea when eating this bar . there also lots vitamins trace elements , which may good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , which case you may need consider whether you getting too much good thing . clif bars could casual snack , but ingredients their marketing really suggest they geared toward individuals looking healthy energy boost high energy activities . if you fall into category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could good way packing big punch small package . enjoy !	1

perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , most my 30s , i now post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne began age 36 . my skin far too delicate sensitive tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds reviews advice testing it 2 weeks , i found it works well , some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising surface , becoming hideous scab , etc . ) fraction normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated directed zeno , or it disappears completely without ever risen surface ( after week or so ) , when treated very aggressively zeno . my advice : don't expect it work after 1-3 treatments 24 hours advertised . know diligence patience , it work . very aggressive . double-cycles ( allow zeno remain your skin after it beeps , then press button second cycle ) every few hours long bump detectable any way . you may get very slight burning your skin ( causing whitish film or slight peeling ) you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it worth it avoid horrible months-long process cystic acne . i am using this conjunction very thorough natural skincare regime improved nutrition , seeing results i hoped after 2 weeks	1
oral eb417 dual head power brush replacement great job getting into tight places , reaching back teeth , removing plaque , nice gum massage action , leaves your mouth teeth feeling clean very refreshed . two heads work twice good one , but may take some getting used if your used single brush head . using it gently guiding it over your teeth , letting it all work , it last long time too . it nearly three months before i replace mine . most oral brushes interchangeable all oral units . this one though , according buying info here , may not used cross action brush . it also indicate when it time replacement fading colors bristles .

previously owned battery powered travel razors , i always disappointed their power battery life . after all , what point ditching heavier charger razor if you carry load extra batteries still end up stubbly faced ? braun 370-bk pleasant surprise , however ; powerful enough hack through my hiking stubble plenty juice extended outing . i also liked folding design which protects cutting surfaces keeps cleaning brush getting lost . great piece tech good price	1
it working well , little slow warm up . but actually i wanted hot air brush , not this , because i very short hair , but i mistaken when i ordered hot brush instead hot air brush	1
this would great item except it isn't clear it only works handles pointing right . our doors handles going left leaving this item useless us	1
great compact design . takes up very little room your suitcase . rollers heat up ready use 2-3 minutes like product claims . sets hair better then most rollers ( i tried many ) . only thing i would change , add 2-4 more rollers . but i liked these rollers so much , i actually bought 2nd set use these home over 5 other sets rollers i own !	1
i ordered one these my girlfriend she loves it . friends family tried it thrilled . this product make holiday shopping easy several women my list	1

these helpful item me ; cloth pockets nice , instructions microwaving clear simple	1
stuff seem somewhat pricy ( specially college budget ) but it well worth it . taste isn't much talk ; you're better just holding your nose chugging it once . then again , weightlifters don't eat supplements taste they ? i huge energy problem , i lack it lot . class work , i'm usually drained end day , but this stuff helps me get into gym hit it hard . this isn't say it won't requre motivation your part , but it sure helps . during workout , you may notice increase your pump . my muscles felt so tight big , i just wanted lift more more . time i , i went lockeroom change saw monster mirror . i've great pumps before , but this insane ! it didn't even look like me all ; it felt great . i've using it 2 months now i don't train day without it . highly , highly recommended	1
this nature made product excellent . however , readers should aware this products not contain iron very good reason . taking iron supplements sets you up potential health problems if you woman over 50 . i hope other reviewer takes note this .	1
best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty antioxidants , contains good amount protein . only down side high amount carbs , especially sugars , but i still give it five stars	1
i absolutely love this stuff . i would recommend this any person frizz . it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe . i started using it 2 months ago cannot stand go without it . just use little because it make your hair look oily if you use too much don't put it close scalp either same reason . i tried chi silk infusion because i thought they would same since they both made farouk but chi not nearly good . i would give this 100 stars i could .	1

i pumped exclusively my first child no need disposable pads b/c washable ones sufficient . my second child , i both i found these best b/c washable ones not enough . they large so won't shift when you roll bed . they very absorbent though i woken up couple times trenched . they very thin discreet . other pads not big so not enough overage . i never bother adhesives b/c they don't work . they must nursing moms pumping moms first few month when you lots milk . i just wished they softer less paper like	1

i really like this sanitizer . only reason i not give it 5 stars because i wish it bigger so i could fit bottles things slightly larger it . but , i put her pacifiers bottle nipples there .	1
works great but i wish i could find it stores . one riteaid carry it , doesn't always it stock . i also not always find it just any rite aid . some don't carry it all ... annoying ! my daughter canker sore sufferer . i some research before i discovered rembrandt , found ingredient , sodium lauryl sulfate , found almost all toothepastes culprate . rembrandt canker sores not contain this key ingredient . sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) what makes our toothepaste foam . my daughter hardly ever anymore canker sore breakouts . if she , it seems getting cold . try find toothpaste without sls ... they aren't out there . it would nice some competition bring price down more readily available . but all all , i'm glad someone made this product available , even if it pricey hard find .	1

although compartments seem small , you fit lots food into this bowl . it divided into 4 or 5 sections , so you separate your veggies , meat , etc . only thing bummed me out ice pack - frozen gel expanded inside caused container break :( so , i use it store food fridge . i all other fit fresh containers none ice packs those broken .	1

i'm usually very skeptical person i don't trust too many things say they help you this or short amount time . but these vitamins actually work . it takes some time they pretty expensive but they work . so if you need something help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they work show results . only thing i hate product price . but if you money want help growing your hair then you're luck . i'm young i don't alot money so i can't buy these vitamins all time . but if you steady cash flow then you're luck they totally help you	1

my arms used get so sore because i'd blow-dry my thick , frizzy , curly hair 1 1/2 hours then go over it again cheapy flat iron wal-mart . after stylist mastercuts use this my hair achieve even better results under half hour , i knew i buy this produc t.t his great price considering most places like trade secret , iron alone cost $129 plus tax , plus chi products $15 up . it great value , it benefits great cause , so why not ? so if you unruly , thick , curly hair- this product you ! just careful because it get really hot- i burned my ear bit . other than some common sense , anyone use it achieve great results . i tried messing it flip out my hair curl it , i've almost got it down	1
dispenser looks good , holds decent volume shampoo , conditioner etc . it simple refill bottles , so far there no leakage . mounting easy , glued onto tiles silicone glue ( included ) . if it broke or we decided replace it , we would probably struggle quite bit get it off tiles . top shelf not cross bar front , so if you mount dispenser under your shower head , hose knock over whatever you might place shelf . little hooks hold disposable razors but not ones larger heads . overall satisfied , good product price	1
it very easy use , turns very quickly , seems quite accurate . i also love there no extras required ( e.g. , ear tip covers ) . kids want their temperature taken	1
great price , good product , escellent service . i buy this supplier again	1
this product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy . ( careful not use too much ! ) it works best if you little time diffuse your hair blow dryer ! not surprisingly , when i use curl conscious many people compliment curls depth it adds my hair :) i wish it would combat frizz little more , but my hair less frizzy when i use it . i guess next thing i'll try bumble bumble frizz fighter	1

start - i miss my hair . last september i cut my hip length hair mid back , then december just shoulders , then again chin january - january through june i trimmed it regularly keep it length . ( i've getting rid henna my hair - i couldn't get it out via any other method tried except " growing out " ) . my hair grows kinda slow now too - it used grow faster , but i suppose everything slows down older you get . my last cut late june - it mid upper neck length - basically little bit longer than chin length cut , then layered . got rid really saturated henna'd hair - so i ready start growing it out . after much digging around online i came across hair 37 all reviews it - both good bad . i gave it shot - got my pills first week july started taking them . last night - maybe it wishful thinking , but i noticed difference hair length - it seemed it'd picked up little length little extra quickly - then my boyfriend commented it later day . he knows i've working go back my natural hair color - there noticeable demarcation line henna natural hair color . last night he looked me said " hey wow - you're hair really grown - i see half inch more roots ! wow - you're hair getting dark ! " i pretty pleased - not bad just 2 weeks vitamins ! i can't wait see how it 2 weeks , come august - if i 1/2 inch add it , i definitely reordering these pills ! but side note , previous reviews my own experience ... it lot pills take - but make sure you keep up them every day . i find taken stage one pill morning afternoon , then dividing up stage 2 pills into 3 doses 2 pills throughout day works very well .	1
this best affordable acne solution ive ever used . i acne my forehead acne started get smaller even acne my cheeks just disappeared next morning . box there sticker said it works faster than proactiv solution its right ! proactiv takes like 2 weeks work but this works over night . only minor thing it when you put overnight acne control lotion , it starts feeling like its harding into mask your face . it feels like its restricing muscle movement your face . its no biggy because it works it washes right off morning when im shower . i cant believe little lotion make such difference . if you looking acne solution affordable price then this exacly what you looking	1

this shaver replaced norelco advantage ( 6 years old ) shaving good but would no longer hold charge more than couple days . i can't honestly say if it shaves close blade because i haven't shaved blade many years . i used foil shavers past ( braun panasonic ) though they might shave closer than rotary cost replace foils nicks you get not worth it . i using this shaver 3 months . during time i charged it only twice including initial charge using it least every other day . first i thought it underpowered because it so quiet but soon found out it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought doing great job . it shaves quick close ( personally i think close blade ) . when you shaving you just rinse it under tap let it dry . it doesn't get any easier than . i cleaned heads once stated instructions easy too . only con i dry sensitive skin not seen any difference 3 comfort settings . use electric shave before shaving i think you agree it shaves close blade without irritation . highly recommended worth price .	1

i write review below review ( one i quotes ) . below reviewer states this 170 watts you need 1875 watts . i nearly fell off my seat ! not only review but how many people recommended it ! first , 100 watts average hair straighter . 170 watts excellent ! 1875 would melt your hair ! i not think it fair this person rated item without knowledge wattage . " this straightener only 170 watts heating power . not very good number ! if you want salon-straight hair you need ceramic straightener 1875 watts ... especially if you thick or very frizzy hair !	1

i wanted cordless shaver because my age ( 49 ) i need my glasses see hairs i'm shaving , doesn't work well shower ! this braun good buy , easy use , works well if you follow directions shave slowly . it not close or smooth blade shaving gel , but it quicker less mess , so i think it good trade-off .	1
most reviewers this site unenthusiastic this particular product . i think main reason level dissatisfaction , someone else suggested , people need pay attention how , exactly , this trimmer works . because its design , best results obtained when it inserted , withdrawn , then inserted again , procedure repeated . second tip : rinse rotating blade , switched , under hot tap remove accumulated hair , etc , after each use . it works better when clean . main plus this product its size . yes , it flimsy , made china , would probably sell $2.50 if it didn't say panasonic it - or come 12-month panasonic warranty . but it works very well if you use it right keep it clean . i mine couple years only problem blade now dull replacement blades apparently not available	1

this contains 16 servings , which means it last you half month . that pretty expensive when you break price down serving whne compared 1 month supply flax capsules costs $7 . however , liquid flax oil lot more concentrated than pills you buy store . flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg flaxseed oil suggested dosage 2-3 times day . so pills you're getting 2-3g flax oil day . liquid flax oil , you're getting 14g flax . if you buying this it purported treatment acne , sunburn , diverticular disorders , hemorrhoids , more serious health conerns , it probably best consume liquid flax oil . if you just want benefits lower cholesterol heart disease prevention , pill few times day , combined fish oil should all you need . it definitely easier though take spoonful this morning than 3 flax pills day , when you loook value , you're getting 224g flax oil this bottle when compared typical 100g 100 pill bottle capsules . it all depends what you need it	1
i'm black male everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin ingrown hairs . first i'd feel little itch throughout day end day i'd see these tiny little bumps white heads ( 10-20 them ) . before . now after i apply product i don't itch nor tiny bumps come up anymore . it just feels like i never any hair my face first place . only bad thing this product it burns slightly but i don't really care i mean it not like product claims painless .	1

used this product myself many years when particapating ultra endurance cycling events , well my family when vacationing tropical area where sun cook you quickly without adequate sun protection . not fooled thinking you not get tanned using spf 45 or better . misconception ... why not walk away your experience sun without discomfort sun poisoning . found best result when put indoors prior sun .	1
i cannot say how well this product really compares other sunscreens terms sun protection . but it right ingredients most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use , so it should least par them . where this product really shines ( or doesn't shine ) people combination/oily skin . i tried many sunscreens , it so hard find sunscreen without moisturizers ( if you oily skin , that already your natural moisturizers ) . i even tried other neutrogena sunscreens supposed oil free all . result my face ? after applying it , i always shine ( which not what i want ) . this magnificent product , however , actually gives my face nice matte finish ... matte feel , too ! it pretty thick cream when you first apply it ( opposed other suncreens or other products feel more like lotion ) , but almost immediately absorbed skin . 30 seconds , there no more greasy/creamy feeling , one minute , if you feel your skin , there nice matte feel . however , this not fault product , after 3 hours ( least me ) , then i feel like matte effect worn off , my oily skin again showing its oily nature . still , far suncreens go , this best i tried my skin , i highly recommend it people combination/oily skin . btw , this review actual product i got , which spf 30 . time i am writing this review , here amazon they also offer spf 45 version , cheaper , too ! i don't know difference , but i always go lower one ( this case , spf 30 ) , because i theorize -- rightly or wrongly , i don't know -- lesser spf , lesser strength ingredients , so maybe it better sensitive skin (?)	1

i'm writing correct few factual errors other reviews . one reviewer claimed soldier fuel contains no energy ingredients . this untrue . soldier fuel formulated military labs specifically provide steady energy troops . carbohydrates body primary source energy . soldier fuel contains 29 complex carbs ( carbs give long-lasting energy ) 12 sugar . u.s. military labs deemed this perfect ratio give you both quick burst energy no crash . most other energy drinks market lots sugar caffeine . since caffeine stimulant not source energy , result quick spike energy followed crash . error soldier fuel more sugar . it less . one 12 oz . soldier fuel 12 sugar . same amount gatorade contains 21 sugar . same amount red bull 39g sugar . finally , support troops not marketing hype . our company partnered u.s. military natick soldier center . portion gross proceeds each hooah ! soldier fuel each hooah ! bar directly funds research improves safety , diet , quality life our troops	1

this fourth braun shaver i owned , this clearly best . yes , it bit expensive , but you use it everyday my last shaver braun lasted over six years survived year long deployments afghanistan iraq 130 degree temperatures . this shaver quietest i've used cuts my beard less than three minutes . cleaning system much better than last system shaver always stays fresh clean . i am not sure message display necessary , but it tell you how long it took shave each time tells you how much battery charge left . 8975 model probably just good top line 8995 model , but i liked idea larger message center knowing how much charge left . gillette blade very nice cuts through my thick beard like butter . i am very satisfied this shaver purchase other braun shavers future	1
many years i couldn't use electric shaver because it always incomplete shave , so after each christmas when i received new one i would try it would go back manual razor , then came freeglider yippy it reasonable job i would call satisfactory , over years razor went obsolete so i started look new replacement . i read some reviews . i read " refills costly ... hello ... 4$ month ?, then i read doesn't good job , well let me report you all this best darn razor , its like magic each time i use it(cleans itself each time " its quick , comfortable , quiet , cleaning process so cool i one love concept clean razor each time i use it , this razor 10 times better then freeglider which i loved , what joy shaving now , i even shave twice ( i go work sometimes 3am then later night if i'm going out i shave again it doesn't irritate .. what magical razor they designed .. ps . cleaning solution not expensive ( under 12$ 3ea , that 4$ apiece lasts month ) . thank you designer i highly recommend this 2 thumbs upconsnone i see yet .. john	1
i never heard this stuff before , but i decided order some anyhow due single serve packages me constantly run . i am now huge fan product . it works incredibly well convenience life saver gargle . i am not sure why nobody thought this before . it tastes great well . i must say ... it hard find stores , but i jsut keep buying amazon needed since they generally pretty low prices this type product . love naturals !!	1

i practiced deep breathing relaxtion techniques many years , thought i able control my heart rate blood pressure . my last visit my dr told me otherwise . even after deep breathing exercises my diastolic still little high . after using wd few days i realized my deep breathing techniques i practicing all wrong . wds help i am able truly relax lower my stress bp . if you buy this treat it like you would regular computer game same expectations achievement getting next level , you very disappointed . however , if you use wd way achieve true relaxation quicker than you thought possible , then you love it just i . using wd i am able relax quicker every use . i finished game two weeks , but still revisit relaxation exercises almost every night . just ordered next installment " wisdom quest " , can't wait learn new techniques . if you buy journey wild divine , give it honest trial i am sure you not disappointed	1
i finally received this product mail after knowing it year . i can't say i'm huge fan deepak chopra . he presents some good ideas , but what i tell he seems consider meditation more mechanism mind body control , leading bliss relaxation , rather than tool unbiased self knowledge , come terms all things one rather might ignore . i find this bias reflected game . game itself , it pretty good - its graphics its originality - learning relax chill out may useful some people . i didn't find process compelling i expected , though . i found i able learn some skills pretty fast , other places i seemed get stuck . one potential drawback if you get frustrated , try start forcing things happen , it defeat purpose meditation . science biofeedback fairly new , i see its potential field preventative health . i just wouldn't put same new age spin things chopra .	1

this review oral-b flexisoft replacement heads . coupled braun electric toothbrushes , this one most effective aids oral hygiene ever developed . my introduction oral-b goes back over 27 years usaf basic training briefing ; dental technician held up oral-b toothbrush medium bristles said " this toothbrush you need if you want keep your teeth " or some such statement like . well , i haven't lost one yet . motorized mechanicals toothbrush most work while you guide oscillating round head around over your pearly whites . while heads undeniably pricey when looked just dollars cents , there value fact total package actually makes rather mundane chore little more fun while actually living up claim it better job your teeth than manual brushing . since i've always believed entire surface area toothbrush head meant covered toothpaste size head these smaller than average brush , i know i'm using less toothpaste same job . while this no big deal , long term economic benefit plaque under control , healthy gums bright smile full natural teeth . it kind hard deny it works since my dentist confirmed positive results upon direct examination . just careful what model these brush heads you selecting watch pricing . oral-b uses kind color code bristles , ones colored indicator bristles line shaft flexisoft model seems equate medium hardness . enjoy life	1
i love these because they're delicious just thing getting me through long workout . they're also perfect traveling , easy pack , sustain you during all day hike or touristy walkabout . friend mine iraq says he eats them twice day , taste , also because -- i agree -- he trusts energy product designed military soldiers much more than energy product designed private company profit	1
i used this toothbrush 2 months now , so while i cannot really comment subjects like longevity or reliability , i say it functions perfectly . firstly , it cleans teeth gums so much better than manual toothbrushes , or my one previous electric ( bausch lomb interplak ) . experiment i tried you duplicate ( if you any interest ): eat " problem " food usually leaves bits stuck your teeth . me , this means blueberries ( skins ) or tuna . brush your manual brush . then rinse spit several times , until no more debris coming out . now floss throughly then rinse spit several times again . how much more debris you get now ? this what your toothbrush not get . now try it again oral . oral brush , my mouth feels much cleaner , i end up much less food left floss get . i chose 7550 because i wanted oral " 3d brushing action " mechanism lowest price , when i looked various models sale , it seemed major difference them ( not just gimmicks ) number types brush heads included each model . i figured since these expendables , i would buying more them over years anyway . end , 7550 four brush heads included 6 refills i bought same time cost less than some fancier models fewer heads . build-quality seems first-rate , action combines oscillation in-and-out pulsations very effective , my teeth thanking me	1
this nice easy use toothbrush . lots power holds charge pretty good . best way use let battery drain down before recharging . after maybe five days use , twice day , you feel battery need recharged maximum power . i like fact it only two-minute timer not turn off after two minutes . i don't need toothbrush too many bells whistles . only annoying thing some would blue recharge indicator light stays while charging . i use like night light those middle night bathroom excursions . no more blinded turning light	1
life good batteries work way they supposed work . good value	1
once , i don't " public service " going clifbar.com looking up ingredients nutritional information ; amazon.com it all top product page . now , i focus taste!that good thing , because this ( clif z-bar , chocolate ) one better tasting " nutritional " snacks its kind . it just enough chocolate ( brought you chocolate chips ( which include organic cane juice , unsweetened chocolate , cocoa butter , unspecified " natural flavors " ) actually impart chocolate flavor . not heavy or rich chocolate flavor , but unmistakable one : you don't close your eyes , convince yourself it chocolate . ( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1
best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty antioxidants , contains good amount protein . only down side high amount carbs , especially sugars , but i still give it five stars	1
i eat one these twice week before i play ice hockey . i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine , though i don't perceive any " boost " . it could there i'm just not noticing it . i feel they job keeping me fueled workout . it would nice if package made specific recommendation how long before workout eat clif bar . i find size clif bar bit disappointing , especially considering " store " price $1.50 . $11 case free shipping when spending $25 or more , i've not found better price than amazon clif bars	1
after trying many pre-shaving products i found this best one . only problem it hard find , when i i usually buy several	1

these bars so delicious , you worried they're just candy bars . but they're not ! they packed energy nutrition keep you going keep you healthy too . flavor variety unmatched market . peanut butter chocolate chip peanutbutter my favorites , but oatmeal raisin walnut also excellent , especially if you hiking canteen water go their very natural deliciousness	1
if you looking new ways incorporate soy products into your life , clif bars one best tasting energy bars market . i've given up trying other bars mostly disappointingly filled all sorts oils i can't eat . take cottonseed example it everything ! not mention , peanut butter all palm kernel oil saturating health bar market . ingredients carrot cake bar : organic brown rice syrup , soy protein isolate , rice flour , malt extract , organic soy flour , organic roasted soybeans , organic rolled oats , organic evaporated cane juice , organic dried apples , cocoa butter , soy lecithin , natural flavors , apple fiber , oat fiber , organic milled flaxseed , chicory extract , psyllium , organic soy butter , dried carrots , raisins , coconut , sea salt , nutmeg , cinnamon cloves . each bar 240 calories delicious breakfast cup tea . i eat clif bar almost every morning never really feel overly hungry during day . gary ( owner clif bar inc . ) seems also found out " other " energy bars not really tasty . after his " epiphany , " he spent lots time his mom kitchen working making cliff bars . what guy ! i point where i trying make my own granola bars , but after discovering these bars , i'm hooked . they portable , delicious basically , i love all flavors . you take them biking , hiking , walking , anywhere . this bar especially delicious i seem fall love it again each october . must spices creamy white chocolate chips . there just enough chocolate chips remind you cream cheese icing . if i choose piece carrot cake one these bars , bar would win . also look cranberry apple cherry bars pumpkin spice bars . ~ therebeccareview.com	1
if you burn lots calories your activities , this high energy food could give you lift . there 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which advertised least 70% organic . this bar advertised athletes first , casual snack second . if you overweight trying drop pounds , you skip this snack move back unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed it looks like compressed goop . however , compressed goop tastes pretty good . texture much like granola bar , though more moist than granola bar . black cherry part black cherry almond understated . there dried cherries this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which big plus . i unable find anything this bar implied it artificial , which even bigger plus . one thing confused me little bar advertised no wheat no dairy , but label bar states there may trace amounts dairy . i guess they either knew there might very small amount dairy or they hedging themselves because possible cross-contamination some other process . either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts dairy makes this acceptable product . label also states there may traces peanuts . this bar also contains 20% daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots water good idea when eating this bar . there also lots vitamins trace elements , which may good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , which case you may need consider whether you getting too much good thing . clif bars could casual snack , but ingredients their marketing really suggest they geared toward individuals looking healthy energy boost high energy activities . if you fall into category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could good way packing big punch small package . enjoy !	1

scale indeed looks very nice sleek its glass design . quality seems quite nice , it designed england . there 10 year warranty case anything goes wrong . scale very accurate , but i agree others tapping issue . i more like " hit " it my foot get it started . make sure you wait until 18888 turns 0 before stepping . 18888 means it calibrating scale 0 . you keep very still weight stabilize . or else it just keep going up down , although you'll able get your weight within half pound before number stabilizes	1
while i'm big fan hooah bars , this particular flavor tastes like apple jolly ranchers . no kidding . if that okay you , then go apple flavor . i'd recommend chocolate	1
when i go out nights i meet lot people . i like centre attention , which means i louder more fun than dj , music , flashing lights everyone else places i go . its lot fun but drains my energy . i often find myself crashing half way through night . i run out steam , feeling hungry , dizzy ( worst all ) i loose my spark . only thing then leave grab bite eat . typically i feel bloated sleepy then . so i'll often call it night . fun over - which sucks ! i needed different way things . i experimented candy bars , oatmeal bars energy bars . none them worked - they just delayed crash little . hooah bar last one i tried . i say it last one , because once i tried this i realised i didn't need anything else . i tried it out my birthday . i admit whole " developped military " thing made me curious . but after failing all other bars i didn't high hopes . i took two bars me night . around midnight familiar signs i depleted my energy stores started showing : i felt little dizzy , i got few hot cold flushes , my stomach felt like it going eat itself soon . thing i far too good time leave ( i party 7 people hanging my every word - something which tremendous things boosting old ego ! ) instead bailing - i might , i just popped open hooah bar ate it i carried . within minutes my hunger pangs disappeared , my blood sugar levels balanced out i felt back form . best thing i didn't feel bloated or tired afterwards . it exactly what i needed . i know i taking hooah bar me every time i go out now	1
i encountered these last week carlsbad triathlon . they tasted really good i figured if it good enough military , i'll give it try ... sure enough , military knows what it doing -- it seems work claimed . thumbs up , or , hooah	1
while i am not sure what exactly these taste like , i don't detect peanut butter here . texture good , chewy enough , but taste ... odd . not all sweet . i can't imagine any child ( or adult ) grown accustomed high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these . bleh . if you want peanut butter , clif bar much better flavor ( even denser , chewier texture ) . if you want z-bar , i slightly recommend chocolate -- although it too tastes bit odd inferior chocolate clif bars . builder bars also worth try , sufficiently sweet flavorful . course , these alternative product lines you get twice calories . although i not buy these again , i give company star worthy effort	1
clif bars great- my only concern it seems like there lot more packaging then necessary product shipped . thanks .	1
my beard hairs extremely curly i struggled ingrown hairs razor bumps ever since junior high . i never liked way i looked beard i always wanted clean shaven , but my curly hair didn't allow me shave more than once week or so . if i shaved more often , ingrowns bumps would go out control . it , only shaving once week still gave me huge problems . i resigned myself always looking scruffy . until i found this shaver . instead cutting hair beneath skin level ( where it cause bumps since it curl grown beneath skin ) , this razor cuts hairs just above skin . what this mean me ? first time 14 years , i am able shave whenever i want . my ingrowns completely disappeared . i feel like new person i love looking clean-cut . thank you remington	1
outstanding quality , consistency accuracy ! end day all you ask blood pressure cuff ( sphygmomanometer ) . few things bear mind : consecutive readings same time , you see trend higher lower blood pressure you " learn " lower your own pressure . also , your blood pressure home lower than you obtain your doctor office until you learn overcome anxiety normally associated doctor office . this normal one main reasons obtain home blood pressure monitor . also , your pressure fluctuate day day even during blood pressure monitoring session . so don't automatically assume gauge not giving accurate readings ! trust me , it . this monitor extensively tested against measurements obtained doctor office determined accurate method determining blood pressure you would obtain doctor office - actually , more accurate since anxiety factor eliminated . so if you looking best home blood monitor device market look no further . just made sure trust it ! i heartily endorse this product	1

i very dissapointed my purchase , citrus taste water absolutely terrible i just could not drink it , so there whole case sitting unused my porch . waste money	-1
i think this product very good . once you've glanced user manual it easy use . you store several profiles it so every member your family quickly use it . only thing i wish it would it doesn't save previous results . this very handy tool keeping track your weight loss progress . you'll idea how your body composition chaning your weight	1
this well-made device useful , though limited , value . it usefulness derives its consistency , which amazing . given your body composition varies throughout day , particularly your level hydration , omron measurements vary only fractions percent - exactly what you would expect . it measures small electric currents running one electrode , through your body , second electrode . omron programmed estimate your body fat measuring impedance your body flow electricity . so , one might think such measurement would straightforward , like weight scale . electricity encounters fat , muscle , bone , fluids omron interprets current displays your body fat percent . right ? after all , when you step scale , scale responds showing your weight . you don't need tell scale whether you think you athlete or how old you . it simply measures your weight . well , omron doesn't work way , nor other similar devices , nor skin-fold calipers . it looks me though electrical skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat . then they require you input other data , such your activity level ( " normal " or " athlete " omron case ) age . this not good because it introduces general population averages into what should specific measurements you . instance , regardless your body , it assumed older you , more internal fat you . resulting body fat estimates dramatically different when factoring those variables . omron ( calipers ) still useful , though , if you consider it compass rather than scale . you can't sure it tell you where you , but , over time , it tell you where you going .	1
i've using omron hbf-306 body fat analyzer month or so now . so far i've very impressed its consistency . however , i would go doctor get some sort analysis compare omron measurements see how accurate it . it well built very easy use . once you set up your profile , it only takes few seconds get read . i would give it 5 stars but again i dont yet anything compare its measurements . still good product good price .	1
i bought this gadget intent monitoring my daily steps get idea where i currently establish some sort baseline so i could get reality check my activity levels . i opened box , read easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off distance your 10 steps ) , clipped it my pants forgot it day . i surprised find out corpse could probably move around more during day than me ! over next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track 7 days steps you ); i literally stepped up my game went 756 steps no aerobic exercise day 1 , 7,880 steps 30 minutes nonstop aerobic exercise day 3 ! every day getting easier achieve 10,000 " normal " steps , increasing aerobic steps too ( which tracked separately ) . i press mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , compare it past 7 days well . it turned out even more fun than what i originally bought it . i actually feel better , fun part i am trying beat my own personal record previous day ! this eye-opening experience me , i keep this or my pocket all time now , just make sure i keep mindful eye my steps aerobic activity day	1
this pedometer accurate you could reasonably expect . features suitable it even looks good . only problem i this product minor , it why i gave item 4 stars , rather than 5 . plastic holder/belt clip comes pedometer cheaply made very puny little spring . if you don't plan using belt clip , this definitely 5 star item . otherwise , just treat holder gently hopefully it last longer than mine , because omron won't sell holder seperately . holder only weakness speak if omron redesigns it , this 5 stars across board ( record , i wouldn't let my opinion holder stop me buying one . i'd make same suggestion anyone who fence - buy it .	1
mother two children , one special needs this product must . it allows me easily keep track all medical events . it particularly useful when visiting doctor first time i easily provide summary my child medical history . no more guessing ! when my children grown they record their medical history . this particulary useful child complex medical history . it very user friendly tool . i highly recommend this product .	1

i used this toothbrush 2 months now , so while i cannot really comment subjects like longevity or reliability , i say it functions perfectly . firstly , it cleans teeth gums so much better than manual toothbrushes , or my one previous electric ( bausch lomb interplak ) . experiment i tried you duplicate ( if you any interest ): eat " problem " food usually leaves bits stuck your teeth . me , this means blueberries ( skins ) or tuna . brush your manual brush . then rinse spit several times , until no more debris coming out . now floss throughly then rinse spit several times again . how much more debris you get now ? this what your toothbrush not get . now try it again oral . oral brush , my mouth feels much cleaner , i end up much less food left floss get . i chose 7550 because i wanted oral " 3d brushing action " mechanism lowest price , when i looked various models sale , it seemed major difference them ( not just gimmicks ) number types brush heads included each model . i figured since these expendables , i would buying more them over years anyway . end , 7550 four brush heads included 6 refills i bought same time cost less than some fancier models fewer heads . build-quality seems first-rate , action combines oscillation in-and-out pulsations very effective , my teeth thanking me	1
this nice easy use toothbrush . lots power holds charge pretty good . best way use let battery drain down before recharging . after maybe five days use , twice day , you feel battery need recharged maximum power . i like fact it only two-minute timer not turn off after two minutes . i don't need toothbrush too many bells whistles . only annoying thing some would blue recharge indicator light stays while charging . i use like night light those middle night bathroom excursions . no more blinded turning light	1
this got one easiest blood pressure monitors use . it really doesn't start until your arm correct position , letting you know beeping when you've got it right . display large easy read understand . i definitely would recommend this	1
i compared this body fat monitor similar ones tanita . you definately getting more your money here . it stores up 4 users where tanita models only store 2 compares function function elsewhere lower price point . not mention this scale just feels like better quality when you pick it up . i bought one one omron pedometers take advantage instant rebate amazon . ( i haven't seen event tanita amazon while . ) pedometer #1 rated cr . they both top notch products	1
this blood pressure monitor everything i looking price certainly right . thank you . it works perfectly	1
i'm cursed sensitive skin tough beard . i'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i carefully prep shaving . after years trial error , i've finally settled good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser base , then kiss my face moisture shave supplement . post-shave comfort prevent breakouts , i use product like cleanclear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , weak link up until now actual shaver . gillette fusion power , i've finally found right one . i've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during first gulf war ( i marines time ) . they've gotten job , but 3-blade system ultimately inadequate my beard skin type . it doesn't take long blades start cutting my face neck , especially since i take forever change blades . i dreaded looking bathroom mirror work seeing dried blood spots ( not mention getting blood stains my collar ) . electric shavers don't work me either - too hard my skin , i'd five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it shot . i initially skeptical powered aspect due my issues electric shavers . but fusion power happy exception . first i struggled bit getting battery cap off end . but once i mastered maneuver got battery , i set . it takes one aaa-battery seems last decent interval ( low-battery indicator nice touch ) . even if fusion power runs out juice , you still shave it . shaver glides over my face , vibration feels good - kind like pick-me-up morning . five blades really nail my beard , even tough spots like my chin jaw line remain cut-free . i also like one-blade trimmer top - very handy evening out my sideburns zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue expense blades . but i make them last lot longer than old 3-blade razors while still getting great shave . most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i , it more because rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , result worth higher price . gillette fusion power best shaver i've ever tried . highly recommended	1
i use this product my son my wife i just love it . we no buy any othe product but this one . unless we run out without placing order ..... but it easy enough him pull it down then pull it back up when he finished . very convenient	1
price ... you can't beat rayovac . blow away those cheap " heavy duty " batteries last almost or just long premium brands . amazon price seems like it best other than wal-mart ... who priced same or just little lower . well worth spend !	1
clif bars amoung best tasting energy bars i ever tried . they may not pack many calories or grams protein other brands , but there times where i could not even finish competeing bar because dismal taste or texture	1
i've tried many types nutrition bars many too sweet or they not tasty . clif bars get it right	1
i purchased several them it burn free rash free , easy apply you not use your fingers etc apply it , one sticks lasts lasts . it really makes shaving joy , not chore , i just love using it you too . it far best best pre-shave product market	1
i so excited this product ; but when i got it i deeply dissatisfied . box damaged . it bent inward lid one side around drawers opening it ripped both sides . i returning this product replacement . i think box really cute . however if i receive damaged box then i never buy thing this website	-1
cutest keepsake box . flip-top lid which perfectly fits matching record book , two drawers below , one which divided into sections smaller keepsakes . bottom drawer good size store matching photo album too . lid frame you place picture your little one , says " thank heaven little girls " all around frame . excellent value , it very sturdy	1
clif bars make tasty pleasant snack . they perfect when you simply don't lot time get something into you keep you going . [ ... ] they excellent source vitamins . they very chewy satisfying ; you won't need more than one or two before you workout . they much more nutritious than candy bar , too . however , this snack bar not perfect . reviewer notes , there quite bit sugar , carbohydrates fat each bar . this food bar not anyone salt free diet it contains salt ; people allergies any kind nuts should definitely not eat this food . overall , clif nutrition bars useful those us who not allergic any their ingredients who want healthier alternative candy bar . amazon price makes them affordable i recommend them delicious snack food .	1
i saw this few days ago it source circuit city ... definitley worth money ! it repairs scratches saved all dvds i used it . so there no other repair kit ... buy it today , if you see it	1
very good protein bar . cookies cream very tasty , yet it not too sweet . i find builder bar one big advantage over regular clif bar ( other than protein course ): builder bar isn't super sweet . i really enjoy regular clif bar but sometimes it leaves me feeling like i just ate really sweet candy bar . builder bar doesn't suffer . downside builder bar , however , it bit saturated fat . sum , not bad bar much tastier than many other protein bars i tried	1
i bought these because i love regular clif bars . i ride my bike to/from work , so i thought i would use these kind " breakfast replacement " . they taste very good they definitely hold you over until lunch . although , i highly recommend glass cold milk handy wash it down	1
i'm giving this ' 4 ' because my husband likes them took them me use after his weight lifting work-outs . but i tried one first : outside chocolate bit crumbly probably due shipping storage . taste fair real good high protein bar doesn't use lot sugar alcohols sweeten it , depending your taste such things . other words it not super-sweet but sucralose ( splenda ) gets job , if i remember correctly . it super keeping you getting hungry due fact it real carbs , not play carbs it , match it high amount protein - probably could used zone diet . you last hours hours it . it more than meal . ( this not dieter bar , although careful planning could used such . ) we've tried lot bars this best high protein bar yet doesn't rely sugar alcohols ( otherwise , stick south beach diet bars .	1
graet consumers who want get more protein their diets without sacrifice benefits all-natural ingredients or great taste . truly works	1

i purchased this towel gym use after older microfiber towel finally wore out after several years , after couple months use , it very good purchase . it doesn't same loops one used regular terry-cloth towels , but it very , very soft absorbant , since first time i used it . ( cleaning instructions say not use fabric softener , i don't . ) it dries very quickly , so it ideal gym use . unlike cotton towels , it doesn't get nasty odor sometimes happens . size extremely generous , but it also fits easily gym bag when folded . one probably wouldn't want use it home place regular terry-cloth towels , but you certainly could . it would also make good purchase college students dorms , since it dries quickly , even when hanging	1

it good thing , step up previous mopping systems . it could if i understood all features better i would get better results . if it came booklet explaining it , then my wife must put someplace weird because i never saw it . i never would thought mop would require instruction booklet , but it . really bad stains still scrubbed hands knees style , which i hoped this would eliminate . i like it though . maybe couple years there something further evolved these lines really best i imagine .	1

i've through 4 or 5 portable oral irrigators past ten years . first ones i bought panasonic quite weak ceased work within year or so - changing batteries didn't help ! so i discarded them went hand pump kind , but when broke i went back panasonic - this model works better than their original model . pulse stronger , it easy fill , hasn't died me yet . so i'm hopeful it'll last more than year !	1
after 3 months daily use , this nifty little device keeps pumping ! my wife wouldn't let me take over tiny bathroom counter traditional counter-top style water irrigator . addition space , dangling cord would pain . this portable panasonic device tucks into my medicine cabinet . it takes 10 seconds get ready it works well counter-top device . yeah , okay , you change batteries once month . no big deal . it small portable it works . highly recommended !	1

i lingering cold / sore throat symptoms once couple years ago i bought these healthy food store try them out . turns out they just best lozenges i've ever tried . they work exceptionally , taste great last long time . very soothingto honest , i don't like effervescent " airborne " . it too inconvenient use too expensive . too bad store i went stopped carrying these lozenges , because i won't buy fizzy kind . really glad i found them amazon , even shipping they're good deal . buy 4 boxes , you'll need them they last least year so no worries if you think they'll go bad . if you're teacher or kids trust me you'll need them even more . only drawback i found these foil packaging inside isn't resealable , though you fold it over they stay almost fresh . lozenges assorted fruit , but packages i got almost all ' grape ' inside . i would prefer more cherry , orange , lemon . but other than , these rock . they don't sell these target , despite what you read other reviews . buy them	1
if it would possible give this product 0 or even below zero stars , i would . i tried shorten my beard trimmer today only thing it pluck out some hair stop when more there more than 4 hairs cut once . i not even try battery powered second option , because those usually worse than ones outlet . anyway , i would never buy this product , because even $19 too much this	-1
well i don't think there really much you say clipper set , there ? i'm loyal wahls this good deal . it shaves pretty well though i find i go back over areas time or two make sure i get it all same length . i think it may way guard not fault clipper itself . i've it maybe month now it kept up well four or so times i've shaved my head since . little trimmer comes it pretty nice powerful running aa batteries . it trimmed down my facial hair cleaned up my neck very fast when my old trimmer took some pressing few passes . i only two minor complaints actual product itself . it gets really warm after 10-15 minutes . normally this might not big deal but if you big head like i make sure you get it all properly it start get too hot want use . other thing it isn't too great no guard shaving . now granted i only tried it once but it wasn't catching everything when i try . it could i just holding it wrong angle get it , which easy mirror , but i thought it worth noting just incase . i think it may need guards guide hair better . also , something kind odd nasty , amazon sent me open used one . now $15 i wasn't going bother returning it or complaining . i just cleaned it off some alcohol wipes got rid left over hair(yuck ! ) it good go but it really worth stating because i think i would got something else if i'd known i would get used one	1

i really didn't think this thing going work ... but when you acne most your life you try anything any cost . i found using zeno conjunction proactive solution i cleared my face significantly acne . zeno product take some time use , you hold it pimple approx . two minutes . it causes redness area 10 minutes only mildly uncomfortable when you first put it pimple . after day or two acne gone . it weird , but it works ! i only gave it 4 stars because two minutes you hold it your face , redness , mild discomfort heat . other than , it quite easy use requires no clean up . you just charge it periodically after 90 uses you replace tip . replacing it so simple . you literally just pull old one off snap new one . this very simple device it trick . it not work very well all cystic ance , but basic zits or pimples it takes care them day or two .	1

i just received my itouchless 22gal trashcan . there huge dent side above where bottom shipping styrofoam ended . i able pop dent back out turn it so it faces cabinet so hopefully nobody see two small dimples remain . i tried 33gallon trashbag which seems nice fit - ample extra room . there inner ring which holds trashbag place so even if you put small bag won't reach bottom , it looks like you should covered - least up like 10-20lbs probably . aut o-o pen mechanism works great , just put your trashcan spot away passing traffic or you probably wear your ( 4 d-type ) batteries out quickly . it makes bit gear noise when it opens closes but not too bad . i surprised it offered ac adapter , great . i wish there option when i ordered it add one my order , would even better . i probably head out radioshack pick up one those universal adapters - no problem . other thing think would using rechargeable batteries well . i mention it huge ? i guess i didn't really understand how big 22gal trashcan going . it like tall counters kitchen probably 12-15 " diameter . i think if you took large pizza box folded it half , this thing would swallow it - no problem	1

i must say i skeptical this , but low price versus department store cosmetics , figured it worth try . amazingly , it really works quite well my wife loves it ! after few weeks , people commenting she looked less tired , asked if she lost weight , exercising or vacation . since it works gradually over few weeks , you notice bit difference yourself , but people who don't see you often really notice dramatic change . smaller wrinkles smoothed out disappear completely , while large ones get smaller . it won't make 69 year old look 20 , but definitely takes off decade wear tear	1

like all wrist monitors , it must used carefully get accurate reading . it also tends read few points below arm cuff when used directed . like all wrist cuffs , it supposed held heart , or armpit level . however , me , gives consistently lower reading than arm cuff ... few points . compensate i hold it lower down , 8 12 inches . then it consistent arm cuffs i also use . it also tends deflate bit more quickly than i think good best accuracy . big flaw , one it shares prevention ds-1902pv arm cuff , while it claims detect irreglar heartbeat , , it not store info memory bp pulse , time date . if info useful detect then it should useful record , what i assumed it would . i think bit misrepresentation product . i am also not happy way information must displayed copying . it cumbersome system , if you not quick enough display defaults then record , say number 24 , must found again , requiring 24 button presses . otherwise it what it claims , very handy portable unit	1
if you buy them individually , they less than $1 . i know it seems silly , but i absolutely loe these nail clippers . they fit my hand well , they stayed sharp enought cut not pull long time , they tiny enought littlest nails . even if you don't get this whole kit , buy safest 1st nail clippers	1
i used everything this so far , except tooth brush my son only two months old . after i use nail clippers i file his nails so he wil not get this face . sug , clip babies nails while he sleeping	1
these scales work good unless you take diurectic regularly . if so , it won't able give you fat water content	1

these glass fantastic ! when you doing close work using both hands , you never re-position glasses because they've moved or started slide off your nose . i wear tri-focals i need use very lower part my glasses close work . there never enough " close magnification " or " focal position " raised high enough me look straight or upward through these lenses adequately see . clic solved my problem ! they adjustable , durable , comfortable , very cool looking , everyone calls them my " csi " glasses , they all want them . definitely great purchase all way around . i highly recommend them plan purchase additional clics	1
these readers opened new world me ....... real conversation piece . previous reviews stated , you don't lose your glasses . my glasses arrived time take me vacation . but i disappointed pictures taken me ..... hair around above my ears stuck out . consequently , i ceased using them until i my hair trimmed again . otherwise , i very pleased them .	1
these great scales . they very helpful our family four tracking our weight body fat . hydration nice too . i would definitely recommend these anyone ! unlike many scales , you get this twice row get exact same reading . very accurate!it nice see how many calories you eat each day maintain your weight .	1
excellent choice office use . i would suggest this pen everyone who looking buy quality writing device office use	1
i surveyed prices felt this good price quality product .	1
i purchased this unit replace 12 year old waterpic . this unit much quieter it design makes it much easier clean store . rounded surfaces reservoir dry easier protects whole unit dust when stored	1
i horrible scales , but so many sayin this one not work , well i am here say they wrong . least me anyhow , it works very efficiently , gives every time i am it accurate clear readings my weight loss , etc . i am goin clearly recommend this great scale , this reasonably low price i say go buy it ! i even called customer service back this conair ww scale , they are/were so friendly helpful how use how set it etc . love it , absolutely no complaints !!! five(5)stars sure ! adios ! [ ... ]	1
good scale nothing bad say it . lite weight which nice	1
i think scale great , except depending where you put your feet weight could off pound or two . some people might their entire week weightloss . so i suggest placing your feet same exact place each time you weight yourself . ( maybe make feet marks ??	1
it ink . what more there say ? it just lot ink reasonable price , if you like black ink , i highly recommend you use this ink your fountain pen . this package contains four glass bottles individual boxes , each bottle capped stout plastic lid seal . those who may wonder if cross ink work mont blanc pen ( hey , don't laugh , i see it legitimate question if someone isn't familiar fountain pens , ) answer -- unless mont blanc pens somehow special -- yes , since all fountain pens just reservoirs finely tuned leaks . quality ink quality company work any them . one thing aware : if you've never used fountain pen before , aware unlike other types ink , fountain pen ink not all waterproof . least , i've never seen waterproof fountain pen ink ; i imagine it clogging pens very effectively . not you should taking your notebook swimming pool , but aware ink run if water touches page it written	1
overall , i'm very happy this product . it adds attractive , modern look my kitchen larger capacity adds convenience not needing change bag every other day . automatic opener mechanism bit too sensitive -- often opens just walking nearby -- but it pretty much works described . i would recommend this product others considering automated trashcan	1
my beard like wire brush shaving like ... well shaving wire brush . thus far i couldn't happier i buy these again	1
great product , i nothing more then great words say this product	1
i've very happy mach iii past few years -- but then fusion razor cartridge came mail i figured i'd give it try . i'm probably good one test razors ... see my photograph -- not only i shave my face , ( though i typically goatee ) , but i also shave my entire head well . i've using same fusion blade now -- daily my face , just every third day my head -- despite some claims contrary , it still going strong ... after almost three weeks !! why my blade lasted this long , despite my pretty heavy usage ? every time i shave , after thoroughly rinsing blade , i give it quick spray shower cleaner . ( such " clean shower " or any no-wipe cleaners you spray after using shower . ) then i set razor so it standing cartridge end down . this two things . shower cleaner ensures no film water remains dry edges blades , leaving spots microscopic rusty areas form , ) standing razor blade-side-down makes sure gravity takes any debris or water might left blade , down away blade edge , since edge blades face up when you cartridge down . prior doing this mach iii blades , i'd also get 3 or 4 good shaves out blade ... but once i tried it , i got many 30 . it makes huge difference ! i should also point out i almost never get nicks cuts . ( i've shaving my head 4 years , i think i've nicked it shaving once ... . part reason because i'm very careful using my blade-cleaning technique . ) note gillette ... send me lifetime supply fusion cartridges i'll consider removing blade-life extending tip this review ! ;-) - jonathan sabi	1
this item not worth money spent it . you not use boiling water steam not last any time all . you better heating water cup microwave breathing steam . you put vicks strips or whatever your cup water . this not good product my books . thanks	-1
how worthless ? let me count ways , unless you child , fit not fit . this not electrical device you only allowed use hot tap water , cup worth , so there no steam . save yourself bit money hot cup tea , it surely produce more steam than this ill-conceived gizmo	-1
price this product lot better than what you find store or salon . very happy my purchase	1

ed600 said " this shaver may last you few months - year , 2 3 years stretch . " well , i disagree . i've using nothing but my remington ms3 2700 every day seven years . i clean unit very quickly after every use purchase replacement foils when necessary ( every 2 years ) . i just bought my second remington ms3 2700 after internal plastic part broke due rigorous cleaning . this unit isn't perfect , but nothing . ( " clean very quickly " i mean i open top let little hairs fall out .	1
i'll keep it short point : this best shaver i've ever used . i thick , heavy beard grows long quickly i sensitive skin . i am recovering surgery needed shaver gave me decent shave without long adjustment period ( because i am unable manipulate blade-type razor ) . this thing absolutely blew me away first time every time i've used it since . i am 42 yrs . old couldn't imagine getting shave like this . it could era i grew up it long time since i've tried electric razor , but this thing great . make sure you follow instructions i'm pretty sure you'll good results . 1 . keep shaver clean lubricated ( it doesn't hurt same your face neck ) . 2 . use trimmer longer beard hairs ( face neck ); pull your skin flat use semi-circular stroke . not press down harder get hairs prove difficult trim or shave ; rather , use method stated previously . , oh yeah : i haven't problem indicator light . i haven't noticed it it doesn't affect functioality . my opinion , this greatest thing since sliced bread	1

i am skeptic nature . someone degree business i expect marketers stretch truth , minimum . i purchased this product thinking if it didn't work it only few dollars . guys work skeptical i until first coffee spill . this little pen even removed coffee stain 4 hours old . we all absolutely amazed ! i used this product following stains it removed them completely : 1 . fresh coffee stain2 . 4 hour old coffee stain3 . balsamic vinegar4 . make up ( foundation)5 . marinara sauce6 . olive oil7 . soy sauceif you or your significant other spill prone , pick one these up right away . i one desk one my purse . i knew tide winner when guys work began purchasing their own tide go pens after using mine . i not recommend this product highly enough . it actually one those products everything it claims .	1

protein bar , vanilla yogurt my favourite energy bar . i eat it after workout or run . it tastes good , it takes time eat ( which good ! ) gives fullness sensation . i particularly like high protein concentration opposed other bars more carbohyrates emphasis . pack 12 lasts me two four weeks good bang buck	1
i am power bar addict i absolutely love this one ... however , vanilla flavor adds ( rather than takes away ... ) typically " cardboard " flavor power bar . oddly enough , this doesn't bother me ! vanilla so sweet ( i am admitted sugar addict ) it really control need snacking . i usually split bar ... one half before my workout one half after . i agree you must water one these bars . it sit like ton bricks your stomach without water . all all , this bar great . i easily get through long day or tough workout one these	1
.... which every 10 or 15 minutes right . i've tried chains , they tangle everything . i tried prescription bifocals , i could not get used them , particularly walking down stairs . i tried prescription pair , framless , light weight , pushed down nose meant worn all time . didn't work me , i'm just not comfortable glasses unless i'm reading . " don't put them chair they'll get bent " -- he right , now they need go back repairs . but they won't because i'm finding these i wear all time . they're around my neck when i need them . adjustable , so if i'm leaning back relaxing against pillow they don't pop out off my nose . i really am love these glasses , short my youthful eyes back this next best solution	1

i've holding out buying new set hot rollers three years , because i couldn't find set i liked : flocked ( means they fuzzy coating grab your hair ) multi-sized , those metal u-shaped clips everyone else seems hate . this set all then some ! it got 8 jumbo-sized rollers , which i hard time finding , plus six 1-1/4 inch rollers six 1-inch size . i fine but thick straight hair varies just below shoulders bra-strap length , this set i either all-large rollers body little wave , or use multiple small rollers lots curl . plus , it came both types clips -- plastic " jaws " kind , u-shaped metal clips . i should say , i bought my set beauty supply store my city , i bought it clearance less than it retails here . nevertheless i feel lucky found it i would paid more . rollers heat very fast hold heat quite while , so i get good tight curl if i let them heat 15 minutes cool 30 . other hand you just get some good body smoothing ten minutes , if you're rush . oh , it on/off switch , so you cut power without unplugging it . this useful if your outlet hard-to-reach place , mine	1

trimspa works great if you take it consistantly . i take 4 6 tablets every day . i start few more per day initially then after few days i cut it back couple . if i take it directed , i discover after 2 days i cannot eat nearly much food without feeling pretty darn full . it isn't i don't ever get hungry its just when i sit down eat , amount i feel full after eating cut half . then i don't feel need eat until next meal . it helps kill snacking overeating me , which makes it great conjunction any type modified eating program you trying stick . it not make me feel jittery or weird . biggest issue just remember take pills 3 times day it tend work little better if you take it hour before each meal . i discovered i cannot lose more than 12 pounds through just dietary changes so i starting adding exercise my program trimspa helping tremendously , because usually when i start working out my appetite goes right up . i believe these great assist any weight loss program you trying stick	1

this my first humidifier ever , so i'm not sure how it compares others , but after reading many reviews other humidifiers , it seems like many humidifiers hit or miss . this one job . it super quiet when it running . only sounds it makes drippity drop water . my only complaint " glug glug glug " sound water it makes maybe every 5 minutes , but it really not loud very tolerable.it great it doesn't any filters change there control dial let you adjust mist . it advertised low power consumption , so that definite plus too . i bought bear shaped one it great it cute , so it not just some random plastic box your room blows off mist . i recommended my friend get one too she loves it well .	1
all low carb bars i've eaten , these one best . little sweet but not too rich . they crispy not dense many others but they still filling . if you not familiar low carb bars , they all seem leave you needing bottle water when finished . these too but not bad most	1
i've other electric toothbrushes before quite liked them , but this hydrabrush far superior any i've ever used before ! i started , suggested literature , extra soft set brushes , after i got knack using this new method , brushed shorter period first few times . explained , gums some bleeding first few times , ( i bleed very easily ) but they not painful bleeding short duration . obviously massaging gums healthy way since so many people develop gum disease this help head off such potentially serious problem . i also like hydrabrush because once it charged , it unplugged placed holder which put anyplace ( one isn't tethered recharge cord ) . so it stored cupboard or any other spot away sink area , just wherever it convenient you . i've used it least 30 times this same first charge ... just turn dial brush it starts right up . i purchased this toothbrush because great feedback when amazon great friday sale , so now i'm complete believer , i'm hoping repeat sale i want get one each my family this time	1
this not ordinary toothbrush . it took me few times adjust how angle it , however it worth initial ackwardness . my teeth never looked or felt cleaner ! half time . what creative concept brushing top , bottom , front , insides teeth same time ! pure genius ... worth every penny more.d.landiswww.gelwithme.co	1
well , i won't reveal my age here , i don't know if my teeth yellowed enough need 20 years taken off them , but i say i - others around me - am seeing results after only 3 days this system . i received free sample package through bzzagent , company creates " buzz " products through word mouth . however , i am natural skeptic ... i guess i believed these products just out there prey vulnerable smokers who self-conscious all us non-smokers picking them . non-smoker who nevertheless loves dark-coloured drinks ( coke , root beer , tea , coffee ) , i've never used any kind whitening product , except toothpastes which didn't work . crest whitestrips commercials , i thought strips would something almost invisible you could wear while work , subway or wherever . not quite ! what it worth , they sort look feel like bandaids your teeth ; slippery bandaids wiggle around if you try anything more stressful than write amazon reviews . :-) but let put this into perspective : you use them twice day ( 1/2 hr each time ) ten days you're good long while ( how long depends your personal eating/drinking/smoking habits ) . you even use one strip 1/2 hour , then start your second strip right away afterwards ... get it all over even faster . first evening i tried whitestrips renewal , i put them watch tv , i don't think i them quite right because they kept slipping around . also , i didn't rinse my fingers peroxide made my fingertips turn white sting . however , quick rinse took care . not get this stuff your eyes , your clothing or any other delicate surface . it powerful stuff ! anyway , i cursing strips until i realized i would just not speak half hour while i them . maybe other people manage it , but talking doesn't work me strips . since then , it breeze each time . so ... i guess caveats you should set aside time this , during tv-watching or web-surfing downtime ( bonus , you may lose weight not snacking half-hour ! ) , not expect out doing errands strips like people commercials seem able . anyway , if you want turn back clock few years turn up compliments , whitestrips renewal system seems like great way go - fraction cost professional dental whitening	1

i finally bought shower mirror . this one works grea t.t he light stays 5 minutes auto shuts off . it little razor holder it it doesn't steam up ! great mirror !	1
i think it stayed fogless two uses . after , it fogged up like any ordinary mirror - even using " special glass cleaner " it came . too bad . total dissappointment .	-1
i like this - i tie it my waist , adjust it where it hurts , keep going . this type cold pack doesn't seem cold me real ice or gel types , but it good its type . when i needed it colder , i held gel pack it	1
my husband really enjoyed this trimmer . such inexpensive item it gives great results	1
like original eternity , eternity purple orchid sweet-smelling scent , but it much more flowery than its parent fragrance . upon initial application , purple orchid intense floral bouquet bit strong my tastes . over time , however , scent becomes significantly softer , making flower notes more subtle taking more powdery , slightly musky quality . this makes purple orchid pretty , muted daytime fragrance , although it might too delicate those who prefer bolder perfume	1
after many years using braun " straight blade " electric razor , i very pleasantly surprised how well easily this shaved . my only disappointment there no led display when razor power low -- it just stops . i still hate shave , but $70 i paid this , its great i highly recommend it	1
this my chance see if reviews you read here real people got product .. :) i got this shaver month ago .. i using regular wet razor got tired run work piece toilet paper so i could clean blood coming out my face . it also pain butt spread shaving cream , then get rid it every day . now i am using spectra i'm very happy i t.t he instructions tell you give up 3 weeks your face get used new shaving system . but my opinion , it just way them make you learn first how use machine . i not notice any differences skin or shave after " getting used " period compared first day i used norelco . but i not mean there no difference skin . you feel skin lot better softer after fist shave this system vs . razor . i am still learning how get best shave it . i shaved my face point i got closer shave than razor few times . other times i get just ok shave , but not close before . i think it depends how hair reacts machine any given day . sometimes i spend more time get same results other days . but no more than 5 minutes . i always used it normal mode . this way it supposed fastest . my tip you would this : instructions tell you shave your face clean . but if you shave right after taking your daily shower , like your face gets humid less slippery norelco . i better results my face really dry . so i clean my face night before shave when i wake up , before taking my shower . this way i my face clean really dry . sometimes you make more than gentle pressure heads your face catch cut hair closer . i got some irritation my lower part neck few times ... it little difficult catch hairs area .. may because skin softer there . battery last lot . it very practical machine , comes pouch so i shave mornings i wake up my girlfriend home . no more blood me . but take care your lip . once i catch it little spectra got bad feeling it few days . i think some more time , i perfect technique always get shave i want spectra 8825xl . i recommend this machine anyone . it great . sorry my bad english .. i speak spanish . good luck !	1
my electric shaver everything i wanted . i saved so much money , great service , great product , got here quicker than expected .. thank you , i'll shop you again ..	1
new mom i so afraid take my baby temperature ... i might hurt her or put it too far . then i saw this thermometer couldn't get over how easy it use . i found it very accurate . i purchased this two baby showers since buying it myself . it gives great peace mind	1
i other thermometers i using until one day they gave normal reading my daughter burning up i knew she fever . i used this thermometer , which confirmed she fever ... so easy use . just put some vaseline end you not insert it too far . i think package actually says it takes longer get reading than it really ... it very fast ! i no problem buying more expensive products when they work , but don't waste your money $50 thermometers ... they not accurate ! this one great doctors want you take rectal reading anyway !!	1
i've used these aquis towels before , i purchased this one due size - previously they only available small sizes . this body size , my surprise , surface feels better so it doesn't " snag " your skin you rub it . it still its job - making you dry .	1
installation this shower head little tricky . head arm * heavy * so extra plumber tape joint arm pipe comes out wall needed order avoid leaks . comparison rain-pour shower head i , water pressure this showhead awesome ! i agree previous review point pulsating rain little lame . however , fact shower head made plastic keeps water hot . i've noticed significant difference temperature my morning shows ! i recommend this product	1
remarkably accurate ! i only found two wrist bp monitors which provided accurate results time time again . hospice nurse i try inflict little discomfort possible my patients . this monitor detected bp when my arm cuff unable so . this my second purchase this model brand because my 91 y/o grandmother swiped first one . : -	1
i bought this after advice curly hair forum , it speeds drying therefore cuts down frizz . i agree it seem speed drying time hair when it wrapped this , but it feels terrible against skin . this not kind towel one would want use anything but hair . when you touch it ( any microfiber towel matter ) , it feels like your skin very , very dry because it catches every fiber . it soaks water hair dries quickly afterward when i hang it over side tub . it would help if it little bit wider , but this size seems standard	1
i using regular razor years but price blades figured something like this would worth it , when i saw this sale 50 bucks i jumped it . i only used it twice already noticed closer shave , so i highly reccomend this razor !	1
i like quietness shaver , closeness shave , lightness razor . also , i like larger holding area whiskers . i don't like not able buy solution locally , or even norelco website . i don't know what i'll when i run out solution	1
great price good shaver . this replaced my other braun shaver several years old . i gotten many years service old one . i like guard protects screen on/off button . i travel lot my old one get turned travel dead when i arrive . it won't happen this one due design guard	1
i wanted electric afternoon shaving . something faster than good old blade . this works very well . afternoon shave makes morning shave lot easier faster . blades stay cleaner less likely nick . price represents good value . only area shaver seems problems back jaw just below ear . knowing i compensate . easy clean . battery lasted weeks . fit either hand very comfortable . overall great little shaver price . tip blade users , try using shave soap brush place stuff . better shave lot less expensive , don't forget put little water cup after your shave so it not dry out	1
this , obviously , waterpik " econo " hand-held showerhead . i using their showerheads least 15 years , see no difference quality this one its higher-priced siblings . apparently , merely limiting number settings 3 , waterpik hold price down fraction what their more expensive models fetch . me , its perfect . i noticed previous model i owned , i used only regular spray , pulsating massage , occasionally , combination setting . precisely what jm-351 offers . why pay more settings i don't use ? regular spray pleasant , refreshing " needle " type spray provides good flow water even rinsing shampoo out hair . massage provides forceful pulsation actually massage ! fact , it so forceful you need careful where you point it . but sore shoulder or spasming back , its great . combination setting continuous - , you rotate head spray massage , you gradually get less spray more massage . jm-351 curved handle , which not typical waterpiks what i tell . this yields one advantage one disadvantage . because handle pronounced curve , if you tilt pivot ball downward , you get spray point straight down . this permits you easily step out water spray while you soap up , shave or whatever . my old straight-handled model , this not possible . unfortunately , curve also makes handle slightly less comfortable hold than if it straight - especially soapy , slippery hands . not big problem , but noticeable enough make it worth mentioning . installation hint : waterpik very good maintaining same size fittings thread sizes across their entire line over time . if you replacing existing waterpik , you replace just hose handle , while continuing use existing pivot ball bracket . fact , if your current hose good condition , you could replace just handle . 30-second installation ! my only ( minor ) complaint after 2 months 60 hot showers , hose not completely relaxed . it still sort " sticks out " instead just dangling limply bracket way old one . i expect eventually this happen . if you not " style-monster " who requires more elegantly appointed showerhead , if you need only basic spray massage patterns , this your showerhead . highly recommended	1

i am big fan rayovac rechargeable batteries . i primarily use aa aaa batteries . we would normally go through large number batteries ( especially aa ) now we don't . my recharge count continues grow , i only dispose 1 or 2 batteries . they also tend more powerful then average non-rechargabel aa battery . they great cameras , toys , remote controls , portable electronics . i set each child they keep track them keep them charged . it reallys saves money hassel . additionally , i don't keep throwing batteries into trash , which great	1

steam rollers works so great i bought back up set event one breaks . my hair chemically relaxed very porous , so i surprised steam rollers worked so well ( steam or humidity under normal circumstances turns my hair into frizzy mess ) . i recommend using paper ends not over fill water . hair turns out healthy consistently soft , smooth , silky lots body .	1
first i skeptical because i've always used curling irons past . top , my ventures into hot roller systems weren't wonderful . they hot one bulky . set enough curlers fit my head took up way too much counter space . curling irons ok alternative me many years but it would burn if it too hot or not curl if it wasn't hot enough . soon i wasn't doing anything except blow drying ... then i decided get this set . i've never heard steam setter before but it sounded like it worth try . i'm so glad i ! it mix sponge curlers heated curlers so it pretty comfortable because it softer lighter than regular hot rollers . but it still easy snap right into your hair . steam secret ( i use filtered/bottled water because i'm afraid hard water build up unit . i just keep bottle my bathroom ) . you hair unstylably dry it would still curl . plus steam leaves your hair soft , just like when you first blow-dry wet hair . i usually put curlers before going through my morning make-up routine . you should take them out before you change or if you 30 minute car ride , take them out before you leave house so curls loosen up bit . that all there too it . if you want set some hair spray ... go right ahead ! this product comes unit produces steam which regular ionic mode . i don't know what difference except when it ionic mode , it creates more steam more noisy . regular mode silent . it also comes lots rollers 3 sizes . you stow curlers away under sink or closet just leave steam unit your counter ( it size box olay facial cloths ) . you should try it if you want curl your hair often . unless you put your hand right up steam vent , there no chance you burning yourself rollers don't get hot enough damage your hair either . like all curling products , it takes practice couple trail runs get configuration timing down . then , it piece cake	1
i recently purchased this product cold winter months north . i also put lots lotion prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy but dreaded putting cold lotion . this product i would definately recommend anyone likes put lotion but hates putting it cold	1
first spray , this pretty potent cologne , but after 1-2 minutes this fades into nice rosey spice scent much lighter than it green original polo brother . lasts all day long into night . worth checking out if you fan cool water lotto , or lighter scented cologne .	1
i used older model sonicare toothbrush several years very happy results . your gums feel great your teeth really cleaned well . so , i decided update purchased i8300 . once you get used it ( little bulky ) i don't think there toothbrush compare it . concept toothpaste guided you your teeth gums just push button great . afer using it just once , you think your teeth gums cleaned professional . this one great toothbrush i highly recommend it , especially people who gum problems . there one drawback , toothpaste refills only made crest . but , you don't use refills just put your own brand toothbrush . overall , great product	1
this item going into trash since it performs so poorly it not worth price replacement brushes toothpaste cartridges ( which it consumes voraciously ) . therefore , i decided bite bullet throw it out - actuality throwing out over $100.00 . however , i wanted warn other unsuspecting consumers not mislead claims made manufacturer its ads . this produce not get teeth - it definitely not close flossing it effect ( nowhere near it fact ) . also , toothpaste not flow evenly - it either clumps up turns into gooey mess or comes out too fast gets all over toothbrush counter . when i e-mailed sonicare , ( incidentally you open " account " them before they even accept your e-mail ) , i told time frame refund passed they sorry i didn't like their product - period ! when i wrote them back asking them least provide name retailer my area who carries replacement brushes - wal-mart stopped handling brushes particular model - so i would not pay shipping handling costs top everything else , they not even give me courtesy reply . bottom line my dentist told me my teeth much worse shape after using this brush than before . i think says it all	-1
i thermometer which normally takes 15 sec read temprature accurately . this one takes 1-2 seconds only . it requires 2 small size battery which provided . 20 probe covers also included set . before using thermometer directly , go through user manual otherwise you end up getting wrong temprature . they given details pictures words which very much explains infrared technique utilized this . i initially getting incorrect temprature but later after some practice , using it properly . good thermometer 20 bucks . only drawback i found , battery cover which seems very fragile like other mark fitness products battery cover . why don't they fix this problem :|	1

my husband i both back problems moist heat seems ease pain times . we've always told moist heat best . i finally decided " bite bullet " buy new heating pad ( ours least 20 years old ) . you not add any water this pad - it pulls moisture air ; it electric , shut off after 30 minutes . you control heat . this worth investment we very happy it	1
genious came up idea make this shape around shoulders neck !! love it ! i also regular size theratherm i highly recommend them both . i love digital display set your temp timer shut-off , cause i sometimes fall asleep don't worry it left . these pads heavy weight so they slide around you never add water , it idiot-proof	1

i just bought this item today after going through multiple alarm clock/music combo models . this one most features i looking . pros : works any ipod , digital am/fm tuner , neat projection , calming sounds feature , nice design , good sound quality , dual alarms , sets itself , lithium ion battery case power outage . while this one kind nitt picky it important me , it back forth dial setting alarm . way while setting it if you accidentally go past time when you want wake up you just push backward instead going all way back through . it very easy se t.t he cons : kinda pricey , kinda big , " beep " really irritating ( but you wake up ipod , radio , or soothing sounds ) , no remote , you need scan through music ipod via click wheel ( no scan buttons actual machine ) . despite few cons , i would say this worth 80 bucks . i am enjoying mine	1

i heard tingler years , found listing amazon quite randomly . this least expensive one , so i decided see what all hub-bub . it really indescrible sensation , but name tingler pretty much sums it up . most common reaction i get it lot squealing , even guys . i one friend , though , absolutely hates it ; i think it may just too intense her . even my cat dog like it!it truely unique sensation , even little addicting . certainly not one life necessities , but definitely one it little pleasures	1

i lost set these perfect hot curlers while traveling while back- after depending them many years . i thought i'd never find them again- they'd stopped making them ! originally i found them my drugstore-but couldn't find them again any store or web . ( it would help if they called them " hot curlers " !!! not hot setters !!! ) so now last 2 years i've tried every brand made , i think . frustrated these other inferior products , i finally tried stab finding something comparable web again voila ! nothing else compares these perfect hot curlers curling my hair quickly ! light-weight , compact , superfast heat-up , perfectly set lasting curl , don't get tangled your hair when you pull them out , leave your hair smooth- no lumps bumps , travel europe other non-us countries just adaptor plug , what else you want ? oh , curler size perfect . this hot setter 5 great workhorse great job fast , saves me time , makes my hair look beautiful . i get lots compliments my hair- it so easy ! i wear stylish but spend just 10 15 minutes heating , curling brushing . i also found using hair products give my hair little extra body hair spray makes hot curl really last . i lighten my hair these don't any damage . buy them , you won't sorry !	1
i tried replace my old norelco which worked pretty good . i thought going new norelco would upgrade -- not so . this thing worse than my 5 year-old shaver . it comes bunch worthless junk ( jet cleaning system ? ) . worst all , it rips hair our my face which obviously hurts !! don't buy this thing , please	-1
razor shaves pretty well , however , cleaning unit not function . when i called norelco they told me likely cause chip razor unit not " communicating " cleaning unit -- suggesting it problem not uncommon company knows . replacement procedures would take up four weeks get replacement razor my hands -- leaving me without razor interem -- not good way keep you customers satisfied . addition , razor uses three rubber shock absorbers function well , but which i see wear down over time ( certainly well before any plastic components razor would wear out ) . this poor design my opinion . these problems led me return razor refund . i've used norelco razors 30 years , but this my last one	1

it helps you dry burns wattery thing inside your face ou t.t his non toxic device used heat up pimples until it get small dry . this product better than proactiv . proactive not work my face instead it irritates get wors t.t ry wash your face dove skin soap more than 1hr soften your face remove pus . then , path it dry use zeno , don't over use this product because it might hurt burn your skin . failure use this product properly might cause 1st degree burn . never use any chemicals your face while using this product . excessive large pimples , i see some people apply clean duct tape their face , keep it 3-8 hrs remove it . you would notice all pus lying your face you just need clean it using clean water skin soap .	1
i few " cheap " humidifers like this before . most use filters . none them gives out visible water steam like this one . this one really works ! one hour , it able raise humidity my average size bedroom ( door opened ) 31% 40% . when i left it overnight smallest steam volume setting , humidity my room raised 61% ! i never seen something quite like this before . it very quiet except water dripping sound which i take it like it raining outside . i don't problem water spilling all over like some other reviewers . i think they didn't screw bottom cap properly . there only little bit moisture around base but nothing serious . only regret ? can't preset humidity stop steam it reaches there . but then , this price , what more you expect ? i rate it 5-star	1
this perfume truly best one out there . probably only ones come close hugo , armani code polo blue . great anytime day or night . always favorite among ladies .	1

terrible product : 1 . water not stay warm nor it heat up2 . attachments not stay ... attached3 . during operation , water splashes out . even water level below recommended water level . this product not worth what i paid . fact , based upon 3 issues mentioned it not bargin any price . buyer beware	-1
after trying this product , i am disappointed . it not all it hyped up . instead helping me sleep better , it caused me more awake . i tossed turned after taking this product more than i before taking this product . i find something better or more effective	1
better than those little tiny heads . who likes little tiny heads ? i don't like little tiny heads	1
i really enjoyed ordering this product online because it lasted me long time . before ordering this product i go store more frequently buy diapers . i looked everywhere box this size rather impressed when i found it here this site . love this product !	1

i spent long time searching shaver promised me 5 o clock shadow look . after doing extensive research , i ruled out " vaccum " models , since i didnt expect keep long beard . i wanted , just enough 2-3 day stubble . 1 ) build quality - mb300 felt solid my hand . 2 ) efficiency - well , one reviewers said remington mb300 not suitable very short facial hair i agree him . out box , this true , even setting set 1(lowest ) . though reminton says 1-2 settings gives 5 o clock shadow , i dont agree . but if one removes protector , then one get close trim . i wanted even shorter trim . finally , pop trimmer gave me look i wanted , smart 2-3 days look stubble . it not pop up trimmer , i might returned this one . guys who plan buy mb400 should not , it doesn't pop up trimmer . 3 ) first few times i used it , i experienced slight skin irritation . i attribute this my inability use trimmer correctly . its better now . overall , i am happy " now " . dual voltage option would great .	1
i've tried couple other brands those always seem underpowered . this one different - it plenty power massage motor . some shapes little weird no apparent anatomical reason , but this feels like pulse rather than like buzzer	1
this one lives up its advertising , folks ! it quick , easy , painless , quite effective . my advice shave regular razor one day get required stubble needed seiko ( anything longer won't get cut ) , then use seiko before your shower every day thereafter . bikini area hard place keep smooth ! this electric razor makes it much easier	1

if you love loose leaf tea , you love this stainless steel mesh tea ball . there nice little latch ( you sort see left tea ball top ) which keeps all tea leaves safely tea ball never lets them into your tea pot or mug . i fill this my favorite jasmine tea or provence rooibos , which always loose leaf it seems , then hang metal hook over edge mug so i easily remove it . just let tea ball sit mug bit then swirl it around remove it . i suggest rinsing it immediately then opening it let it dry out . mine never rusted ! i would not put this dishwasher ! i just think it so many uses , you also use it hot apple cider when you want add cloves pieces cinnamon or you use it filled herbs when making stock . i just love it . ~ rebecca revie	1

i earlier model braun travel shaver mediocre -- little weak shaving power it would sometimes turn movement my travel bag . this one plenty power , microscreen allows very close shave , plus it rotating lock switch prevents it accidentally turning itself . fact , i like this shaver so well , even though i ordinarily use blade , sometimes i'll pick it up home quick shave or evening touch-up before going out . one drawback -- while it generally shaves close blade , if i skip day shaving two days ' worth beard , this shaver little trouble cutting -- it tends slide over matted down hairs somewhat it takes some work get them all cut . i think that characteristic microscreen shavers	1
this tub stool perfect . i very small shower this stool small enough fit it comfortable secure sit . i can't find one thing wrong it	1
this epilator its job . it less painful compared others because skin protector cap , but really short hair you take it off otherwise it won't grab hair . batery doesn't last long so large jobs ( like legs ) you keep it plugged , but cordless really helps those smaller jobs odd angles ..	1
i've using it 3 years now ( though i just purchased new one after losing it ) it really impressive product . it exactly what it says it . i think it especially useful when you also remington precision trimmer smallest details	1

i owned one these years just loved it . when my daughter injured her back i lent it her course didn't see it again so then came time when i wanted heating pad didn't one . took trip walmart purchased most expensive moist heating pad they which around $29.00 . what waste money ( slow , not enough heat , barely any moisture ) it really got me appreciate how awesome these professional moist heating pads . extent which these pads produce moist ( i mean moist ) heat amazing they it matter minutes enough justify price alone . dollar dollar this large pad worth its weight gold . although it heavier than those department store pads weight big selling point . it actually helps it feel good your back because pad weighted down it closer your skin . it also makes it so pad not slipping off or moving around your back . flannel cover substantial high quality material(not thin , rough or cheap fabric ) soft cozy . it washable well . controls easy operate . bottom line nothing out there compares these professional pads . don't waste your time money anything else .	1
this definitely best shaver i ever owned . motorin this shaver very strong powerful . i tough beard it shaves close blade , just like remington slogan says . also , features come shaver great too .	1
shipping took more than 2 weeks reach me . there package damage got ship back amazon but never shipped back me until i call customer service . customer service great though	1
this item worked very well us keep our 20 month old opening several doors . however , if you very thin door handles , you may need tape some cardboard around handles pad them up enough make sure this snaps back into place . it only took me 30 minutes install 6 these , so i'm not so sure other reviewer comment . we always open these one handed , so our son doesn't figure out how open it -- his hands too small it one hand . if he saw us it two , he would probably figure it out ! reviewers who wrote this won't work left-handed doors or who think it lock you out other side clueless . this item used either side door , when installed side interior door without lock it set up allow access hole unlocking locked door , it not lock door other side	1

starting out ' 50 remington into ' 60 blade , i continued blade until i received 7240xl . my hand started shake i using lots styptic stick so decided try electric . i found 7240xl line read time 19 reviews which convinced me give it try . i cannot say enough good things this shaver . shave i get now equal or better than blades no styptic . i found less pressure i apply better shave . first few days difficult my neck but once i reduced pressure shaver i not issue . it holds charge 10 days very quiet . rinsing under faucet real plus . i highly recommend this shaver . i wish i tried it sooner .	1
replaced 10 year old norelco found this far best electric razor i've ever used . closest shaves i've ever .	1
i'm doing this little review case anyone wondering what " twilight crush " color looks like . colors aren't described well , all colors picture aren't listed , so you can't easily tell which which . now clicking color choice bring you single product screen , which better than few weeks ago , when i bought mine . i mistakenly thought shimmer twilight crush pillow distorting way color appeared picture , it pretty color rose girl holding . instead , it strange , shimmery green burgundy red color , quite similar picture they up now , but where picture looks brown , it actually much more red . shimmery green dominant color , however , red more " background " color . my opinion , it not very pleasant look , but it smells good , maybe i'll get used odd color combination . if i could it over , i'd go blue feather color choice ... i'd also wondered why it funny little heart sewn onto front pillow . that actually little pocket , inside which very small cloth scent packet . rest filling accessed through velcro pouch back pillow . open it up , you'll find pouch unscented buckwheat . this quite nice ; case you don't like way scent smells , you remove it ; also so you're not over-heating scent packet when you heat buckwheat packet	1
great shaver . good price . easy clean . easy use . shaves almost close blade	1
i used original epilady years now new modelwhich great . very satisfied	1
after getting used initial " shock " feeling hair removed , i found using epilady way better than conventional razor . i especially like it because it cordless .	1
epilady legend best hair removal system i ever used . legend leaves legs smooth weeks time , hair grows much finer . pain very tollerable diminishes time use . it definitely worth it , considering it only once every 3-5 weeks . i loyal user many years would not replace it anything else ! i highly recommend legend everyone	1
i love my sonicare intelliclean system ! i've difficulty finding replacement heads stores but i'm becoming online guru . i love fact amazon makes it too easy buy replacement heads i never spend hours going store store looking this again . i love extra burst toothpaste i give myself while brushing . i love timed ' zone ' beep . brush head cleans quickly dash water toothbrush holds charge week so i unplug recharger save energy ( one many stop global warming )	1
item ordered ( arrived ) item exactly it pictured presented . it arrived timely manner	1
every time i pass baby food display store , i think how many millions dollars parents could saving , if they would just make their own baby food , rather than paying top price those cute little jars ! i take every opportunity tell parents using hand baby food mill . $10 i paid my baby food mill definitely one best investments i ever made ! i purchased it my first six children , just loved it ! i found it much , much more convenient than blender , several reasons . blender fine preparing large batches baby food freeze , but not bit practical making single serving your baby . blender much more difficult clean , not very practical take table , it difficult get all food out bottom it . noise it doesn't make it especially handy table use , either . hand grinder perfectly quiet , makes use every bit food you put into it , taken used anywhere ! it very handy feeding baby out , directly , parts easy hand wash or thrown dishwasher . also , it very easy feed baby some same foods you prepared your whole family . food not come out pureed , like blender , but i found my babies preferred little texture . it used almost anything except hard , dry foods , like chips , or taco shells . many harder foods , like fresh apples , should diced first . some foods come out better addition little water or other liquid . my grinder retirement now , after 14 years use , but it still good working order . i am saving it day when i grandchildren use it ! i just can't say enough good it , hope many parents try it . it makes excellent baby gift , too !	1
this best meal replacement shake i ever tasted . first time , i mixed it skim milk , but it came out extremely thick , so now i just use water , it still tastes great . no joke , it tastes almost like chocolate pudding . , plus fact it replaces meal contains only 3g fat , 19g carbs , 260 calories , still manages pack 38g protein , 3g fiber , ton vitamins each serving . each packet only costs $1.45 . if you get tired just chocolate , mix scoop peanut butter it blender . it doesn't get much better than this	1
i got this yesterday tried it . i can't say enough it . works great , less pain , mess hassle waxing i love it	1
i never write reviews , but when shopping epilator i disappointed there no reviews this product because i rely quite bit customer reviews products like this . i lifelong waxer , result i developed quite high pain tolerance . while this product works extremely well ( doesn't really hurt legs ) i say beginning , bikini area pretty painful . after using it while , pain diminishes but no means pleasure . besides obvious discomfort associated pulling your hair out , this really great product i highly recommend it	1
this fragrance miyake , best . scent last hours , its not appealing male gender but surely captivate attention women .	1
i use armani acqua di gio chanel homme often but i've found lot people smelling like me . di gio too common . issey miyake just right- not enough people know it it smells wonderful . it fruity , light over-tones leave you thinking tokyo during spring time . my girlfriend can't get enough it wear my shirts when i'm away close scent . if you're willing splurge acqua di gio , you should try issey miyake . l'eau d'issey one miyake older fragrances . his newer stuff smells similar but i don't like it much . really d'issey miyake chanel no . 5 . it classic really one kind fragrance make you want more .	1
... well , i'd rather masseuse house on-demand , but theracane great substitute . i tried using tennis balls rolling them , but theracane not only more effective , but easier use . i'm going buy some friends same age related neck aches	1
i bought these clippers take deployemnt iraq . i found them quite good cutting short military style haircuts . it battery plenty life manage whole haircut juice spare . guides work well , but not enough variety adjustment shorter lengths " buzz cuts " i would like blades cut bit closer scalp without guides . clippers lack heft i wonder their durability over time . while these clippers should not considered replacement proper plug-in model they resonable substitute particularly if one traveling outside us where 50 hz power makes regular clippers unusable	1
i used this haircut kit myself friend , it working very good . adjustable combs work fine , i couldn't find any other much range sizes . i haven't any trouble regarding adjusting lock nor weakness combs . it giving me good results saving me money . i took risk buy it , although previous reviews weren't good , i'm happy it didn't disappointed me . i would like left/right ear combs this trimmer , though	1
i agree so many others . nursing mom 7 children , i say confidence - these best	1
nursing mom you ever walked around , public , wet circles your shirt not know it ? i , so embarassing ! infact , i returning different brand nursing pad target . i complained clerk return desk , happened young male , how terrible this item i needed return purchase something else . his smirk should clued me . i left store feeling content my shopping trip i felt cool breeze my chest . kinda odd hot august day so i looked down see two huge wet spots my shirt !!!!! nice , huh ?! since day , my purchase lansinoh nursing pads , i alway worn these . they thin hold good amount milk , great those who constant let-downs like myself . they not noticable under clothing like other bulkier pads . very comfortable ! special occasions try lilypadz , silicone nursing pads . check it out , they gently stick your skin washable . they perfect dress you can't wear bra ideal when you go swimming . no need baby diaper your boobs swell up after dip	1
tines could little less flexible give you really good scratch , but overall , i love it . i've never seen anything so trippy everyone who sees this needs try it	1
i purchased this roller set gift someone after reading amazon reviews ; her experience not match those other reviewers . remington h-1080n rollers slow heat , roller clamps difficult place proper position , it difficult put rollers back their proper slots when finished . product design fundamentally flawed : clamps , rollers , parking slots not color-coded . this item returned my shipping expense --- 15 year old clairol unit this item meant replace heats faster works better	-1
i never really loved this heating pad . contents within rubber get twisted easily , it seemed heat unevenly times , towards end its life i actually heard little clicking noises coming it . i got it christmas last year , used it few days after .... then last night it died . no heat , though light went . this thing weekly use my couch -- never left 5 foot radius . i didn't fold it up , i never used it moisture . year use letdown .	1
i liked this product lot because it easy use , well discreet compact . it great travelling . trimmer allows you take off much or little hair possible , although when i took off trimmer comb attachment used only shaver , i nicked myself few times . there shaving attachment which you can't use bikini area ( due density hair ) , but i've used it my legs great results	1
best diapers market ! i never any leaks , they fit perfectly it best value your money .	1

this far worse tasting stuff i've ever i've plenty my venture healthy person . owner health food store my neighborhood swears this product , so , i bought it 3 years ago . it now one my daily drinks . it taste awful if you don't play it drink . i put soy milk ( approx . 8 ounces , flaxseed oil ( 1-2 tablespoons ) , lecithin , banana . if these items you don't use , play this product . it worth health benefits . i love it swear it . eve	1
finally product acually massages your foot . this really works greatfor price . not good human(if you find someone who willing it ) , but very satisfing	1
great product . much quieter than i expected . doesn't seem blow hard old style but it dries faster . better than old style too because it doesn't blow your hair all over	1
many perfumes give me headache , this one doesn't . besides , it perfect blend fruity , woody spicy , tendency toward spicy , least my skin . i wear it day night , thou i tend take it out more often winter approaches.as all perfumes , you try it your skin see ( sniff :)) yourself .	1

i skeptical genie able lift my thick 13 " mattress , but , because medical reasons , thought i'd give it try . i'm sleeping like log lifting head 1 " . it lift it full way reading well . i love it . it bit loud , but you don't need use pump all time it keeps air pretty well . if you sleep alone queen bed , it get bit lopsided if you stay one side , but if you move slightly middle , it isn't problem	1
unknown reason i getting canker sores my tongue over past 2 years . they would come go . after suffering through painful episodes not able eat , talk or move my mouth 3 days worth time it would go away only appear different location . it became endless cycle suffering stressing me out making my life pure discomfort say least . i tried every over counter medication out there you get every drug store area . some take pain away but none them truly eliminated problem . until i tried this toothpaste . this stuff works . it really works . it wasn't until i started use this stuff regularly problem truly went away . i skeptical first , there so many other products out there said same thing " help eliminate canker sores " but this truly what it said it would . just brush your teeth daily morning regular amount toothpaste you normally use . make sure you take your time brush this paste very short time period you notice outbreak canker sores come end . i can't recomend this stuff enough . it really life changer me delievers promised . once you start using it , you won't go back any other alternatives . mint flavor mild toothpaste itself helps clean whiten your teeth . so you getting two services price one this product . finally canker sore victims give sigh pure pain free relief . thanks rembrandt , extra whitening canker sore relief toothpaste . if you looking relief your canker sore outbreaks . this product get . it works ! it works ! it works	1

nice find product actually works well benefits environment not using bleaching process whiten wipes . we same wipe box 7th gen ages continue buy 80 pack wipes refill	1
these great . they least amount yucky stuff them all wipes i seen . course this makes them best baby ! not really more expensive than " normal " wipes . if you order case amazon you get free shipping . what deal ! if you want try them first , call your local health food store . they'll more expensive there , but worth giving them chance	1
guess i not realize measurements where washcloth size , so i ended up ordering mediums , perfect spin class gym ! other than great product	1
if you extreme pain your neck , shoulders , upper back , this excellent product . i degenerative cervical disc disease ms so this product helps ease pain throughout day but expecially morning . forget rectangular pads $20 , this worth every penny . my generates more heat typical low , med , high selections most heating pads . moist heat ability go up 166 degrees . though it dry heat option i can't imagine ever using it because moist heat really penetrates below surface bring you relief . my only complaint cord should extend front flaps not back one . it little annoying but overall worth small inconvenience every penny i paid it	1
time my enemy . i live two places-in country city -- crazy job . result : little time myself . i insist products work well quickly . heel smoother perfect . amazing , really . i can't afford bloody feet-a danger some foot products-as i race around city , largely foot , run country . addition , i am petrified pain . no problem heel smoother ! person who complained battery short life , i recommend set rechargeable batteries . i use them my digital camera . this product worth try .	1
i cartilage tears my knees - i started using this within week i without knee pain running beach 4 days row no pain or swelling since second week using this - couldn't before - i am physician started recommending it my patients - mix it blueberries , acai berries or grape juice blender mix easier cut taste ( i just use water shake it up ) - or use pills if you want - i also recommend green vibrance it - antiinflammatory component it . i combine both - bit strong taste but i only use water - mix juice	1
ok , don't compare this shaver ones costing twice much . said , price this great shaver . it gives me close shave , operated much sleepier condition than mach 3 , my blade choice . it works fine my goatee ( although i use something else trimming ) works fine when i clean-shaven . it took my skin around week or two get adjusted new shaving technique . but now this works great every morning keeps me good throughout day . only areas i trouble my adam apple under my ear , but i big apple bony jaw my mach 3 tough time these areas . braun beats my mach 3 it never cut me . maintenance clean up breeze . just rinse head under water you're good . want get it extra clean , add some liquid hand-soap rinse , or take foil off brush it down little brush . oil occasionally , replace foil cutting block every 18 months . i think my battery life over 50 minutes , but i'm not really timing it . if i market new shaver , wasn't going spend more upgrade , i definitely choose this one again . it really 4 half stars , just missing last half because it doesn't lot high end bells whistles	1
my braun 6520 served me well few years , but battery died . i would happy replacing battery unit , but apparently not option . i contemplated purchase more expensive , highly-rated braun unit self-cleaning station , but thought better it because it seemed like more bulk bother ( e.g. purchase replacement cleaning solution ) than i really needed . i settled 5614 i am pleased . i shaved two weeks before exhausting battery . shaver recharged hour . other reviewers pointed out , charge deplete very rapidly once low-charge light comes , but according specs , i shave cord ( not yet tried it ) or battery power . i love hard case -- it protects shaver head dents dings , which problem my old unit . true , ac cord not fit case , but doesn't bother me bit . shave quality very good . trimmer adequate , but oriented parallel long dimension shaver , instead 90 degree angle . took some getting used , but i adapted . summary , exceptionally high performance : price ratio . 5614 just right me .	1
shaves well . i don't use trimmer much , but it seems work ok me . three design negativescord doesn't fit casecord appears 110vac transformer so would need special , more expensive cord 220v . my previous braun transformer built accomodat any voltage , so it simply needed cheap cord european plug when i travelled . case broke after less than year . braun cases less well built than shavers general	1
razor offers close shave , conveniently used wet or dry , rinsed liquid soap clean it . all all very nice . my only complaints razor little heavier than expected , which inconvenient travel razor , i thought it came rechargeable lithium batteries . no , they disposable lithium batteries . still , they should good 50-60 uses changing . razor compact form factor , wet/dry functionality , close shave outweigh negatives	1
i don't understand previous reviewer comments not able use this unless sitting . i lying down last night my stomach it worked great my back ! i like it better than my thumper ii because it much easier me handle more lightweight ! i never able handle thumper my own . i love all massage choices , especially chopping motion ... it if someone pounding my back , it so targeted i spend much time i want one location without it itching most massagers ! ( i hour hour half commute work each way , so my neck shoulders get extremely sore . ) i love it so much i bought one my boss , am thinking giving one everyone my family christmas	1
love love love this heating pad ... auto turn off great feature ... 4 settings ... only flaw control thing pretty big ... other than its great .....	1

excellent product recommended my dentist . this second one i owned . first one lasted 3 years . not bad $40.00	1
my dental hygenist recommeded this item it works better than i expected . it already improved my gums saved me oral surgery . this basic item unless you're idiot it all you need sonic care toothbrush . all more expensive versions offer needless beeps ways let you know when 30 seconds up . if you hate flossing aren't likely keep up it , this sonicare job your teeth	1
my old sonicare finally crapped out i needed new one . i saw this one amazon , which exactly like my old one . sure they " new improved " ones now , but they basically same thing cost almost twice much . this best bet money . it works great keeps my teeth clean shiny visits dentist .	1
this really nice little fountain . i it my wish list received it gift , i concerned because it seemed larger than i originally thought . but when assembled , it stands only 10 " tall , which perfect my desk work . sound trickling water quiet enough it isn't discernable my co-workers it very attractive addition my cube . only problem , it doesn't come enough rocks cover base , but rocks easy come . , although it isn't copper , color such you can't really tell 3 feet away . i recommend this product	1
fountain isn't copper all . it brown plastic . it only looks slightly copper-like when lights off room lights fountain water make leaves look tad coppery . if you're looking real copper fountain , this ain't it ! other than , it nice fountain . small , it even quite bit water noise . pump quiet , but water flow good . there two speeds pump water flow . there lot places where water flows one height - which my cat loves . it could use some additional rocks , though	1
this good value . it appears durable . i would liked slightly larger pad , but it job	1
i bought this heating pad my husband because certain ailments he . he very pleased how well quickly it heated maintained warmth . most heating pads i bought past not heat all too good . very pleased found this pad would buy one our household or gift	1
i love this product , order more shortly . i especially impressed w/the speed delivered products . thank you .	1
i ordered it , but used it only little while until i switched formula . it useful , pain went away . price amazon bit higher than price you would find ordinary pharmacies	1
this must breastfeeding moms . i used it all time beginning . it helped prevent cracks soarness . great product safe baby	1
my 18 month daughter wearing these going 6 months . she not want lay down get changed ... when we've decided she needs change we say " let go potty get clean diaper " . she leads us into bathroom stands while we change her ( we make sure there plenty her look ) . rip , rip sides diaper , quick ( or not so quick ) wipe up then she helps us pull up new diaper ... even helps us " empty " into toilet flush . she not quite ready potty training , i don't think she knows yet when she actually going , but this helps her feel independent ... she also becoming comfortable toilet which hopefully help us when we actually potty training . let me just say this - changing breeze - one less place power struggle . amen ! oh- they also seem give her much more comfortable fit then cruisers	1
great shaver , allways you need replace blades every year or so keep it cutting close	1
besides all other 1 star reviews , i'd just like add this . even applicator garbage . i spread thin layer liquid over my lense , besides tiny bubbles , it also shed hairs applicator all over lense . unbelievable garbage	-1
really good cleanser . not listen one bad review -- sounds like he may allergic reaction . this stuff not harsh all	1
this my first pre-scrubber . i getting bumps just not getting good shave some creams lotions past . after hot shower , rub this , then cream go it . you'll surprised difference it makes shaving	1
after using old heating pad my grandmother 30 years i delighted find updated improved version same company . this pad much improved detachable control machine wash capability . it functions very efficiently timer automatically turn off . it hugs easily contures body . it adequate size cover entire area needing warmth . numbers control large enough read backlit seeing night . it well designed well made product	1
it doesn't get very hot/warm . how large it it didn't get but luke warm . other thank it would wonderful item its size	1
i bought this fountain my desktop work it great ! it very easy set up get it working few minutes right out box . it light , which illuminates water center fountain . fountain easy keep filled , it runs quietly , it provides some humidity during dry winter months . i am very pleased this product . i bought used several fountains , but this one easiest doesn't splash water all over desktop	1
things just seem going downhill my expereinces norelco . i bought my 6618x razor last october quite let down . first , box said it made holland like all my previous shavers ; inside unit it marked made china . next , don't even think this thing operate cord when battery gets flat -- you'll simply wait until it gets recharged . whose idea ? my advice look very carefully see if it operated cord well cordless ; this never concern my past norelco , either they battery or they didn't but they always worked cord . i imagine when battery gets worn out this shaver end up trash . pity	1
cartridges cartridges . however i few blades i swear blade went before beard . others marginal my wife made me use dull down so she could use them . these animals just not dull . gillette must count volume users because gillette would starve death waiting me use enough make production worth while . i use shaving soap just mark area covered there already some sort slick lubricating strip cartridge ; out this strip i would not know when toss cartridges out . there enough space blades allow easy cleaning . one almost look forward shaving . even though they seem last ever i would not want caught last minute out replacement .	1
got these my husband fun , he really likes them , but they little small behind his head . so if you wear large hat size , these aren't ideal . they good readers working his shop	1
these clic glasses great idea ... i first saw them csi-ny , sought them out , but they not made big enough ... they worked fine long i looking down , but soon i turned my head level , or looking up , glasses would " pop " apart . i purchased two pair , returned them both	-1
these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1
my mother all people introduced me this scent when i 24 years old , so going 7 years now . it versatile it worn daytime into night . lasting power could little better , but it lingers . prior introduced burberry , my favorite sexy night scent classic opium . my fiance 7 years not like scents too musky , so he doesn't care my opium . however , he loves burberry london . i'm not good figuring out tones , but it musk tone it but it very soft but yet sexy well . musk tone not overpowering tone this scent , otherwise fiance would not love it much he . it also sophisicated professional scent , but again , soft sexy very versatile .	1
any one who wants check their blood pressure home reasonable accuracy , this one go . i skeptic when i bought it , but once i started using it , it accurate . 35$ , it good buy	1
i recently high blood pressure reading medical appointment ; it gave me bit scare . so , i ordered this hoping better undrestand blood-pressure impact different factors every day life . i chose model extra body fat measurement functions keep check too . when it arrived , i very pleasantly surprised ! it comes great hard-sided case , readings accurate ( least , far i tell ) , it fast easy . i love wrist ( vice arm ) cuff ! not sure battery life , but i'll using rechargeable batteries here out , so it shouldn't matter . ** bottom line ** if you any problems blood pressure all , you're probably aware these issues not just go away if ignored . seriously , consider buying this inexpensive , easy use wrist monitor . it time take care your health !	1
those pieces come out so far you can't get close shave . they only lasted couple shaves then fell off i am glad because now i use razor get close shave	-1
i very skeptical -- using two-blade razor years . but once you get used floppy head , fusion gives incredibly smooth , nick-free shave . i'm out buy second one my travel kit	1
both rayovac energizer selling rechargeable nimh d-cell batteries exact same power rating their nimh aa batteries . also , energizer customer relations reports their alkaline energizer max cell batteries 8x power rating these nimh rechargeables ( 20,500 mah versus 2,500 mah ) . even juice rechargeable nimh d-cell nearly three times power compared these batteries ( 7,000 mah versus 2,500 ) . i guess it " let buyer beware " ...	-1
i like this product two reasons : good price good size .	1
i like this curling brush 3 main reasons . one , it job . two , it starts heating up soon you plug it . other curling brushes , you turn switch make sure it starts heating up . three , it smallest curling brush i've found . it good size curling segment hair you work around your head . others too long . it packs nicely . i used able buy this curling brush supermarkets . i wasn't able find it there any more so i ordered 4 them amazon	1
don't cheap dish out extra $5 get something going get job righ t.t his very cheap looking , but it cheap so how i complain . i don't even know if i call material it made out plastic . it doesn't heat up past luke warm . i like my curling iron get so hot i can't touch it , this one so warm i just leave my finger it without getting burned . i'm pretty sure if i got any hotter than it already material it made would mel t.t he barrel itself very short . it like travel/mini iron . it best this just brush cord it . i gave it two stars because " you get what you pay " maybe this why i am only one give this product review everybody else knew better	1

product worked promised . buy it again gift someone . note : this product doesn't shave hair but just trims it down very acceptable level . very easy use . drains full charged battery less than ten minutes . better start using rechargeable batteries if you mind expense	1
these best curlers i've ever used . they heat very quickly , hold heat , excellent clip holds very well easy use . i prefer these curling iron because i put them , then go task . they lightweight great traveling . they heat up 2 minutes , curl very well . i like them so well , i bought extra sets gifts my daughters .	1

i tried electric razors ten years ago braun model but my skin too sensitive i received nicks cuts poor shave . three years ago , i tried again remington , it worked great my head -- not so great my face . lots nicks , spread rash . i especially disappointed it didn't get my neck very well . both shavers straight foil shavers , i thought they would shave closer than round heads . then , i purchased this norelco over 2 months ago , it worked like dream me . while first week wasn't especially close , it convenient i traveling work . third week , however , shave closer than my regular mach 3 blade shave ! one huge difference : i bought some letric shave pre-shave liquid , which makes whiskers stand up , also disinfects shaving heads . i haven't one cut , no rash , over 60 shaves this unit . since then , i used norelco every morning , letric shave , thrilled results . i also wondered whether my previous experience electric would better i $3.49 get pre-shave splash ! i agree one poster who complained plastic parts - only reason i didn't give product 5 stars . i don't really know how long this unit run . i know 2 months , i already saved more this unit than disposable blades would cost . , travel snap . charges quickly , runs quietly , usually holds its charge entire week . i'm very happy customer	1
electric razor it cuts close fast . recharges well lasts .	1
i went through several reviews comparisons braun 360 norelco latest shaver before finalizing panasonic vortex . i am really glad i decided this one . looks great . it very lightweight , ergonomic . nise level acceptable , not loud or disturbing . swivel head really helps around chin edges . it shaves good or better than mach-3 razor i using before . battery life excellent . i use it dry shaver once every two days use 10% charge each shave . so charge last 15 days . cleaning very easy . it cleaned regular hand liquid soap or cleaning system comes it used . i use system once or twice month it nice job . overall very satisfied would definitely recommend buy if considering electric shaver	1
got panasonic replace older braun . i'm razor guy , but i use electric occasionally . shave this panasonic gives best i ever electric . couple passes , shave approaches closeness razor , but no chance cuts or scrapes . if i want real close shave , razor still wins , but panasonic close second	1
finally , electric , long user willing spend little more time process , provides shave smooth close blade , without all nicks cuts . expensive but worth it ; six stars if option	1
i bought this try get constant " knots " out my wife neck lower back , boy ... let me tell ya ' ... it sure saved me lot time sore hands/fingers ! i used spend almost good 45 minutes trying get " knots " worked out quite often . percussion heat feature sure helps now . this switch 1 . ) off 2 . ) massage 3 . ) massage/heat . it your thumb ( if strapped your right hand ) . variable speed switch rotary dial would end your ring finger . i think only drawback we find this it only 1 heat attachment . other 2 screw attachments made out hard " pliable " ( i say loosely ) hard rubber/plastic compound not capable conducting heat . only red attachment . inside percussion head massager ( where heads screwed onto ) metal shaft where heat emits . only attachment metal center contacts also conduct heat red attachment . black ones not . if you attached them accidentally hit switch past massage into heat zone , you might some melted black attachments !!	1
my new homedics mt-pa palm percussion massager arrived several weeks ago . i using it 4 or 5 times day , every day . i purchased it primarily my neck shoulder areas , but soon found it works wonderfully my feet , arms other places , bringing great relief sore muscles . me , one best things massager , its sensitive adjustibility , which ranges light touch , full , deep , penetrating , pulsing massage , reaching muscles none my other massagers . i love this product . but then i expected it , because it made homedics . this company absolutely hands down , best manufacture making these type products industry today . i always count their products made well , perform highest levels ; so far , always advertised . this my fourth homedics massager i purchased over past six years-and i never disappointed . i highly recommend this hand held massager anyone who needs quick relief stressed muscles . surely one three included attachments should bring relief what ails you . final thought : i really appreciate this company keeping cost its products so affordable .	1
these brushes great substitute expensive professional brushes out there . you get this whole kit cost one high end brushes these nice soft , look great , comfortable your hand . if your looking quality brush set mere fraction cost this set you	1
this product eliminated one step . however , one step took long two steps	1
i disappointed this model . i used my friend wet dry it fantastic . i ordered wet or dry because decrease price $200 $129 . but i should known better ( there reason decrease price ) it not work well wet dry - all . it snagged my hair didn't eliminate frizz - any $20 flat iron would work just same . however , i exchange it medium duality model difference amazing . much better !	1
these glasses perfect someone who keep reading glasses handy . i seen them sale spain $70 italy $100 . amazon price clics certainly best far . only suggestioni they not good airplane reading because if you restyour head seat , back frame moves forward glasseswill not centered properly . they , however , great conversation starter	1
absoultly satified product they always hand no searching my glasses any more they comfortly hanging around my neck easy put place . i would recomend them anyone active job needed reading or close work	1
karastase makes excellent hair products . i like this shampoo , it leaves my hair very silky it great rich lather nice smell . only downside keratase products quite expensive everyday use . i other shampoos i use my first lather , then finish this one . small amount product goes long way . if you leave lather your hair several minutes , it works better	1
i love it !! it works great sinuses !! i just added couple drops essential oils inhaled warm mist couple times day my sinus pressure totally disappeared !! i use it every time i feel congestion or sinus pressure infection never comes	1

this product great instant relief itchy scalp . never leaves your hair or scalp oily . i recommend this anyone who sensitive skin and/or scalp problems	1
product fine far flavor , solubility nutrition . i no idea if it works this seriously 5 day supply . bottle looks big , but it only 2/3 full those 2/3 mostly air . i am certain you could fit entire contents this huge jug into coke . container says 15 servings directions state drink 3 4 servings day . 4 times day this isn't even 4 day supply . i strongly recommend skipping this stuff . i am serious athlete taken quite few different supplements , some which worked some didn't . even those worked not $120-$150 per month . i guess you already pro athlete able afford buying enough this stuff it actually work	-1
best thing muscle milk taste . i first tried rocky road which awesome , than i got cookies cream which wasn't good my opinion . cytosport reccomends it pre/post workout , but i would say it better pre-bed since it mostly casein protein . whey better option pre/post workout . either way you take it , taste awesome ... best tasting protein i've tried yet .	1
very good flavor consistency , but best all , very good formula you actually feel difference consuming it or not	1
jet clean shaving system included package this shaver oversold . structure if shaver head such it easily cleaned warm water immediately after use , so there appears no additional cleaning required . shaver quite similar earlier models same type , so very little difference quality shave noted . placing battery charging hardware plug-in module so only low voltage present shaver cord safety improvement	1
i am very satisfied product purchasing process	1
this product works very well smooth . it feels soft not feel like it pulling hairs my face ( when used one day growth ) . ability rinse razor under water nice feature . cleaning solution seems use up very quickly	1
item just i wanted . no problems . delivery fairly prompt . thanks great service	1

i purchased hairtopia total couple months ago . after few weeks , i got sick huge regimen ( 10 capsules day ! ) so i just started taking one pill each once per day . first , i just noticed my hair thicker , i growing more hair ( like around my hairline - i got little curly fine hairs weren't there before ) . i now widow peak , didn't before . after month using product , people started saying me " wow ! your hair getting so long !! " very nice . it also ( immediately ) made my fingernails grow twice fast they used . i highly recommend this product . gave four stars because price unreasonable regimen	1
basically , this shaver gives me just close shave any high-quality electric shaver . no better , no worse . it never close one those flashy gillette blades , though . i'm one those guys pretty thick , fast growing beard , so this concern me every morning . i've definitely gone through my share various types electrics razors . hands down , there huge convenience factor added self-cleaning . no mess . no hassles . just drop it charger , push button , let it its thing hour . financial standpoint , its mixed bag when comparing standard blades . your typical fusion blade costs $3-$4 , based type beard you , single blade last week , give or take . so per use , its definitely cheaper go electric . however , such high up-front costs purchase braun , changing cleaning cleaning fluid each month around $4/each , it take few years break-even . ( fact , if you want get really technical , inflation interest rates considered , you may never really break-even . i actually distorted enough run these calculations excel . ) however , purely psychological sense , you don't feel like you're getting robbed each time you buy more razors , you just get robbed once . so , summary , solid electric shaver , cool added value convenience , its kind your call whether you think you'll saving money or not	1
very good product . i thinking price little high but this shaver delivers advertised	1
daughter braces ... her teeth never looked better . much improved just using standard toothbrush	1
i received this toothbrush christmas present . i thought getting electronic toothbrush , but i not any research . any case , i eager try it . when i first used it , it took few seconds get used it . i thought it tickled my gums , but very shortly i realize how much " sonic " action toothbrush working cleaning your teeth you just make small circles brush let sonic action rest . i used it couple times already my teeth feel cleaner . i also find it fun use so i end up brushing my teeth lot longer than regular brush . i went see how much refills wal-mart they $7.97 . this why i gave it 4 stars not five . $8 every three months bit more espensive than regular brush ( i usually get free target when they tooth paste / tooth brush packages )	1
i put this lotion night immediately feel my face more moisturized . morning my face also feels softer , smoother not tired days when i not use it . it really worked me !!! it non greasy my fine lines not noticeably . i think this great product	1
this cream wonderful , regenerating serum feels like no night cream i've ever used . i just love it	1
its smooth , fine , pleasing scent . it would better if it longer lasting	1
so far after useing shaver one month , i find it better than most . true review would take 6 months use . my main concern life shaving foil . remington , altough good close shaver , shaving head disintergrates after few months they very expensive replace	1
so far , i am impressed this razor which gives me close , good shave . i gave this razor 4 star rating instead 5 star rating because it not come charging stand , which forces me leave it plugged ( plug end large ) lying bathroom sink , which makes sink area look cluttered . my older braun came charging stand , which made much neater look it sat sink area	1
i got this product my step-granddaughter ( she 13 ) christmas . she absolutely loves it - she able stand there round brush " straighten " her hair she blows it dry . i'm going order one myself now .	1

there so many varied reviews this product depending which version you clicked ! here what i've found mine : first , this intended work adult acne , occasional blemish . sorry teens , this probably isn't best choice you unless you only occasional break-out . second , this only works new pimples so when you get it , don't expect ones you currently suddenly disappear . it works best when you first notice pimple appearing , especially just starting get sore , slight red spot stage . sad , it actually work , provided you keep first two rules mind ! two days after i received mine , i noticed tell tale red spot beginning form , i zapped it not only it not get worse , next morning , it completely gone ! plus , portion pink version goes breast cancer research if you buy it company ( not sure amazon ) there 30-day money back guarantee . all all , great product	1
magnet solid , frame wiggle perfectly make it clic fit just like picture shows . lenses clear functional . however , they need give bit more space accomodate larger heads , since it get snug this not your usual glasses . notice frame encircles head , making head size issue . plus side- glasses won't fall off when you bend forward , they stay around your neck after you unclick ' em , they functional	1
i fibromyalgia my heating pads my closest friends . : ) seriously , this best heating pad ever . i think best part it strap stretches -- works great neck/shoulders well hip/low back . because it flexible it doesn't " crimp " up like regular heating pads when you them bent even slightly . i am purchasing my second one now so i use two once--they're simply best heating pad there ! :	1

i looking through amazon try find straightner similar this one because i couldnt find this exact one but once i found it i bought it immediately .... my cousin this one i would go her house use it every once while but now i got my own i remember why i wanted one so bad .... so ... straight point-heats up fast-straightens hair like ... " woah " -its plates big so it more less time-has high heat settings-the only thing bugs me smell ... it smells like metal .. but im guessing its because its new cuz my cousins doesnt smell like it ... anywho great product work every cen	1
i love this flat iron ! i never used something made my hair so straight ! it heats up very quickly straightens my thick , curly hair 15-20 minutes , record time comparison other hair straighteners . buy this product , it not waste money	1
only one air brush . so this one best , but it nothing compare , working just fine last 4 month	1
this great green addition every morning . it kept me getting sick gives me energy . i mix it apple or crangrape juice it tastes great .	1
this best flat iron i've ever ! it even keeps my hair shiny straight humid weather . i don't use hair products came it because they smell like men cologne , but i love flat iron	1
this long lasting item . i bought one used 10 years ago it still works just fine . if i find where my son put it , because he loves play it . also it works best small items , like candy wrapers when your trying clean up yard . it large items like cans also . avoid one folds if you , because there really no need fold it up . just find some place hang it nail .	1
i bought set- hair dryer flat iron . this far worthwhile investment . i deliberated few years over spending this much now i wish i it earlier ! it takes five minutes dry my hair dryer so quiet never feels hot . my hair smoother too- no flyaways . flat iron amazing ! i get little flippy ends i could not get my cheap drugstore flat iron . truly worth money	1
i got this item gift christmas my son i love it . it everything it says it . i would highly recomend this product .	1
i job last nineteen years requires me stand my feet majority my workday . recently , i noticed end my shift my feet hurt more than usual . they began throb . two weeks ago i decided purchase whirlpool foot spa similar one salon where i get my pedicures . i wanted pamper rejuvenate my arhing feet home my own convenience without added cost going nail shop . my criterion : ( 1)water level deep enough immerse my ankles , ( 2)powerful water jets , ( 3)a heating element would enable water stay heated periods up two hours . aqua-jet foot spa met all my requirements . addition , handles make it very easy move lift spa when full . this unit bit more expensive than other foot spas market , however , well worth money	1
three girls household , one organizer rack not enough ! this takes away clutter three bottles , gives you place hold your razor where it slip out all time , allows you convenience not open close caps your hair products trying retrieve them you're trying shower . it nice clean look well . only downside , mirror fogs . but , overall , i'd recommend it anyone	1
two young girls who seem go through bath products like water ... this little baby already paid iteself cutting down my shampoo , conditioner bath gel bills ! i used bath products every couple weeks , kids ( 5 8 ) would go through handfuls product when using bottles they came -- now they pump enough job we waste much , much less . i purchased inexpensive dispenser lowes girls ' tub area -- but after only 2 months springs pump began rust everything pumped out yucky rust colored- so i replaced it genuine ' dispenser ' brand ( same brand i seen hotels ) i one dispenser more than year no problem , two more nearly 4 months am very heppy them . now , we one every shower tub house . truly great product !	1
i love read bed before going sleep , but propping pillows not comfortable i wanted . this really great because you enjoy heated back massage same time . concentrated light great - doesn't disturb my husband	1
lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans aquis very soft , absorbant , they dry quickly . " diva darling " hair towels not quite nice . hair turbans stay neatly your head more convenient than big fluffy towel . if turban gets sopping wet , means it doing its job ! my parents taught me it impolite come breakfast without towel covering my wet hair . this turban not only great home , but also college dorms .	1
bought 12 these several(9 ? ) years ago wife , daughter , sister , sisters-in-law , mother-in-law nieces . i think 8 survived . everyone thinks i am santa ! want new ones	1
i told my sinus surgeon take hot , steamy shower each morning . i am bath person my shower doesn't make much steam , anyway . i searched suitable alternative . all i found locally cosmetic type steamers . search amazon turned up mabis steam inhaler . it puts out large amounts steam . amount temperature steam easily adjusted . machine easy use compact . steam easily directed where desired . not wimpy , facial machines found local pharmacies . but , it used facials well lot more steam output than most . easy use clean , works great . one my best purchases ever !	1
bubbles great , but heater not even keep really hot water warm . water cooled down cold 5 minutes	-1
not accurate all . users saying they would get reading , step out step back get same reading . because there some sort memory ( probably saves it few seconds ) . i tried it taking reading , then taking reading 1 lb book my hands . it gave me same reading before . other hand , it pretty cheap it looks good	1
what i ordered arrived sooner than i expected , it well wrapped just they way i expected it . thank yo	1
this shaver better than any i long time . i skeptical because it cheaper than others i , but it works like charm me	1
i looking something less abrasive than regular manual toothbrush i tend agressive brusher . i very pleased this product my first try electronic toothbrushes . it compact i've never problem it holding charge . refills bit expensive but same case all sonic refills across board	1
i found this flosser convenient alternative traditional dental floss , however , i still prefer cleaning power traditional waxed dental floss . people braces this such nice tool easily get teeth long your teeth aren't too cramped . my son uses this it good job , although i've tried it , it not something i purchasing myself . it cheap price , however , i would recommend giving it try . each disposable flossing heads used least couple times if desired . my only complaint you cannot choose color unfortunately my teenage son received girl color : purple ! ** update ** my sons dentist said this flosser irritating his gums . he change his flossing tip daily so i only assume it vibrating motion his gums don't like . we since switched regular waxed floss , good quality brand called glide , his gums feel better .	1
i just wanted write review huggies diapers general because really bad review below . my son , they only diapers work well -- no leaking ever , while pampers sieve him driving us crazy . we also problems other brands . however , i know other parents opposite problem -- pampers work well while huggies leak . it all just based shape your particular child . i apparently huggies child nothing else . he very slender maybe that why . maybe pampers better stockier kids . i don't know . anyway , just wanted throw my two cents huggies since they wonder diaper us	1
this superior humidifier ; it quiet , humidifies room quickly , easy use clean . i would recommend , any humidifier , you empty out tank let it dry daily , so prevent buildup . but so far , we've used it month seen no buildup . one best features digital readout lets you see how much humidity room . it more expensive than your average humidifier you might buy target or cvs , but it so much better last much longer .	1
i always great experience buying amazon . however , this time , i very bad luck . product arrived factory direct no receipt . this would not issue if product wasn't defective . unfortunately , i got faulty humidifier leaked all over my floor . i could not easily send it back , since i didn't receipt . very frustrating	-1
i bought 12 these 4 years ago .. use exclusively mole chaser devices ( slow continuous drain ) . recently surprised they've started lose charge within days , even fail charge ( accu charger ) .. not quite " charge over 1000 times " i sold . over four years , i recharge them every once month .. which works out 48 times before they gave up ghost . buy more these things , until reading other reviews seeing other hi-end rechargeables ( ie maha ) . not sure what i'll next	1
i looking something like this because my wife always asking me scratch her head . after reviewing many options i picked this particular model it worked out perfectly , she loves it . vibrating tings ( tongs ? ) really give her scalp deep massage , she use it herself ( or i drive her ) . design also nice , arms rotate so whole unit pretty flat ( good packing ) since they're copper they bent fit any head shape or size . overall very worthwhile investment , recommended anyone looking head scratcher / massager	1
this fountain so beautiful , lighting dancing against wall , reflecting water . however , after 5 months , light burned out then motor quit . but price , i still think it good deal , i am buying	1
price great scale works fine . occasionally we get error message instead weight , but just step off back it works fine . i would recommend this scale	1
fits nicely into decor our full bath-very nutral color . compact easy storage . seems consistant accurat	1
i bought this drown out noise while my baby sleeps it just . although , i wish now i gotten sound machine more options , or different variety - some you even combine different sounds customize your own . i really only use " rain " sound . i would like " ocean " sound except there loud seagulls background , i'm afraid they'll wake my baby , since i turn machine up loud enough mask outside noise . other sounds heartbeat , waterfall , summer night , rainforest . my baby seemed like heartbeat sound , but i sleep same room it kept me awake - me it sounds more like someone beating drum . waterfall doesnt sound like much all - just your basic static white noise sound , other two nice background ambiance , but they dont drown out anything . i gave this 4 stars though , because it works what i bought it , sound quality great , it simple - easy use , it very portable , it battery or ac option . now i sound machine i dont know how i got without one - especially baby household barking dogs	1
while thinking which shaver set buy we came across body bare shaver set . we ordered item came us quickly . my wife tried it out could not believe how well it actually worked . after she shaved she waited 30 minutes there no discomfort or burning feeling . smooth skin last . waht great product ! larry	1
water pik sinus attachment only thing given me relief i need . living midwest you need help your sinsus problems . thank you water pik helping me	1
i purchased this set attachments " waterpik new professional ultra dental water jet " amazon last week . these tips not work this waterpik . base tip , end inserted into waterpik handle , too small . both tips this set too small . not really worth sending back amazon so i think i'll just use my trusty dremel tool some plastic cement swap base one tips came waterpik	-1
shave very close comfortable . cleaning soap water great . haven't tried wet shave yet . trimmer not seem great mustaches , motor seems running fast clean cut	1
it everything you said it would	1
i live condo very , very small washer dryer , so i don't room or time much laundry . regular towels , i only put three washer , it ends up taking 2 hours wash dry them ! these towels perfect apartment-style living ! i throw this towel washer ton room all other things i need washed , too ! absorbancy factor great , my hair not frizzy after keeping my hair wrapped towel , it pretty soft . my husband i very thin , so i thought this size towel would great drying off , but unfortunately , they barely wrap around our bodies enough tie them side wear them around house . so , i would use these towels baby towel or very large hand/face towel instead bath towe . i'll definitely buy larger one future	1
this towel great . i received it gift , love it . it really dry my hair quicker than traditional towel , result , means much less blow drying time . not only i get ready faster , but my hair starting look healthier due less blow-drying . my only complaint would it doesn't hold turban very well . but it definitely worth purchase , regardless !	1
i need unscented dryer sheets . i used bounce free , but they very difficult find . i googled unscented dryer sheets found all free clear dryer sheets ( i use all free clear small mighty detergent ) . i surprised find all made dryer sheets . anyway , i ordered them amazon ( fantastic price ) they great !!	1
this only dryer sheets i use since i such sensitive skin . it wonderful product alot less itching it	1
i love this curling iron . i gets hot very fast doesn't leave those creases your hair . it also got rid frizziness . it one cheapest which always plus	1
pretty decent trimmer , easy use it pack punch ; but most amazing quality how quite it ! very good price , very solid construction . could not ask better hair trimmer .	1
good value price . other wahl clipper offer i or 2 more pieces which usless charge abour 5 bucks more , but clipper same . so far clipper works well . i'm only one using it i'm satisfied	1
i purchased product similar bikini touch use facial hair removal ( eyebrow upper lip ) . i not like it . i paid more it it kept breaking . bikini touch works eyebrow upper lip held together nicely . i not used it bikini area nor i want . i like this product . it exactly what i wanted it not break	1
reviewer below mentioned , this device neither shaves nor removes hair around bikini area , but instead seems trim it down small point . this ok if all you want not long hairs creeping around , but i expecting much smoother result , this thing doesn't cut it ! i very dark hair , it still visible after trimming , plus it hardly seemed touch thicker hairs ! where this work quite well my upper thighs , where hair lighter finer , but i other things remove hair there ! all-in-all , i'm disappointed this device wouldn't recommend it place waxing , epilating , or just plain shaving	1
my daughter i both enjoyed soaking our feet . i guess previous reviewers overly high expectations . yes , you fill it hot water . big deal . then it ten minutes relaxation . it splash over sides if you overfill . most difficult part using this product fill it water then carry unit your seat	1
all women agree this cologne best ever . smell very distinct definite turn !	1
contrary previous post , i numerous occasions when i approached question , ' what you wearing ? ' . this amazing scent , pleasant mix subtleness reserved masculinity . course , fragrances dont always react person chemistry way they would . i'd say try small bottle when compliments start coming , then you buy larger bottle	1
tastes better than most candy bars no refined sugar or artificial ingredients	1
its sooo good . yummy , filling , natural . what more could you ask	1
after five children , i tried every diaper market one time or . each child required different diaper except my last two girls , they both able wear luvs without leaks . my now 9 month old son different story . he grew out size three diapers end his seventh month . he started crawling around luvs cut into his upper thighs they leaked . bought these size 4 now we all happy . no red marks anywear no leaks !!! i just wish i would ordered diapers through amazon starting five years ago ... it so cost effective it great them brought my front door my friendly ups driver . what great deal !!	1

i recently moved into new apartment dismayed find tiny , wall-mounted showerhead unit . i quickly made my way amazon purchased this item , decision which i applaud myself daily . settings great , it amazingly powerful , plastic seating showerhead not issue . unless you plans hang heavy , metal objects showerhead , i see no reason not purchase this product .	1
i ordered this brushed nickel version although massaging feature weak , i really like most settings . i very large stand alone shower stall so it nice take this off wall spray down entire shower this very long cord . i think massaging feature would work better if i remove flow meter comes pre-installed reduce water waste . instructions detailed how so , so if you like true shower massage , this may work you increasing amount water flow	1
i used wonder how i could get my hair look just like when i leave beauty salon . now i . i getting so much compliments my hair since i using farouk chi turbo big 2 inch ceramic flat iron hair straightener . it leaves my hair shining without adding any additional hair sheen like i ued . my sister ceramic iron maxi but it use tear my hair out . i love my iron ... it worth investment .	1
my couusins this product but instead 2 " they only 1 " i loved it when they tried it myself i wanted get one christmas . christmas came no chi straightener lot money my brother gave me amazon gift cift card . i loked weeks something spend but not much good . then week after i found this straightener sale i begged if i could buy it since i hot tool sucks badly because they heated slowly it takes long time straighten my hair . after trying my cousins ' iron i decided buy it . well i'll give u some tips before u think buying this ... #1 if u thin hair go 1 " chi straightner(works great my cousins who thin hair ) , #2 if u really thick curly wavy hair u should buy 2 " yurself , #3 i read other reviews safety conditions i bought it fast possible because i wanted buy this before sale over so u should read customers reviews check safety conditions(some said iron won't heat up after week or so but my cousins ' iron still work perfectly ) , #4 if u really thick hair u should start under yur hair until it yur whole hair(works me :) ! ) #5 don't leave it out when u take shower since it so expensive customers complains repair price . b-t-w i really thick , wavy hair it always frizzy even morning when i took shower night before so now i pull it up into low pony it looks so straight when i took rubber off but i rather straighter hair this chi . so follow my tips if u buying this curly/thick/wavy/frizzy hair this chi make great impression yur hair it lays straight until u wash yur hair . so buy this join world beauty !!	1
this my third waterpik it quietest yet . all units i worked well my dentist agrees . i would rated this unit 5 if it not fact prior units water hoses both wore out started leaking . it costs almost much new unit replace them . both previous units , hose wore out where it connects nozzle these units you replace both hose nozzle	1
used this prroduct 3 months . not find it demished lines but very rich but not greasy . great moisturizer	1
excellent product ; feels great hand , performs reliably . however , cord miserably stiff . i replaced it supple rubber cord	1
overall i am satisfied this dryer . i alot hair , but it color treated so it dry side dries easily . i would not recommend this dryer someone who alot hair or hair takes awhile dry . this dryer much quieter than my last one .	1
tanita 6102 fast reliable . it typically displays result only few seconds . i tried several heart rate monitors , i found this works faster better than more expensive models . it also capable displaying higher rates than other monitors	1

all whitening products i've used , this best . however , goop inside trays doesn't spread too effectively over surface teeth instead spills out into your mouth . they would need work , especially price they charge these	1
this brush easy use , timer very helpful . i great reviews my dental hygenist since i've using oral . it priced right too	1

it true . this first cleanser i found which actually works while same time not caused my already dry skin flake . it not miracle liquid though it not make acne disappear instantly but it certainly helps over time . i using it two years now . it leaves my face feeling refreshed clean . one weird thing i noticed this all other acne cleansers first it seems work extremely well after few months use effectiveness sort trails off into normality . don't discouraged , though . continued use twice daily definitely reduces acne breakouts . me , it doesn't entirely stop them but it still helps lot . it doesn't expire over time so don't worry buy 3 pack order get good price . i use up one tube 1.5 2 months	1

i damaged my old syncro , since it beyond warranty , i decided get new one after long period shaving blade razors ( getting sick them ) . i fair amount research find " best " razor based user comments/ratings , online reviews , etc . syncro kept coming up again again . although instructions braun tell you it may take up 30 days your beard fully adjust electric razor/syncro specifically , i impressed after first few days ! it maintains strong charge ( based amount time i use it each morning ) least week . since i travel abroad occasionally work leisure , it incredibly helpful charge cord " universal . " good thinking . compared last syncro , i noticed actual shaving head more tightly attached razor itself . screen looks ( feels ) more durable comfortable , raised ridges side razor seem bit more pronounced therefore much easier grip . shaver very easy clean , various settings adjustments make it incredibly versatile useful edging around sideburns getting those tough spots under your nose your neck . great product - i'll recommending this everyone	1
that low-power or charge-level indicator . when it running out charge , it starts out ok , then dies during shave . that annoying . my old braun lcd charge level display . i've getting 5 shaves per charge , so i just remember charge it periodically . oh , when removing protective cover , it tends pop up shaving head , drop shavings . otherwise , i like it , getting nice close shaves , smooth operation , good trimmer edge , comfortable	1

i bought this because i sick tripping over all different shampoos conditioners i like trade off . i like able switch back forth , but hated pick which ones would " lucky " shower versions , which would put under sink . it always turned out i'd way too many bottles shower then i found this ! what perfect solution . not only it store all what i'm using , but if you're one those parents who always find yourself saying your children , " what you doing .... drinking shampoo ??? " . it dispenses perfect amount , though i paid twice this much somewhere else , i'd it again heart beat . its neat , its compact , it works perfectly . i'm frankly thinking giving it gift those up coming events i'm not sure what they need or want . update : i've this few months now , savings shampoo more than paid it . it dispenses just right amount , results big savings .	1

bayer name-brand aspirin . any brand-name drug cost least double equivalent generic aspirin . i give this one-star rating not because it poor product , rather , because it so expensive . dosage 325 mg , taken two time , normal dose . aspirin wonder-drug , very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication hit market over 100 years ago . it mild moderate pain treats many different conditions such arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets not adhere each other , thus it " thins " blood prevents blood clots forming . aspirin thus used emergency treatment heart attacks strokes . some folks take " baby " aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day prevent blood clots forming . aspirin actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter structure aspirin slightly grant it different properties terms its digestion , make digestion easier . some buffer it antacids while others coat tablet coating prevents its digestion stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings tolerated most people , but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset . these folks , buffered form god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out favor 60 70 when reye syndrome developed some children ( under age 16 ) who took aspirin while they flu and/or chickenpox . 30% children affected died many more permanent brain damage . because reye syndrome , alternate analgesics placed market , premier tylenol . there no reason fear using aspirin if you adult , reye syndrome only occurred children under 16 years age . usual dose aspirin 350 mg , " extra-strength form 500 mg . most adults easily tolerate dose 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours maximum daily dose 5,200 mg . ( some rheumatoid arthritis take up 7200 mg/day doctor supervision ) . there no additional benefit taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours . increasing dose beyond this point only increase toxicity aspirin . aspirin should avoided people taking blood-thinning medications , those stomach ulcers , used caution insulin-dependent diabetics . allergies develop aspirin well . never mix aspirin any non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , such ibuprofen , there no pain benefit gastric upset chance greatly increased . don't mix aspirin alcohol either , it hard stomach . used properly , aspirin terrific medication . i prefer buy my aspirin generic form . one pays more aspirin if it produced name-brand manufacturer . however , big-manufacturers also package aspirin some buffered forms some people tolerate better . jim " konedog " koenig	-1
involved healthcare almost 20 years i know too well what impact poor diet your health . my own father , meat potatoes man , diagnosed colon cancer almost two years ago . his physician recommended he increase his intake fruit , vegetables , beans whole grains . needless say he ignored this advice . i able convince him least add dose metamucil every day . he mixes it his orange juice claims he can't even tell it there . thankfully , we not reoccurrence colon cancer . if you going eat diet deficient fruit , vegetables beans whole grains , least add little metamucil your diet . your lipid levels ( cholesterol ) colon thank you . just certain follow directions not take metamucil same time you take any medications . also , certain increase your fluid intake when you begin taking metamucil make certain it doesn't effect causing constipation . i view metamucil insurance policy your continued good health .	1
this may best tasting supplement ever . there no funky protein taste or after taste . i mix it water it tastes like very good chocolate milk . i couldn't give it perfect marks because it little hard mix . i use shaker always least little clumping . but taste so good i don't really mind .	1

i owned this product past few months . i love brush sizes they interchangeable . great tool loosening curly hair softer look . quick curl-release great . it also several temperature settings . . . low/high heat cool setting curl . barrels also cool down fairly quickly after use . my only complaint plastic power switch . it pops off times tempermental making connection start-up switching temperature settings . it may just my unit or could flaw product . check out switch before purchase , if possible . i paid only $17.00 + tax walmart . i am looking similar product same features but sturdier construction . this one not worth $30+ .	1
i used this shaver over 3 years no problems all . i found wet shave ( lather up ) gives best results both under-arm area legs . use pop up trimmer longer hair- hair just glide under foil if you try shave without it . course its not close blade- because its not blade . my only complaint it costs much replace cutters ( which come new foil well ) it buy new razor	1
while i'd used swiffer before , i hadn't used wet cleaning pads before today i blown away ! original swiffer sweeper makes quick job sweeping , especially dust hair , which leave your floors bare mopping becomes much cleaner less hassle free job . mopping cloths put swiffer sweeper same manner dry cloths . they're extremely similar except these , obviously , wet soaked cleaning solution . also , mopping cloths little scrubbing edge ( which i found i didn't even use ) . i've used swiffer wet jet which made especially mop but think i prefer this method . like regular mop , cleaning solution already pad ( or sponge traditional sense ) compared sot wet jet where you spray it often cannot see exactly where it goes . also , regular swiffer sweeper made metal components , compared plastic handle wet jet , feels much more sturdy while it still light weight . this allows you scrub little harder , little more " elbow grease " than wet jet . mopping pads also feel like they're more secure swiffer sweeper stay still better . velcro adhesion wet jet doesn't seem this way thinner mopping pads just good job wet jet pads , without coming apart like wet jet pads often , feeling like diaper or taking up much room . my 3 small rooms , 1 mopping pad almost , but not quite , trick . it easy scrub off spots wet mopping pads actually took care few spots wet jet left previously , not matter how hard i scrubbed . i'm shocked i've never used this product before - it great i would recommend it anyone . i bought mine stores didn't deal messy shipping but i would never purchase wet product like this through mail or online ; it much more convenient simply buy it store .	1

while discs little difficult get them adhere , especially tongue , they really lessen duration severity these horribly painful canker sores . i hope this product stays around forever	1
after spending full week pain , point where 6-8 advil day made little difference , i read reviews this product ( different size , http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0002m50yw/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_1/104-9592068-8075113?%5fencoding=utf8v=glancen=3760901 ) decided give it try . box says it works best prevent sores forming , but it worked wonders my fully-developed canker sore , which size dime inside my lower lip , sliced through middle so nerve endings exposed -- ( sorry ; i know that really gross , but seriously , it excruciating ) . after 2 hours i felt numbing relief ; after 6 hours i could tell canker sore started heal over ; few hours after , sore developed protective blister-like covering over it , i could actually eat solid foods again after week starbucks jamba juice ( boy i hungry cranky this week , esp . since even drinking through straws hurt ) . i diligent putting discs consecutively , using 5-6 10 hours -- amazing recovery well worth it . this product actually heals canker sores . last product i used ( orabase colgate ) actually aggravated sore because it essentially like applying nail glue raw surface -- incredibly painful traumatic when it dislodged , which it after 30 minutes best . note : cankermelts not liquid , but necco wafer-like discs , ranging 3/8 " 5/8 " diameter . some may find them bit awkward manuveur first , esp . if your sores pretty small , but i encourage you read directions carefully , give them shot . addition actually healing sores , active ingredient these licorice root , not 2-octyl cyanoacrylate ( aka nail glue ) like orabase . i'll take mild licorice taste over toxic glue any day . whoever invented this product deserves medal , or , very least ( seeing no " healer disgusting canker sores " medal exists ) , sell billion these . i'm stocking up them like cold-eeze	1

i tried many types ear plugs these best . they made out soft silicon , so you mold them fit your ear . stay put comfortable . foam-type ear plugs tend pop out , they very scratchy me . non-moldable rubber-y ones even worse ; they hurt my ears don't block out sound very well . " mack earpillows " waterproof , so you swim without getting water your ears . ( good swimming bathing children who " tubes " their ears , too ) . your sleep-environment dead quiet ( except those little voices your head ! ) normal room . if you dealing partner-snoring , people watching tv room , or like , " mack " masks much , too . very handy travel . only drawbacks i know fact they don't kill all noise ( nothing ) , they don't last forever ( nothing either . ) you throw them away when they get dirty , but if you keep them case , they'll stay clean quite while . sometimes i pick hair out them after i wake up because my hair tends get caught them when i sleep , which annoying . everything sticks them , so , if they fall floor , they end up looking like nasty boogers	1

i got this gift love it !! 2 my kids small ear canals frequent ear infections so we not use ear thermometer ( you can't use it kids under 1 anyway ) . waiting rectal reading squrimy baby challengei shocked read bad reviews site . my husband some problems first ( like these people complaints ) but i figured out he pulling it away our kids head still holding down button second , which then adding calculations room temperature . depending how long he continued hold it down after pulling it away , it really made temperatures flucuate . my readings would only vary . 1- . 2 degrees . so practice couple times when you first get it . ( across forehead , down temple stop infront ear ) . before you pull it up , let go button !!!. it beep soon you let button go your reading . it takes some practice really quick ( our peditricion super quick , but they practice dozens times day ) . if forhead sweaty you also just hold it second or so behind ear , but again wait beep before pulling away . our kids don't min	1

braun irt 4520 ear thermometer excellent device taking temperatures , especially small children infants . most families oral thermometer some use other types , like rectal or those placed under armpit . these other thermometers generally ok certain age groups but when it comes very young , ear thermometer best option . braun irt 4520 one best market . this thermometer gives accurate results 30 45 seconds . they way it accomplishes its task using infrared technology measure level heat generated eardrum other tissue . some may question ear accurate place measure ones ' body temperature but according many medical experts , ear actually provides greater accuracy than oral other types thermometers . all pluses this device , most important among them ease use . babies generally don't like anything placed inside their ears but they don't resist this type thermometer like they others . i tried using armpit style thermometer but squirming crying too much . this , there still little bit annoyance both your baby you but it nothing compared aggravation caused other types thermometers . occasion , this thermometer may problem producing accurate measurement when it , it let you know display panel . example , if tip isn't inserted properly ear , you get error code " pos " , indicating positioning not secure . if surrounding air too hot or too cold ( needs 50 104 degrees fahrenheit ) , you get " err " error message . if person temperature far too high or too low , ( outside 93.2 108 degrees fahrenheit range ) you get " hi " or " lo " . if this happens , don't panic- chances you didn't insert thermometer correctly or filter isn't clean . replace filter if necessary try again . one many nice things this device it comes complete batteries . this may not seem like big deal but it no fun when you buy new electronic device , race home , discover you forgot batteries . braun knows when people buy thermometer , it usually because they need use it immediately . they don't want unexpected surprise no batteries . braun includes these your convenience . fact batteries ordinary aa also convenient because this type battery easy find . yet plus this thermometer it stores last temperature memory . this temperature display when you turn unit , allowing you see last reading compare it reading you take . this nice because it takes guesswork out task . often , pediatrician ask if you know previous temperature so he/she make comparisons check progress case illness . this device , it right there , panel when you turn it . when you take new temperature , reading remains screen sixty seconds your convenience . could this thermometer improved any way ? well , i only think few minor things . one would gripping surface- perhaps small section around middle rubber covering help consumers hold device more firmly place . possible improvement would lighted display panel , just case you need use thermometer dark place . these other changes could make thermometer even more appealing , but they minor shouldn't count much buying decision . keep things sanitary possible , it important always replace lens filter before each use . this small plastic cap fits over tip measuring device it needs replaced after each use . these replacement filters purchased most drug stores on- line cost less then ten dollars pack forty . this added cost owning this type thermometer . but any type thermometer going include its share cleaning/sanitation costs so , again , this shouldn't too much affect one decision buy . overall , this thermometer proven itself godsend me my family . ease use , memory storage last temperature reading , long battery life ( two years or 1000 measurements ) make this must anyone babies or toddlers . it eliminates much fussiness frustration common other thermometers even though it carries hefty price tag , it worth extra cost .	1
i love this thing !! i made fresh salsa everyday . i no trouble chopping onions . you need slice onion using slices 1/4 " 1/3 " thick . carrots need sliced half . it great dicing onions cooking . even celery diced . i would recommend highly !	1
i only used it once it broke ( made out cheap plastic) ! it sure " one time use only " way it shown tv not way you really use it , not so smoothly - i think they used already chopped onion . i would say it better soft vegetables such tomatoes ( which also very messy because juice ) . it just waste money . i wouldn't recommend it anyone .	-1

overall i would say this straighterner very good product . i straightening my hair almost 10 years , this far best straightener i used . plates smooth glassy ( ceramic all ) they heat up evenly great job . also because they so smooth not get hot spots scorched or burnt , any residue styling product so easily cleanable ( i used major problems cleaning gunk off my metal plated straighteners ) . i used numerous other straighteners snagged ( spaces plates ) , broke damaged my hair , since using this my hair looks so much healthier i fewer split ends less heat damage . my only regret when i bought this i not realize it came 2 inch size , which i most certainly would purchased instead since 1 inch size so small takes longer use ( reason missing star ) . i highly recommend this product even more than some straighteners i bought beauty supply stores .	1
my wife uses it every day ! compact easy storage travel . easy use . heats up quickly . rollers hold hair well . right number rollers each size .	1
my son broad shoulders hip muscular legs -- like both his father me -- so we go one size larger than his weight no matter what diaper we . these stay him ! which amazing because he very active ! it would nice if sides more flexable . he two already doing handstands . sometimes they split when he lifts his legs up	1

i usually not take time review items , but i make exception theracane . this one best things i bought myself it affectionately dubbed " boyfriend " due amount timne i spend it . getting your mind out gutter , i could barely move when i purchased this . i prior experience similar device years ago . one my friends given our nfl team i loved it wanted one , but never gotten around getting it . enter high stress job where i travel every weekend . sitting plane hours time sleeping different 4 different beds 12 nights month started wreaking havoc my body . not mention , i'm fairly intense begin . i love this thing because i get there use much pressure i am comfortable . i like hard pressure most massage therapists can't get muscle like i theracane . after week 3 times day theracane use trigger point therapy book , i felt like new person . my back shoulders relaxed , i found places my legs arms very painful some work , i now move more freely . cane very sturdy , i'm sure one could break it , but it would take some effort . i knocked myself upside head it while trying out different ways using it , it bit awkward . however , there little booklet comes it gives you ideas also there dvd you buy , but i no idea what . i use it working computer , watching tv , after gym , road ( it fit 25 " rolling suitcase diagonal angle . ) my real boyfriend uses it he not like strong pressure use little he likes , my work partner also purchased after my rave reviews it i most likely it me when i visit family get them hooked it too	1

photograph this product very misleading ! i thought i would receive 4 soaps shown photo , but i only got one i didn't even get choose which dinosaur i wanted inside . soap itself very sticky feels homemade . homemade isn't necessarily bad thing except here i'm not sure whether i trust ingredients , especially since soap really not very pleasant smelling .	1
don't tend write reviews ever , but let world know this one try prevent other people buying this product . bought it when it just came market few months ago lot more money than other epilators comparison . i've used braun many years but thought i'd invest into new one hoping new technologies would less painfull more efficien t.t his epilator definitely less painfull , but unfortunately more reason not pulling out any hair than any other reason . tried it several ways , dry , wet , shaving cream , soap , long hair , shortened hair ..... managed get maybe 50% hair out after going over it hundred times . consequently i've use it every day get all hair out over time , still hoping i'd get used it . but here i am , finally giving up , looking new epilator most likely go back braun . what big disappointment ! don't fall fancy bits	-1

great blow dryer . nice quiet , blow drys my hair quickly . definitely reduces frizz over regular blow dryer . only reason i can't give it 5 stars because it claims 4 different heat settings , 3 different air speeds .... what it doesn't mention low , med hi fan settings heat settings can't set independently each other . so hi fan also gives you hi heat ! digital display cute ... but useless .	1

i love this sunscreen ! i got some my dermatologist , i looking high spf sunscreen especially my face . i noticed there blue lizard face lotion well , but i just used regular . i love it ! i no problems far breakouts . it takes little bit rub because its high spf ( it lotiony , just really opaque ) but it worth it , because job like no other sunscreen i've tried . since effects last longer than average sunscreen , so you use less . plus bottle turns bright blue when sun rays dangerous , which i find pretty cool . i really feel protected this sunscreen beach . i like its light scent . price reasonable too	1
it works ! it so important buy it recycled - saves those trees	1
my own experience nizoral first time you use it ( after not using it while or not using it ever before ) , you get increase flakes . it almost if it loosening up ridding your scalp everything already there . after , continued use , it amazing . i find only after using it two or three times , i stop ... sometimes weeks , sometimes months , without reacurring dandruff ! so don't scared after first shampoo all these huge flakes show up . i wish it smelled little nicer , but it small price pay results !	1
excellent works like breeze . first anti dandruff shampoo actually worked me	1
this hair dryer works wonderfully . i only gave it 4 stars because comb attachment falling off bit . not big problem , except it hot ! course , perhaps it falling off because user error	1

concept cute , although size makes it bit difficult store when you not wearing them , but main problem they give you hat hair , compressing your hairstyle band surrounds your head . regular glasses go hairs , so everything fluffs out . if you never take off your reading glasses , buzz cut , bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head ( but careful buns ) , clic connect reader may fine you . otherwise , conventional glasses better bet	1
i purchased these after seeing physician friend mine using them . i absolutely recommend these any active person who needs reading glasses ready . i clip them morning use them off throughout day never misplace them . i purchased these gifts other professional people . one pair i purchased bit narrow temples . i heated back band hair dryer gave them little side side pull , placed them they fit just fine . if you particularly large person this may necessary	1
these glasses great idea . however , they not work long hair . back " strap " glasses ride high up back head lenses rest low nose ( so you see over them distance ) . long hair lays back glasses pushes them down back , making front glasses pop up placing lenses right front eyes . i guess most people who need reading glasses don't long hair	1
[ hey , my first amazon review ! ]i bought this shaver some weeks ago . this first time i've tried wet dry type shaver , i gotta tell ya , i love it !! my previous one braun ( i prefer single head shavers ) normal dry shaver , if i wanted really close shave it left my skin little sore extra friction . but washing little soap water just before using this shaver , i get beard that soften up little washing , then this shaver glides over soapy lather like silk !! my shave close every time , my face * very * happy i found this shaver . there bonus me . it faint buzz you hear over normal hum when it actually cutting off hairs , so i tell when i'm shaved clean just sound shaver . works great cleaning up those few die hard hairs my balding pate where i can't see - no buzz = no stubble . i just came back buy one these ( leave my travel kit - i keep it fully equipped so i just grab it go ) . i read review again mach 3 guy i just put my 2 cents , since i disagree him so strongly . fwiw , i notice he doesn't mention this shaver explictly , just touts mach 3 . hmm , i wonder if he really tried this shaver	1

i lighted makeup mirror years can't imagine not one , so when one lights started go out i began my search . i came across this mirror started reading reviews . i concerned because price soooo good i thought it too good true . i almost not buy it when i read lights difficult or times not turn but i threw caution wind there seemed far more positives , i'm glad i ! i say when i first set it up i could not get lights come felt sick feeling but i held button down second or two then released it tapped it again we lights ! wonderful bright lights they ( kind scary ) i guess i really needed this mirror while ago ;-) . i love stand different positions but i really like mirror swivels vertically instead horizontally thus letting me adjust it even more . 5x magnification clear really great doing my eyebrows . far side mirrors , i haven't really used those yet ( my other not them ) that not say time i won't . i'm just not used them . my only concern i don't problem lights month now , so i'm keeping my fingers crossed . i absolutely love everything this mirror i would buy it again i think it worth giving it try	1

many new bath/shower products come pretty interesting ( specious ) ingredients ( like mango-guava essence tea-bark oil , make up few ) . according labelling , these things some pretty miraculous things : tighten , illuminate , add bounce , lift separate ! ahem . anyway , my point this particular gel claims contain " electrolytes " " invigorate " " awaken " skin . i skeptical first , but pleased find , fact , it stimulating scrub . eye-opening effects might more gel clean , non-cloying limeade scent than any mystical ingredients , but whatever case , it works	1
use this when you want come back life gel smells good too gel awaking invigorating electrolytes work well	1
everyone my family owned these clic goggles . my original pair gave out after three years use . i ordered these because they said " standard size " they normally come small medium large . well , i am medium standard size large ( same my husbands ) . i tape them back make them smaller so i could wear them . not time return .... very disappointed . consider this before ordering you again .	1

sometimes i get terrible " jumpy legs " after i go bed night , making it hard fall asleep . i saw this thought it worth try , it really works . within 30 minutes after taking it , my leg cramps disappear . i've found out several my sisters friends suffer " jumpy legs " too , they found relief hylands leg cramps . quinine very mild muscle relaxer - i don't feel drugged or light-headed , just relieved . these tablets taste kind sweet they dissolve really quickly under your tongue . it couldn't easier get relief ! i've also found it helps lower back pain .	1
this humidifier works great .

i don't get it . some people spend tens , hundreds dollars take care their cars , ipods digital cameras . then , go out buy pair nail clippers - cheapest ones - $ . 99 gas station . should it not other way around , i mean , it your body . last week i picked up pair these $7 my local walgreens . so far , no problems . i love them , they so sharp you make yourself bleed if you're not careful . used ' gas station shears ' i no problem doing just so . after buying subsequently throwing away countless pairs nail clippers , i decided look something absolutely not rust ! i like keep pair clippers shower , my sink , porcelain covered metal frame , would develop brown rust spots after 1-2 days clipper left there . that when tweezerman set caught my eye , not because they made asia like all others , but because they 1 ) advertised stainless steel 2 ) guaranteed life . event i damaged them , it says here packaging they replace them 1/2 price me . ( sh not included ) . $7 new , i'm not sure if this means much , but least it says they stand product . but all it worth , price ( remember they whopping 7-10 times more expensive than regular ones ) worth paying my opinion	1

i this scale now 3 years . we use it linoleum our bathroom . first , i pretty happy it , thinking it decent scale money it seemed accurate . that until i went yearly check up . this scale weighs me my husband average 5-8 lbs . heavier than doctor scale , there no way zero-balance it . additionally , first battery it came lasted long time , only recently we see " lo " reading . we purchased package batteries recommended manufacturer this scale . 3 weeks ago , consistently , each week , i replace batteries because " lo " message appears all time ; accuracy this scale gone downhill tremendously . i know this because i weightloss regime lost 30 lbs . last 8 lbs , this scale refused show ; it just refuses move this incredibly frustrating when you're trying lose weight . second rectification occured when my husband i recently updated our life insurance ; this meant checkup doctor ( , subsequently , different scale ) . 2nd check up also revealed 5-8 lbs . weight difference than this scale shows . maybe 3 years too long expect $30 scale ; could definitely problem . regardless , i'm here amazon shopping new scale , i won't buying this one again .	1
after using my parent health o meter digital scale , this model closest similarity i could find . accuracy seems good ( cat weighed 11.8 lbs ., which right , though you could try holding test weight ) , which useful keeping airline freight under fifty pound mark . this model wider platform , so it very stable . battery compartment readily accessible , should lithium battery ever require replacement , which remedies complaint i noted reviews other models . i am quite pleased this purchase .	1

i use this trimmer without guides bring my beard down use razor . i've tried other brands only return them becuase they simply wont get close . precision good . keep your receipt , however , my blades dulled under year using it every two weeks . i however replace guide protect blades when not use . removal guides difficult but became simpler more use . i've read complaints them too cheap , but if they sturdier ( thicker ) they would not work well . it just takes little patience first few uses . i interested this trimmer because it blades you replace instead purchasing new trimmer when it becomes dull . when it came time replace them however cost averaged around $18 ( s/h ) new blades . target ( aug 20 , 2006 ) this exact razor ( complete set ) $17.99 store . tax usually less than s/h , so cautious prices you find !	1

these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

i admit when i got it realized basic idea this machine it fan ... i bit put out . but honestly , i used it last night i got best sleep i years . we usually keep fan our ac going or run actual fan which dries your sinuses out makes you cold . this little machine doesn't sound blocks out lot outside noise . i don't think i going anywhere without it anytime soon . i am thrilled so glad i spent money it . good sleep well worth it	1
i am disbelief this thing ever got marketed . first time i attached flexible hose it would not hold up weight shower head . i tried tightening it , twisting it , you name it no good . it hangs down 30 -60 degree angle best . i thought perhaps water flowing through it things might improve . nope . just got worse . engineering team this one should fired . this product should get bonehead design year award . how heck something like this ever got produced really blows my mind . waterpik -it coming back you .	-1
first seems little pricey , but well worth it , much better than any regular pillow , if you fill it right you don't hear any water noises all , very comfortable	1
let honest , we all wear cologne because either it attracts ladies or because we want cover up our stink . this cologne great both . it strong enough last all night but not too strong where people rolling down windows car let you know they gagging . it light fruity smell bit deeper musk . appropriate business casual but more geared toward blue jeans tshirt kind rugged man . i dress more preppy , but this suits me just fine . oh , bottle lasts forever	1

i live california very fair skin ( blond hair , blue eyes ) . most sunblocks i tried not worked promised , even those recommended my dermatologist ( i've tried md forte , solaray , solbar , many others - cheap stuff expensive brands ) . i found past even when i apply 30-60 sfp sunscreens during day , i still get some color my cheeks - issue year-round sunny climates even when you going your day , driving shopping so forth , you exposed damaging sun . addition , i indulgence -- i love bicycle beach during daytime occasion . nothing worked until i tried fallene . it not miracle product ... i'm sure if i sun 8 solid hours applied this product every 2 hours , i would still get tiny amount color . however , waterproof fallene product works like charm 2-hour bicycle rides - seriously , i get no color , regular spf 68 product works beautifully all-day year-round protection . it first time i ever satisfied sunscreen . i like it thick , because little goes long way . i also prone break out , i no problems this product . very high quality . if you're fair-skinned , this only thing work . sure shop around internet , you get good discounts it .	1
i bought yellowbird my salon three years ago lot more money . recently heating element went bad it blew only cold air . while i very disappointed it lasted relatively short time , i decided buy one just like it b/c when i tried others ( even conair ) they seemed wimpy . this price less than 1/3 what i originally paid it . so i don't care too much if it goes three years . i've never better hairdryer	1
ive this fragrance several times before . i love it , everyone comes contact me seems love it well ( especially ladies ) . only downside it doesn't seem last more than few hours .	1
guru lite only " low calorie " energy drink i've found doesn't use artificial sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame . taste not sweet like soft drink or some other sugar laden energy drinks so it might not everyone , but i think it tastes good . i recommend you drink it cold .	1

i used whal " face shaper " 20 years . when i dropped it hard surface cast cutting blades cracked . andis 29775 headline my replacement due price especially because it claimed help grown hairs part new routine . brushing your face provided brush help ( though i doing years ) . problem andis 29775 it gets very hot even after it broken . i using it 3 months it still gets just hot when i used it first time . if you ingrown hairs , or ever dermatologist related issues , you know heat causes irritation . my mom cut hair sold make up over 30 years . she always said same thing . actually , she bought me whal face shaper swears them . needless say , i buy whal . they " never get hot " , no matter how long you run them , they cut exactly good andis . not mention if i hadn't dropped mine , it would still working perfectly after over 20 years . also , you don't need andis ' so called revolutionary face brush either . any fine beard brush " soft " brissels exact same thing . i facial skin problems all my life i am now almost 42 . so my statements come plenty exerience . i highly recommend anyone these types problems whal trimmer over andis . best regards , terry	1
i love this thing . it what it supposed , which remove hair . i don't understand people complaining it hurts , course it hurts , you're pulling hair out root . i used veet pre wax spray help some . i also suggest disinfecting device heads alcohol before use so you don't spread bacteria into hair follicle wind up pimples . i get small dots where i used this since those small red dots inflamed hair folices but they went away over night . i used this every where , face , legs , zone loved it . i haven't thrown out my razor because i shave my legs right after i use emjoy so my legs completely baby smooth . it gets my face , zone , arms baby smooth i never shaved those places . smoothness last 2 weeks then i use emjoy again since new hairs sprout up . time goes i find myself using razor less less my legs it takes few months get every hair plucked . if you epilate get all hairs root it eventually stops growing , i've waxed my underarms years prior emjoy very little hair there . great thing you emjoy whenever you want , no more waiting hair grow like waxing . all all great product small enough take you but don't let size fool you , it gets job	1
so i don't know how many guys use this but i am one . i think this painful way remove hair , but let remember you removing many hairs root ! i tried nair , waxing . so i say i know what pain . but least this pain you should get weeks smooth skin . i only just used it so i don't know how long i get or how many ingrown hairs i get . i used this my back arms just tried little my face . they say not use your face , why i don't know other than pain . i bleed few spots would break out into cold sweats while using this . anyone used any electric shaver should know they always say your skin just needs time get use it . so i am hoping thinking this case this . even what i said above i would recommend this product because it it job , i am so thankful able found this product . i think long run it worth it . because it lot cheaper than anything else . even if it breaks i buy one every year . since i spending around $50 month when i paying nair , growth inhibitor shipping . which 50 12 = 600 yr . also when it comes time it may take awhile area(s ) you chose but long run it really no time all . remember you should get least couple days or up 6 weeks smooth . my back i used nair since i not this product yet . then waited week skin heal . this helped me not long or many hairs pull . they recommend trimming hairs if it awhile since your last session . but since i couldn't reach i use nair . i am looking into extending claw hold emjoi ap-96 optimini epillator future . good luck	1

my wife got one these typically decided try it out giving me pedicure . i since learned dread sound whinning motor even more than dentist drill . unless you keep it continous motion perfect angle , rapid rotation causes friction which burns your nail ( or skin ) causes intense , sharp pain . you might well run your tool box put electric drill or dremmel sanding disk your hands feet . not throw away your money this thing unless you plan use it filing plastic or anything not atttached human .	-1

i seeing same stylist ten years . i adore her i trust her implicitly . when i asked her hair straighteners , she showed me one she uses professionally , used it style my hair . it little more expensive than offerings target or wal-mart , but she said , " you right tools . " not only she use hai stick work , but her daughters use it well . hai stick multiple settings different hair types . my hair fine but curly somewhat intractable . lowest setting not sufficient , but i found setting halfway up dial ( 260 ) works very well . because way you customize settings , this straightener suitable all hair types . it heats up ten seconds . note : all heat styling , my stylist recommended using thermal protectant . i bought tresemme thermal creations straightening gel . it works very well only costs $8 . overall , this very effective , high quality product	1
i don't even know where start , this iron absolutely amazing . i really thick , curly hair , i always wear it curly , or up ponytail , because if i tried straighten it blowdrier , no matter what kind brush i used , or what kind products i used , it would end up big poufy mess . well let me tell you , this iron exceded all my expectations , then some . i one other straightener before this one , it total letdown . but this one straightens my hair one pass , medium heat . it heats up no time , i'm very impressed it on/off switch breaker-thing if it overheats . my hair stays straight smooth through almost anything . even high humidity , you would never able tell my hair wasn't naturally straight . i've owned it 9 months , i don't think i could live without it	1
after two weeks very cool performance this thing went nuts ! it used change colors ever 15 or so seconds . now it changes colors every 2 seconds . looks like strope light . it drive you nuts ! plus , it completly soaks anything around it . you need change " towels " under it twice day ! ruin anything it sitting ( moisture damage ) . great idea but poor product . not worth 51 bucks ! amazon says they give money back . after buying hundreds amazon goodies this first thing i've got pretty much junk . not !!! just read other reviews . hope this helps	-1

i previously leg waxing salon , i really liked results , however , i didn't return because i rash reaction some product they used . i figured if i more control over products , i would better results . i bought this product starter kit , which included 4- 2 ounce bottles : ) after wax skin concealer , ) pre-hon epilation cleanser , ) slow grow reduce hair re-growth ) wax off . i read instructions , but i confused what wax . i supposed put water heating compartment then put wax container into water , or just put container there no water or should i dump contents wax container into compartment . nowhere instructions it tell me how it . i tried all three eventually dumped wax . even if this not correct , i used two occasions didn't feel it easy . wax either too thick or too thin drips or hard spread , simply impossible backs your legs yourself . wax off doesn't work easily i residual wax everywhere . after wax skin concealer just like makeup your legs i found it useless . pre hon cleanser says use it then apply powder ( which doesn't come kit ) . i didn't even try slow grow because i don't think you slow hair growth . maybe it better pay money get it professionally .	1

these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

chocoleans work suppress actual hunger ; however , they nothing " i feel like eating " feeling . i use them suppress hunger , then when i still feel like eating , i know it not real hunger but my usual food fixations . it helps me psychologically anyway , interpret my feeding feelings ! also , they work best if you not eat one hour before after taking . ( drinks don't count , doesn't seem affect anything . ) i love taste , can't tell much difference sugar-free regular ones ... sugar-free only 6 calories less . it very dark chocolate , so if you don't like dark you probably won't care	1

( yes , before you ask , i always use pre-electric shave lotion prior shaving ) . first morning i used this remington r-960 , i felt nothing out ordinary . felt pretty much like any other electric razor . 15 20 minutes after i finished shaving i began notice burning-type feeling around my neck/throat area . hour later i really felt this burning sensation . i leave work when i quick ' mirror check ' bathroom holy cow !! my neck throat area bright red all swollen ! i mean bright red swollen ! no wonder burning sensation i feeling . i looked like i just finished ( trying ) shave gas powered hedge trimmer ! i got work guys i work like " holy crap !! what happened you ? " " why , i just shaved my brand new remington r-960 this morning . why you ask " , i sarcastically replied . they said it looked like someone took chain saw my throat ! you get idea . bottom line ... it took approximately 6 days all redness swelling entirely clear up my neck/throat area . needless say , morning which first time i used my new remington r-960 electric also last time i used it . i haven't touched it since . frankly if i may honest here , i'm little frightened thing now . it like it mind it own it bit me but good . now , each morning when i'm shaving my remington ms2-300 micro screen ( not triple head ) razor , i sort tendency keep one eye little monster it still sitting there shelf near sink mirror , patiently waiting next time i'm foolish enough pick it up again . you warned	1
odd fat boomerang shape , hard get access cutters , hard clean , on-off switch almost flush razor very hard turn off . shave marginal . i much prefer tne remington ta4570	1
i hesitated buying this more " basic " version when there many others more options choices . we very happy it now it here . there quieter tone stronger tone , both very soothing gentle , but perfect aiding sleep . i still hear children clearly room when they speak , too .	1
first glance , sound machine looks very outdated old , but it really great job masking noise . our son gotten used sleeping humidifier , but i tired filling it , so thought i'd try this instead it awesome ! they could work updating look , though	1
this scale lot different functions . they all help keep your weight under control . i would buy this again	1
overall i love scale . it keeps track four different people weight , let you know how much you've lost or gained daily . biggest problem i it you can't read numbers unless it light . it should light up so you see it 5:00 a.m. when it dark !!	1
this scale highly accurate . some people complain you get different reading everytime . reasons : 1 . they not balanced correctly scale . scale displays arrows so you know which way correct your balance . those people saying they get different result during day , average person ways 2-5 lbs heavier night . why ? because , you eat drink during day . you actually weigh lighter night if you just good cardio work out due all water loss . i highly recommend this product . it gives me accurate results so i gauge my progress . remember though , measurements better gauge result	1
this kit very much worth price . it easy my face feels so soft smooth , i can't keep my hands off my face afterwards	1
i'd far prefer use generic forms ibuprofen but hives extra ingredients used fillers . someone recommended liqui-gel form hives disappeared . i used generic ibuprofen years alleviate joint pain . hives one possible side-effects ibupofen . if you experience anything unusual while using drug , check out possible side effects related it . tinitus also possible side effect ibuprofen aspirin	1

whether you microwave this blanket or not , you certainly won't disappointed . fabric unbelievably soft , weight flax seed lavender feels incredibly cozy . when warmed , it best heating pad you could ask , evenly heating soothing your sore muscles . i love it so much i'm tempted buy two sew them together make one big blanket . trust me , this item worth every penny	1
this good monitor . my only negative remark would unit pumps little too much pressure . really gets tight your arm . but ... main thing desired accuracy this unit it accurate .	1
my dad two monitors . this one more acurate consistent . this most important thing blood pressure monitor . only problem it not portable . but it good idea one your office one home such cheap price	1
i bought this hair dryer because good price i am more than happy it . i could not say if " ions " anything , but dryer what i wanted it - dry my hair reasonable amount time , it takes no quicker or longer length time than any other hair dryer . cool shot button dream , it blasts cold hair immediately finish my hair . reasonable weight size . i use this dryer every morning only reset over-heat button once , it reset straight away dryer started working immediately again . i believe price amazon this good value hair dryer buy	1

this shaver saver cleaner/ lubrication great product last while . it works best water proof/ resistant shaver . you dont need buy self-cleaning shaver if you get water proof one use shaver saver	1
glasses well made but i found them awkward use . they didn't fit comfortably it took quite bit time get them . gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well me . every head different , so maybe they'll work better you	1
i use these glasses all time work . they sure handy . glad i bought them	1
i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	1
title says it all . easy read , not disappointed any way !!! p.s. i am not affiliated this product any way ..	1
these goggles great ! they not bulky like other goggles they lot more stylish . i got lot compliments while skiing . price great too ! almost half what my local ski store sells them . without hat , smaller size fit me snugly but when i tried them hat ( since i would wearing them ski ) , i found i needed bigger size keep them popping off .	1
i just bought vespa scooter short trips since gas prices so high . i needed some eye protection would work my helmet . these goggles awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet , because wrap around my head , they stay put . magnets front very strong so goggles don't move . eye cups just right size they're padded comfort . these goggles far exceeded my expectations .	1
i ride motorcycles bicycles -- these goggles fit me great keep my eyes safe . i dry-eye , so i'm really sensitive wind goggles work like charm . they're easy take off keep around your neck no hassle it easy keep up them way . my wife loves them rollerblading . she looks fierce them , that part deal these -- they look so cool . smaller size fit her -- she couldn't wear standard size . now , what else needed ? somone else said , clear lenses nighttime would grea t--t hen one could use them saftey goggles well . interchangeable lenses would best . also , someone else mentions , they're not easy store -- they fold over puts lenses against each other . tube would make more sense than sack -- they lend themselves tube because their unique design . course , polarized much better than tinted my opinion , it worth price difference . so these great , but they could even better . i hope clic listening -- these goggles could next great thing sports eyewear	1
i tried many types brands vitamins . source life far best . i tell when i miss taking them . if i take them empty stomach , i never even gotten slightly nauseated , unlike other vitamins i've taken . these high quality , good you really raise your energy level . i highly recommed sol vitamins .	1

i found this suggestion elsewhere internet , tried it , it works great ! " i've used zelco booklights years , discovered early their bulbs burn out quickly -- no doubt nice profit source company since replacement bulbs cost dime each when bought bulk . problem four 1.5 volt batteries ( or ac adapter ) produce 6 volts , while called 6 volt bulbs , these things actually work optimally 5 volts . solution hit radio shack or similar vendor buy 7.5 volt replacement bulbs ( $1.59 2 pack ) . you get very slightly less light , but single bulb now lasted me almost 3 years nightly use , because filament bulb burning lower temperature .	1
pricey , shipped quick but well worth dough . it worked me my face jacked up plus i bumps my neck which wasnt cool . i cant say enough this stuff its good stuff	1
excellent addition my skin care regiment . this product makes my skin feel soft silky smooth . i've also converted my mother sister	1

i hesitant buying personal razor because i heard horror stories shavers past ( anyone say epilady ? ) but i tired regular razors so really ready give this new style try . ( regular razors either couldn't get close enough due safety blade , or they nicked me even when i careful . ) course , it little hard fork over money this , me , it just shaver . i could not more wrong . this shaver set awesome . cleancut shaver works wonderfully , gives great ( smooth ) result , there no chance getting cut or nicked . * only * reason i give it four stars ( i really would like give it 4.5 ) because : ) while cleancut t-handle trimmer works okay what it ( trim hair short enough shaver ) , it doesn't work great -- more private areas , i concerned i might get nicked ( although , honest , i didn't ) . ) i would like just bit larger shaving area cleancut shaver . just hair over inch wide ( maybe 1-1/8 " ) it took quite bit time cover all necessary areas . while size surely designed nooks crannies , i still think little larger surface area would worked just well also cut down shaving time . said , this product well worth money , i highly recommend it anyone . it great able get such close shave without messy shave creams , gels , or lotions ... or painful waxing	1
i used original old spice scent years wanted change . i picked up pure sport love it .... great scent lasts all day isn't over-powering . recommended	1

never worn night guard before , i very happy i ordered low profile one . i small mouth adjustable sides enabled me fit it just right . tiny strip fits across lower bottom teeth holds it right place when positioned according directions . i afraid it would keep me awake night , but once i figured out correct settings placement , it like wearing contacts ; you don't really notice it if you don't think it . it seem work better me if i lie my back not my side . one thing i didn't understand when i ordered it , this product not made bite down , but separate your teeth so it re-trains your muscles hold your jaw correct positon while you're sleeping so you don't feel need clench all . surprisingly , i only wear it once or twice month . i clenching my teeth ever since i my braces removed teenager . over years my subconcious clenching caused stress cracks my molars migraine headaches . wish i gotten this 25 years ago	1

i don't know those who say " only four uses " ... i use one blade two weeks ( 14 uses ) ... anyway , i like smoothness cut this blade . it really nice . my only complaint blade so fat ( wide ) it hard get those tricky places , like your moustache under your nose . great product , i agree , once you " gillette man " you always gillette man . :)	1
once you're stuck gillette , you're stuck life !!!! ok so yah this new blade system they got going nice . it nice shave . first use or 2 , it doesn't feel like shaving cause it smooth . but really that it . you only get maybe 4 shaves out each blade before you switch . unless you like looking like bloody mess . expensive - gillette death grip all american men . cause stuff works good but they charge you mint just get goods . i like it , i'm user , but arg there no way these worth so much money .	1

i started using this product three months ago wow what difference ! i suffered teenage acne which never really went away when i hit my thirties it came back vengeance . i'm 36 now developed very sensitive skin . never makeup person since it makes me break out . i even tried prescription acne medication , which never worked . finally took six month treatment pills it cleared my skin up but it never same . i don't sun worship not since case sun poisoning when i 24 . i also fair complexion which reddens within five minutes outside . i wear hat while gardening due sensitive nature my skin . freckles everywhere , even my arms . i've plagued dry , sensitive skin trust me over moisturizing doesn't work ! i began use aveeno biore products got my skin under control but i still breakouts . i've tried neutrogena past but wasn't satisfied cleansers stuff .. after reading other reviews this product neutrogena advanced solutions i decided try both them what result ! facial peel i use once week or so , because cost i stretching it using advanced solutions . first thing i noticed dry skin i trouble , which led combination skin dry patches my face improved within couple weeks . i developed this odd condition breaking out my jaw line scars even acne just wouldn't go away .. they're finally gone ! also breakouts i nearly stopped ! i still get breakouts , especially right before my period but soon it happens i use biore facial strips clean out my pores dab some aveeno facial mask , which also marvelous , i control breakouts . some might think i use too many products but reality i rotate them . like when i get zit i dab some aveeno facial mask ( not my entire face , just breakout area ) right before shower rinse it off end . gentle mask soy cleansing doesn't clog my pores . i can't afford facials facial peels so these good alternative . neutrogena facial peel must followed up good moisturizing lotion . i personally use aveeno clear complexion face lotion , this light doesn't clog my pores like some others . also its good idea scrub away flaking skin ( usually next day ) i use aveeno facial two side scrubs ( round jar ) . face soap doesn't dry my skin out scrubbing side perfect sloughing off dried skin . also try neutrogena advanced solutions - this more textured then facial scrub . white sandy thicker solution you dab onto your face use hand held " scrubber " comes kit . its not really scrubber it doesn't rotate , it vibrates . anyway i use this every other day or so , again sparingly . i don't glop stuff my face just few dots , forehead , cheeks , chin jaw anyplace where i might blackheads then follow up face cream . also this doesn't `foam ' up like it looks commercial , it more exfoliating scrub then cleanser . facial peel thinner sort tan gray color , looks sort gross when applying i apply it sparingly thin layer . you really don't need put it heavily . your face tingle , which normal , massage off fingertips or sometimes i use my handheld face sponge . one those free gifts order something or other . you also use sponge advanced solutions circular motions . your face pink up within thirty minutes after using this so don't panic . this normal because it increases circulation your skin which brings blood your cheeks . remember use facial cream while your face still moist . sometimes i forget then my face feels all dry . i usually use these scrubs after i've taken shower my face moist pores open . also use hairband or hair towel keep hair back , its really annoying trying wash face scrub out your hair . follow up toner lotion you should notice difference within couple weeks . other reviews this product point out you continue use these products its true ! but suffered acne all my life frustrated lack good over counter products price worth purchasing these using them . there ways stretching products out like i said above . also great products .. no i don't work aveeno , they just really great products don't cost fortune ! aveenoclear complexion cleansing mask clear complexion daily cleansing pads ( this one scrubbing side smooth side)clear complexion daily moisturizer clear complexion foaming cleanser - absolutely great daily use or even more then once daily . hot weather i use it more often when i feel like cool rinse . correcting treatment , clear complexion if you're looking good moisturizer your body , try aveeno creamy moisturizing oil or moisturizing shower bath oil . i also use jergen ultra healing which you use your face also . bioreblemish ice cleanserdaily deep cleaning pore cleansing cloths - these sometimes better then using toner cotton ball since it full cloth . my husbands actually likes use these also . he also likes pore unclogging scrub when he takes shower triple action astringent . good luck your skin !	1
we used cloth diaper service daughter until she eighteen months . because heavy cloth diaper still wasn't thick enough her so we switched tushies . tushies our first choice disposable diaper because it contains cotton doesn't contain fragrance . i would not use any other conventional diapers because toxic chemicals such dioxin chlorine , fragrance gel . since we adults wear cotton underwears , why shouldn't our child wearing same thing ? one thing i would like see tushies offers more sizes . example , huggies carries six different diaper sizes . also , tushies diapers much more expensive than conventional diapers	1
contour backmax just what we needed post-surgery cushion support . it just pictured described	1

i used panasonic er411nc model great satisfaction past 4 years . er411nc models lasted year each moderate usage . i've very happy their ability deal medium-length hair . sure , there bit burning smell , but who cares when gadget what it supposed -- i.e. , cut hair . this time , i thought i'd try sleeker looking er416kc . big mistake ! blade so far inside it hardly cuts any hair longer than half inch . don't waste your money it , go tried tested er411nc model instead	-1

we used tushies first , then 7th generation ( they smell funky , when we put them baby , first i thought they smell like food , my husband tells me oh , they smell like she number 2 , but i tell him , that how they smell even if baby doesn't anything them , but when i guest they want hold baby i'm embarassed if they think she something diaper , when she doesn't . besides , they fine . we used nature boy girl , i love them , but boy , i think blue thing gel showing diaper . so we went back tushies , no gel , all cotton , natural you get i guess . only reason i give it 4 stars , they damn leak near leg openings , my baby just 3 weeks old , she doesn't pee much . i change both our clothes especially after messy diaper . i'll buy inserts , see if it improves .	1
i am so happy i decided get better hair dryer than pedestrian big box store offerings . air flow concentrated , so it takes significantly less time dry your hair . cord extra long nice . highly recommended	1
dryer meets all your styling needs . it not often you find one suited both curly straight styles . air diffusing attachment perfect creating soft , frizz free curls while concentrator nozzle ( more narrow therefore better conductor air than most models this feature ) allows you direct air exactly where you want it . dryer itself features two speed ( low high ) three heat settings ( cool , warm hot ) , well cold shot button lock style . highest heat setting , simply put dryer high speed hottest setting ( careful , though ... this only recommended hair that uber curly , like mine ) . additionally , 9 foot long cord ( complete loop allow you hook it onto something your bathroom or wherever else you store it ) makes it really easy use . bonus : even highest setting , dryer considerably more quiet than other ones market similarly priced ( you easily hold conversation while speaking normal tone voice ) . according information that included product , dryer made combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology allows special emission ions ( these important eliminating static electricity ) . i found after use , my hair actually lot smoother even than when i used previous hair dryers ionic technology ; i used it style my hair both its naturally curly state after setting it rollers blow dry it straight . if your hair really curly like mine , however , you might still want use flatiron get pin-straight look . but less curly hair or hair that less prone frizz , probably won't necessary . although this far my favorite hair dryer i've ever owned , i agree previous comment this product : it really would perfect dryer if it folding handle . but this only tiny flaw , it more than makes up missing feature its humidity resisting technology . well , remington . invaluable product any styling arsenal	1
i just love this product it must if you bay or just any familky member . great grea	1
i love these 9-volt batteries because 7 year shelf life ! once you buy these you won't need any long time . no more running out store snow when your tv remote batteries die . jl price you can't go wrong ! these suckers heavy duty name you trust , not some generic brand dies after few hours . i've shopped around , there no better industrial strength 9-volt price . way make shopping easy again	1

this first time i ever used bikini trimmer . but i must say this good one i purchased . it came case , oil trimmer , brush clean , 5 settings hair length , this shaver rechargeable , which very nice . it trimmer not shaver so if your looking real close shave you better stick either shaving or just waxing . easy take apart clean . it not too loud , sounds like every other shaver . i'm very pleased my purchase would recommend it any girl ( or guy-i guess ) looking way some maintence area	1
this very well-designed well-made reading light . leds very bright provide nice white light , suitable reading or serve hands-free flashlight . lights rotated thru small axis up or down ( maybe 45 degrees ) so you aim it perfectly . since lights led batteries should last much longer than other bulbs . only problem i this light i originally only bought one my wife liked it so much i surrender it often . now i found it amazon , we'll enough kids , too	1

i just received my air purifier yesterday chance use it near my bed one night sleeping so far . i mild asthma i am heavily effected ozone ( it makes me react badly it ) so part reason i bought this brand it touted " no ozone " it ionizer it those produce ozone . however , you it turned off all times if you want . even it my reactions it mild , i spoke rep rabbit air who 24/7 phone support they told me it uses low power ionizer so its not smelly intense ozone generation . so those asthma ozone sensativity you turn off ionizer ! also those who wondering size it stands 20 inches off floor . pros : -the charcoal/pre filters washable sink or dishwasher-the hepa filter coated antiviral/antibacterial agent last longer- 1.5 year filter life continuous use . -5 year warranty-very clear high tech looking front display -body painted anti electro-static coating prevent dust build up-hepa filter gasket bottom edge perimeter prevent air leakage-the odor particle sensors front actually function accurately . i would thought it cheap gimmick but they actually work ! its nice extra feature you don't see elsewhere . ( when you buy one spray some air freshener or puff powder somewhere middle room watch odor/particle lights crank up shortly afterward)cons : ( small gripes , but not enough me effect 5 star rating , but if this 1 out 10 scoring system . i'd give it 9 or 9.5 )-i dont problem this but some people say front panel bright bedroom . if you like perfect blank room then find way cover display . no way shut off front display other then power off . -the unit requires remote control get all its higher functions . all you unit itself turn power on/off . remote uses over sized watch battery so it wont something you laying around house spare backup . -the ionizer turns itself every time you select new function remote ( speeds settings ) so , you need turn it back off everytime you change its settings ( not big deal)-some people surprised its size . but after getting it its mid thigh high . you press it up against wall if you want .. since its somewhat thin profile it takes up less floor space then thise giant square or round designs other air purifiers . i am not sure if its worth price yet . however , so far so good ! when you look price competition quality featurs you get this . its very nice comparable model put your shopping radar if you market	1
i just got this air purifier today , so i can't comment affectiveness , but i say so far i'm impressed it . it easy set up , many different settings , automatically monitor air quality so you set it forget it . it senses both particles air odors air separately which i though cool feature . it extremely quiet low i also love fact filters cleanable so they last longer . i say manual very confusing how often replace filters though , so i went rabbitair website able instant message representative . literally within seconds i my answer . hepa filter technically last up 3 years depending your use , but indicator light go after 18 months regardless . aside , if you don't replace filter every 18 months warranty void . carbon filter replaced every 3 6 years , again based how much use it gets . metal pre-filter never replaced . unit very light , although it lot bigger than i expected it . overall , this product seems like it going great my dust dander allergies	1
my dermatologist recommended this my sensitive , somewhat oily skin . it cleans without harsh	1
cetaphil make great line products . almost everyone use them , because there no fragrance , colour or anything else irritate your skin . this cleanser no exception . it actually got no real fragrance , but you smell natural smell all neutral ingrediants it . it feels nice going skin , but if you heavy make-up , it not best remover . you should probably use this either only morning before applying make-up , or if you use non-heavy make-up . i use this often - i love how my skin doesn't feel tight or dry after using it i lent it friend one time who very sensitive skin , she no problems . give it try . it makes cheap alternative expensive cleansers either same job or less superior job . this great	1

previous reviews overall pretty negative , so i am here offer different pov . i this product few months now , used four or five times , i haven't experienced any problems it . i always problems cheap electric clippers past , but price one barbershop haircut , you get least one service out it , so i bought it anyways . so far , i happy it person get . if it break down future , though , i won't really feel too bad it . note it bit bulky	1
free chlorine other junk , they work well don't smell like so many others . thumbs up	1

microflex r-845 provides me smooth rapid shave every day without any discomfort . i would recommend it over any blade shaving	1
i've using this 4 years , very satisfied . way better than my previous single-blade shaver . it sometimes annoying it runs only battery , not directly wallplug , but it doesn't happen often .. razor head easily detached cleaned , which i think true any norelco or remington products . but please bear mind this review based my personal experience : asian early 30s . average density asian , which i believe fairly light compared average american . rather thick strong hair , but doesn't grow fast . 2 ~ 3 shaves per week enough me ..	1
this lotion excellent under liquid make-up . it not only moisturizes skin but it sun block well .	1
my dermatologists recommended eucerin extra protective moisture lotion 3 years ago . it so highly recommended because it not clog pores protects skin very harmful uv rays . i recommend eucerin extra protective moisture lotion everyone	1

this excellent product , one which far superior other walkers baskets market . its non-institutional appearance real asset . padded basket cover foam-encircled back rail provide comfortable seat home or outside . it turns ease , while still offering real stability . it store easily backseat or trunk . weight may make it slightly unwieldy lift above waist high , there some assembly required .	1
this product could not remove all minor scratches my lens . top , brush left dust my lens which dried solution	1
i something similar this when i kid i used it consistently . construction quality this one seems higher than one i remember using 20 years ago . i would recommend this sedentary person who needs some activity , but not someone hoping get cardiovascular workout or bulk up . i my fingers toes amputated , so there aren't really lot options me . included instructions don't really give you wide range exercises this , so it effective you may invent some new ones some trial error . when it wears out ( it appears it may awhile ) , i buy one	1
don't believe all whiners here who left negative feedback . i owned exerciser like this some years ago nylon rope plastic pulleys . it great , quick workout home i lost thing move . i glad get similar item elastic bands only $10 . far using it , just bind doorhandle loop rubber band or tape . move away door , just add length nylon 3/8 inch rope . what heck you expect $10 !	1
this exerciser would useless you unless you extremely out shape . learn leg raises yourself , throw few pushups . someone hold your feet while you learn situps . don't waste your money	1
it actually scared me intially - because burning smell heat . but now after using it over year , i'd recommend this product but not keep high expectations . design good enough reach places :-)	1

course it individual thing , but my wife found bristles this brush too stiff harsh use her back . i bought brush her her request . i never use these things myself , so i cannot comment personally . palm my hand bristles seem soft enough . she needed replacement similar brush no longer made . just heads up others might find brush too stiff use . i gave brush 4 stars because otherwise it seems like good product . but harshness , course , deal breaker . she going buy brush store so she check bristles first hand -- probably good idea anyone	1
i hate traditional sunscreen tends oily heavy . i liked idea sheer light feel neutrogena . so i tried both neutrogena ultra sheer spf 30 45 . soon i applied product , i felt strong burning sensation throughout my entire face . not some tingly sensation associated some products . it felt like my face fire . i immediately washed it off . it still hurt . i cool it cold water numb pain . next day , my face pink throughout my skin still hurt . i tried variety products , cetaphil , purpose , alba , lancome , estee lauder , clarines , chanel , clinique , many over counter products typically found any drug store . i never such reaction . note , i don't sensative skin . my skin tends normal little shine zone . my mom , who dry skin , tried products . she also complained it hurt use either spf 30 or 45 . i throw them away . don't waste your money .	-1

hi , i usually dont like wasting time write reviews but since i so impressed this massager i write one . i just bought it today brookstone after seeing this website well let me tell you little it . their two speeds massager high low , massager spring like head it very soft , it very quiet discreet looking , it cordless so you dont bother cords getting your way when using it , all this makes it massager one best massagers i owed . $50 you cant go wrong i would paid up $100 this no joke	1
i bought this replace tempur-pedic pillow gotten " musty " after several years use . homedics foam material very slightly different . it not quite soft but it stays cooler itself , also thanks ventilation holes through pillow . this makes me actually prefer this over what i before , even without considering tremendous price difference . early indications this pillow last long time , there absolutely no sign any deterioration , even my significant movement during night	1

overall , this isn't bad sunscreen . it contains avobenzone , which recommended dermatologists its broad-spectrum protection . scent light not too objectionable . it little thicker than some sunscreens , which makes it more difficult spread , but it also ensures more complete coverage . one minor drawback it greasy sticky , most sunscreens . but worst problem migration into eyes ( coppertone products seem among worst this ) . since it advertised waterproof " non-stinging " specifically targeted use young children , you'd think it would safe use close eyes , but such not case . my young daughter small amount water splash her face , she instantly felt sunscreen stinging her eye . this hour after application , amount water hit her eye only few drops . debilitating discomfort persisted entire day couldn't relieved rinsing her eye saline . ( water babies isn't waterproof eyelids , but apparently it sticks pretty well eye itself ! )so bottom line this sunscreen acceptable use body , but avoid using it anywhere near eyes	1
daughter richard trezevant- after thanksgiving last year i began breaking out horrible acne some reason i dont know ; maybe it greesy food i eating or cetaphil i using wasnt strong enough my face . i finally decided enough enough i found this neutrogena . i used it before but i completely forgot how it exsisted . ive using it ever since it really helped ; now my face mostly just light scarring . my only concern though doesnt help me when im my period . i start breakout out really badly especially around my chin my lips .	1

my dr . recommended i might want try this , since i cannot tolerate other fibers . it best . you mix it any juice , food product , ex . applesauce , cranberry juice , etc .. mainly i mix it cranberry juice breakfast , supper . when i go back my dr . he asks how it . no horrible taste like some others ; matter fact , there no taste all . i put it glass first , then add benefiber stir . 1/2 minute its ready . definitly good product if you need fiber . one visit , i heard dr. suggest it patient . however , before using any product like this , it would good ask your dr . love it !!!! i use only powder-do not like tablets	1
users seem love or hate this product . i've using it faithfully many years . it greenish pasty this puts some people off . use large pea-size amount enough water foam your face ( eyelids o.k. too-it gentle ) , then let dry 15-20 min . rinse well cleanse remove any residue , your skin feel soft smooth . it spendy , but jar last long time . if aha exfoliators too harsh you , this may work . amazon price very good	1
when you very young ( i think back those days ) , your skin cells epidermis constantly state rejuvenation . skin renews itself approximately every 28 days . we all age , this process start take twice long . so , skin cells start build up top layer skin . this causes dehydrated , rough dull complexion . slower cell production , free radical damage breakdown collagen elastin encourages those little wrinkles start appear . you start use vitamin skin cream hope best , but really you still fighting all those dead skin cells which clog pores promote sebum build up ( cause breakouts blemishes ) . best skin care regimen also includes exfoliation , topically applied antioxidants sunscreen ! try vitamin cream avalon active organics coq10 facial cleansing cr�me . all zia products most impressive . i'm quite love all products i've tried so far . fresh papaya enzyme peel no exception . this smooth earthy almost scent-free green mask contains papain activated water . papain protein-digesting enzyme dissolves dead skin cells without disturbing live , healthy ones . it found unripened papaya fruit . it all natural , non-abrasive exfoliant . it removes dead surface skin your face give you more even texture . most traditional scrubs too harsh use granules strip top layer skin , healthy cells all . this result irritation over-production oil even scarring . you cleanse your skin then apply small amount your damp face . enzyme supposed stay active up 1 hour . first time you use this , you leave it 5-20 minutes . then you increase time 40 minutes , etc . before rinsing , you reapply some water massage gently , then rinse off warm water . it recommended use last three times week , but gentle enough use every day . you notice difference more vibrant look your skin after using this product few times . i've noticed dry weather mask tends dry bit my face , so keep spray bottle pure water handy keep mask moist . this not mask you want let dry . when you go spa , they always steamer your face during enzyme treatment phase , so you might also want use this product same way . just don't let this get your eyes ! putting saturated cotton pad over each eye might help . it contains : green papaya concentrate , sunflower oil , unfiltered hawaiian honey , citrus oil extract , vitamin acetate , ceteareth 20 , methylparaben , propylparaben , diazolidinyl urea . helps repair sun damage , remove age spots other discolorations . also try zia acne treatment mask which used spot treatment or help control breakouts . it contains colloidal sulphur , silica , camphor tea tree essential oil . look pumpkin exfloiating mask citrus night time reversal . zia products cruelty free ! this product must all skin types ! ~ therebeccareview.com	1

i really like twinlab amino fuel quick convenient protein boost , prefer it over any competing products i've seen , two reasons : taste , which reminds me orange-juice concentrate honey , very easy palate . competing products tend overpowering , sickly sweet or gamy flavors which hard swallow after awhile . amount amino acids per serving much higher than most , greater net gain less consumed	1

after many years multiblade , titanium , battery powered , " real man " shaving systems who blades last 2 shaves i decided try something new . i must admit i've never experienced closer , more satisfying shave outside old fashioned barbershop . this well made razor last many years . it simplistic design , solid construction , quality finish sure make this my lifetime razor . thank you merkur	1
this razor small but important learning curve . if you're used using something like mach 3 ( my first wet shave razor)or any multi-blades this take some getting used . small easy strokes absolutely no pressure except weight this razor way go . one stroke one side , stroke other then rense . one pass grain most way go but if you desire closer shave then i suggest re-lather , ( which important wetshaving ) lightly shave across , not against grain . those wanting good shave , you spend little more time than using multiblade razors . i suggest badger hair brush some traditional shave cream or soap like geo . trumpers or trufitt or taylor old bond street . plan no less than five minutes good close shave start lathering toweling off . i also suggest skin food trumpers or some preshave oil art shaving help razor glide . i enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade i think any user who take time learn use it . if you're constantly hurry shave your way , i don't suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor matter .	1
this scale easy set up use . it reports lot information help weight loss training clear fashion . ability keep track 4 people also very useful household . i can't judge accuracy its body fat readings , but they appear very consistent day day	1

this great when you pets hard floor surfaces since it seems you fighting endless battle fur ! however , it only gets 4 stars because there some cons - they fix these annoying quirks it 5 stars ! cons : * battery loses power very quickly - so fast ! ( approx . 10-20 minutes depending how long it charged prior )* it takes entire day fully charge * if you fully charge it unplug it out using it , it loses power * filter isn't replaceable ( swiffer , apparently there some dirtdevil filter fits)pros : * picks up hair crumbs all dust/dirt cloth * light weight * no cord drag around * even sucks up walls corners ( when fully charged )	1
i love this item ! i tell anyone i how great it i not miss my broom dust pan one single bit ! i would buy one heart beat my husband makes fun me how much i praise it i am using it . i would 100% reccommend it anyone who feels like they constantly sweeping their floor all messes our kids make . buy this today you won't regret it	1

my wife ( mid-50 ) hip replacement therapy last week , so i scoured all amazon reviews find what she would need recover home rather than rehab center . she operated tuesday returned home friday able walk few steps climb stairs . kit came handy right start . - reach extender - works really well it her favorite item kit . she able pick up coins floor it . there small magnet tip , but magnet isn't very strong . won't pick up glass or soda because jaws aren't wide enough , but hasn't issue her . there other types extenders you buy , if you need this capability . - dressing aid - she keeps this upstairs use bed bath uses it like reach extender pick up clothes towels . also used put slippers more easily than shoe horn . - sock aid - ingenious device really works . it bit stiff which requires some effort get sock it , but probably loosen use . even works nylon hosiery . - shoe horn long handled sponge - nothing fancy , but they job . i spent first 5 days home helping her out , but after , this kit elevated toilet seat only items she needed take care herself allowed me return back work . bonus tip : her surgeon suggested using plastic food wrap wrap around her leg , hip torso keep her dressing dry while showering . i replaced regular showerhead handheld sprayer flexible hose . this combination allowed her shower without getting her dressing wet during first week home hospital	1

works advertised . won't make blade shavers happy but i've using dry electric shavers years this works me . nose/ear trimmer pleasantly quiet which concern if you're sticking it your ear	1
i'm pretty young shaver i've only 1 other electric razor compare this , so i can't really speak lot experience . my old shaver bottom-of-the-line norelco simply tore my face shreds . there none this 30 days adjust thing , it just always uncomfortable shave . now i'm shaving more frequently however i thought i'd get decent one this panasonic great . i fairly sensitive face but i think my beard only needed 4 or 5 days fully adjust . even if razor dry , it shaves very close doesn't irritate my skin . unless i'm running late i usually use some edge gel , which works like dream this razor . i kind would preferred maybe stand or small cut price instead nosehair trimmer , but that just minor gripe . if you get this razor though , make sure you clean it after every time you use it . all you squirt some liquid/gel soap it turn it then rinse it off . there very little effort involved because replacement razor heads aren't cheap , it would your best interests just get habit cleaning it	1
i bought this my husband christmas . he liked using it so far no complaints it . it seems well made nice job removing his facial hair . ear trimmer just nice bonus .	1

i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	1

i boughten this gift which turned out aweful idea . it way too loud force air way too strong . it literally causes loss hearing causes your hair look like you just caught tornado . i not recommend this hair dryer anyone .	-1
i really like size this pitcher but there one thing i'm not too happy . filter doesn't " lock " down into top when you tip pitcher over pour water out , filter plops out top , causing whole top fall out pitcher . it very aggravating just makes it more trouble than it worth . other brita pitcher i , filter locks into place doesn't this .	1
it doesn't what it supposed . this gizmo supposed clean out pores generally clean up skin your face . didn't work me	-1

these ' cartridges ' sell $2 piece , plus shipping . i recently switched mach 3 turbo merkur double edge safety razor i safely say i never go back . mach 3 provides decent enough shave ( much better than electric , my experience ) but single blade actually much smoother . i pay 50 cents blade now safety razor - each blade lasts little over week - versus mach 3 $1.50 - $2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days	1
i don't particularly large skull but these barely fit together bridge my nose . i don't see how manufacturer claim one size fits all ; i said i don't huge melon like mike myers brother " so i married axe murderer " . idea/concept great but ... i'll probably return them . unfortunate because i really looking forward using them . people really big heads , caveat emptor	-1

our first unit lasted almost 2 months . despite relatively short lifespan , i thought product worth it considering dirt-cheap price . however , second unit we got leaked water base during its first use ; so , it went back amazon very same day it arrived our home . this product so dangerous . without exercising some safety precaution , it cause electrocution !	-1
i saw commercial , i read reviews - so i bough one box walmart . it not worth it , that my conclusion . trays made very thin plastic-like material , very difficult position properly your teeth . active gel easy goes out trays , fills your mouth . during first couple od uses , after 20 min or so i started feel vague pain my gum . nevertheless , i continued using product all 7 days , advertised , 30 min day . after whole package gone , change color my teeth barely visible . i hope you better luck .	-1
i really like my electric toothbrush oralb so i thought i would like this too . however , it just doesn't work . cartridges they set up don't work because soon you tug them all , floss becomes loose therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it taut . but because way they cartridges set up , there no way make it taut again . it would worked if instead they used roll floss let you feed it through yourself needed , but they too greedy wanted sell lots cartridges . this would ok if you got lots use out cartridges , but my experience they broke halfway through single use . so ... forget it	1

while one would think it would impossible foul up such simple common tool , manufacture indeed so . " spoon " portion this shoe horn attached heavy coil . i supposed this intended give working end some flexibility , but instead using fastener or weld , its just rolled metal inserted into coil . after only two uses " spoon " came out coil even though i could easily enough put it back together , after couple more uses it became so loose it would not stay . basically its now shoe horn minus twenty something inch handle now . would recommend buying more simply designed , single piece shoe horn .	-1

there so many different sites all tell you ' they ' best absorbed coenzyme q10 manufactured . it hard know who really telling absolute truth or just propagandizing product quick sale . we born extremely high levels coenzyme q10 then it gets slowly used up years pass even if we actually eat foods resupply our bodies . who purposefully eats these foods coenzyme q10 content ? mitochondria every single cell our body needs this coenzyme production energy . time we over 40 , our levels dropped significantly our energy levels dropped it . i must admit this nature made product not seem increase my energy level like other company coenzyme q10 . so , my own reaction this product , i not recommend this particular coenzyme q10 . there several other companies make excellent , effective products ( like dr. whitaker dr. sinatra dr. william ) but not this nature made product	-1

my wife high bp , so we got this model . reasons choosing this model : 1 . upper arm monitors supposed more accurate2 . it cheaper than fully automatic models3 . omron seems one better/best brands . 4 . supposedly , pumps fully automatic models prone breaking . unit appears well built ( including hand pump ) . it easy operate , it seems very accurate . we checked its readings fully manual unit we home , automatic unit drug store . we find it takes very accurate consistent readings . people physical limitations might find hand pump inconvenient . also , people big arm might need buy larger cuff . i'm overweight right now , so cuff barely fits my arm , but fits my wife nicely ( it bought her )	1
my grandfather found vial old spice his navy kit when he joined 1943 . he continued using it after war my father picked it up when he himself came age . i began shaving ten years ago choice obvious : old spice conservative masculine , distinct time-honored . it not trend ; it statement manhood . if proctor amp ; gamble obliges , my own grandkids using it	1

this great iron starter , but not it like stylist . i it least 2 years so it last also . price little bit high i only paid $ 19.99 it walmart . i know everyone gotten used shopping online because it eay always open , but i tell you most things i found amazon priced way high . they used great spot get good stuff cheap but no longer true . i think it just kind creeped up us without us noticing what going . please folks go back out world start looking you see i am not wrong	1

my wife i both love this . our opinion thicker plastic tines offer more comfortable pleasurable " head trip " than trippers one might find mall . vibrations make it better than non-vibrating head trippers but not overwhelming . benefit this particular device it able completely disassembled packed taken you travelsor vacations . it pretty simple device , sold reasonable cost , my opinion better implementation than metal ones	1
it great job , i just tought it woundn't let any hair go , but i gess that impossible	1
it nice if you looking simple hair dryer . it its job pretty nicely . dual voltage option plus you use it anywhere world . little big travelling , but compromises its folding handle light weight . disadvantage you cant use it high 240 voltage . it hard because you might tend put it high then would kill equipment	1

what i wanted christmas something turn my bath tub into whirlpool , my boyfriend bought this me . bubbles no doubt amazing , they're plenty strong even lowest setting . massage part , i didn't use too much- it just vibrates some , bubbles seemed more massaging than vibrating massager . only thing i not really care it kind difficult keep tub floor . it suction cups , but they didn't work too well- everytime i moved my feet or legs , it wanted float top water . overall , i'd say this pretty good gift ! i definitely use it many more times	1
i love these little bibs . i say little , because even though they size regular cloth bibs , big size bibsters , which i also bought , huge , cover my 9mo . old baby almost past his diapers . i reluctant buy bibsters first , because they seemed such waste material disposable- i guess they -- however , they serve good purpose they extremely light thin fully waterproof , so my super-drooler doesn't get his outfits totally wet like he his cloth bibs , which i'm frequently switching out . bibsters also very easy pack into diaper bag , i'm never without bib . i've also using big size bibsters my 2yr old car , random snack spills . these not really reusable , but i sometimes use them 2 meals , depending how clean they . price right when amazon grocery spend 50 get 10 dea	1

i love smell essential oil air . i've tried tealight burners , smear low-burning lamp , miniature crockpot designed aromatherapy . pearlessence spa mist absolutely best ever diffusing odor continuing diffuse it extended period time . because i live humid climate , i concerned misting would only add mold problems perhaps mar wooden furniture . cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air . light show base turned off , but i like it most time . product offered $10 less than well-known local natural market chain , shipping free my order over $25 other products .	1
really strong when just sprayed , but after little while it gets soft , but same time not too soft . perfume lasts few hours , time i go bed , scent would still there faintly , i fall asleep it . it fresh strong first , then soft sweet . love it	1
if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

after 3 months use , i'm buying two more these my daughters . unit compact , very sturdy , virtually silent , puts out plenty mist even low setting . small tank light easy fill , even bathroom sink ( many people really wrestle those one gallon tanks ) yet it easilly lasts through 8 hour work day or nights sleep . key feature it small quiet . means it near you desk top or night table . mist nearer you less ambient air means less condense cold windows ( cause mildew ) . it also means you use low setting which makes small tank last longer reduces any risk vapor droplets settling table top . if you want use high setting , put unit top book shelf , dresser or file cabnit allow longer path mist settle . this small light enough take road dry hotel rooms . one daughter wants one her dorm room , which overheated . unit easily moved bedroom den or wherever you locate during day . you would not find this convenient large ( gallon ) humidifiers . this unit also inexpensive , around $30 which half cost many larger models ( so you get two ) . after using several evaporative humidifiers , i love not spending $6 - $9 month paper replacement wicks . overall , i am delighted unit . only criticsm blue led too bright dark room . this easily dimmed putting piece masking or adhesive tape over it . light helpful avoid bumping unit if you reach phone or tissue dark night . it also lights up mist so you know there still water chamber . highly recommended .	1
this product works great water retention . i like it doesn't keep you running ladies room , works great	1
this well-made device useful , though limited , value . it usefulness derives its consistency , which amazing . given your body composition varies throughout day , particularly your level hydration , omron measurements vary only fractions percent - exactly what you would expect . it measures small electric currents running one electrode , through your body , second electrode . omron programmed estimate your body fat measuring impedance your body flow electricity . so , one might think such measurement would straightforward , like weight scale . electricity encounters fat , muscle , bone , fluids omron interprets current displays your body fat percent . right ? after all , when you step scale , scale responds showing your weight . you don't need tell scale whether you think you athlete or how old you . it simply measures your weight . well , omron doesn't work way , nor other similar devices , nor skin-fold calipers . it looks me though electrical skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat . then they require you input other data , such your activity level ( " normal " or " athlete " omron case ) age . this not good because it introduces general population averages into what should specific measurements you . instance , regardless your body , it assumed older you , more internal fat you . resulting body fat estimates dramatically different when factoring those variables . omron ( calipers ) still useful , though , if you consider it compass rather than scale . you can't sure it tell you where you , but , over time , it tell you where you going .	1

i tried several " energy bars " found hooah best doing what it says it , give me steady energy . most other energy bars i tried , pick me up then knock me down few hours later . i feel confident feeding them my family too . my 8 year old son races motocross eats one before each moto . my daughter eats one before cheering football games before her 4 hours dance lessons . my husband , contractor/builder , eats one before hectic work day . i keep up all them sometimes don't time breakfast or lunch , i just grab hooah bar i am set . they like bread milk our house , if we out , everyone mad mom . since we several friends family members armed forces , we also like fact portion each sale goes military . thanks hooah !	1

i never eaten luna bar before i made this purchase , so i expectations not even close fufilled . when i read " chocolate pecan pie " .. i expected just .. taste rich chocolate , nutty pecans gooey sugary base . what i received bar little taste , nothing all similar name bar . my opinion , bar edible if you no expectations it ... flavor barely there . bar dry . it never again my " purchase " list	-1
this high powered toothbrush helps you brush better . however , it not magic . you still know " how brush . " it also much more messy , using this kind toothbrush , but dental hygenists strongly recommend them	1
first shave seemed good ; but second time me fusion . instead just one nick , i managed around 3 or 4 nicks once . but looking cost replacement cartridges enough shock look cheaper alternative shaving . i purchased merkur futur german made adjustable safety razor it only costs 40 cents or less each merkur razor blade they alot sharper ! merkur heavy duty safety razor supposed great beginners safety razor also highly rated ! one even get 100 blade bulk packs derby extra double edge blades merkur ebay which average just around 16 cents or less apiece . sensor more practical me ! my opinion , gillette must think we all willing pay high prices these fusion blades new modern 4 bladed shave . lately , there seems trend more men going back good old fashioned shave using double edge safety razor ! i wonder why ?	-1
i offered one these while cycling thought it very tasty . so good , fact , when i got home i went straight web site show back wrapper learn where i could buy them . just above web address nutrition ingredients list . probably mistake manufacturer part it gives you something read while site comes up . oops ! this bar whooping 25% your daily allowance saturated fat ! not only , but fat palm oil . this might acceptable soldier involved prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt cardiologist would recomend it most us . commercially formulated product more likely fill average person need lower fat ( healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated extreme physical activity , sold profit marketed patriotic tribute troops . bottom line : read label , weigh health risks if you want support troops , there better way than eating hooah bars .	1
i finally found product works me , after trying too many other products . i tried magic shave powder but couldn't use it no more than once month ( damn thing reeked , too ) . if i didn't get all hairs , i'd toast . i would use razor finish job , which defeated purpose not getting ingrown hairs . i tried magic shave creamer , didn't work either . i would get most my beard , but if there anything left over , i'd same position use razor finish . i tried norelco ( received christmas ) but couldn't deal my hairs pulled ( ouch !! ) . i bought beard trimmer wahl cut my beard skin , then used magic shave razor . it worked but still got razor bumps ( not bad ) sometimes bled . i vacationing florida my friends who visited his sister brother-in-law . his brother-in-law happened neighborhood barber , he used this razor my face . i got so enamored , went i got back i went online bought it immediately . since i know my face very well , i realized i only use this shaver most twice week . i used this since february 2006 , it wonderful . i give it four stars because , even though it works like product says , i get little bump here there . all all , i recommend this product men suffers in-grown hairs . please note , after reading other reviews , usage individualized . other words , know what your limits terms how many times you use shaver . you might able use it daily or weekly	1

i've tried lot energy bars this best tasting . i am however partial peanut butter . cliff bars my favorite , but these taste much better bit crisp them . cliff bar dry tasting comparison . i would given this bar 5 stars it not used palm oil . this ups saturated fat , which i need watch . corn surup not best thing ingesting either but since i am working out burning it off its proabably not problem . this bar lowest sat . fat ( 2g , 10%rda ) than their other two bars most potasium . later important me because it may help ward off my leg cramps . i agree vitamins probably marketing ploy - after all , anyone who exersizes regularly probably takes multivitamin . i'd give it 4-1/2 stars if i could .	1

" it large enough wrap around sore shoulder well down back , it nice controls four heat settings , turns off after hour or so ( safety ) . unfortunately , it only 3 weeks before it stopped working . i exchanged it unit ( thought maybe it fluke ) . replacement lasted two months almost daily use , then died . it appears controller simply burns out . i would not recommend this heating pad	-1
we bought this thinking it would great product . we able get steam out it awhile , but we nurse it . times it drained out onto carpet ; other times it produced no steam . even nusing it , humidifier broke down after three months now we can't use it all . hope others better luck it than we .	1
product good shape . got good value money . shipping fast services good . good buy overall	1
okay , let see if i write this review so not offend amazon fastidious editors ... guys , if you want plug-in massager please your wife or girl friend , hitachi magic wand what you need . however -- gals , if you want plug-in massager please your husband or boy friend -- panasonic ev2510k one ! why ? because panasonic more powerful than hitachi , its hard plastic roller head better suited man , um , contours . addition , panasonic quiet causes no video interference , selling point case you augment your " massage " sessions some video stimulation ... only reason i don't give panasonic five stars previous " panabrators " proven less than reliable ; typically they seem last year before they conk out . still , get ev2510k , you'll most enjoyable year	1
we this product 2 months . it alleviated my sinus issues quite bit . it not only keeps air too dry , it keeps room lit nicely . its perfect amount light see if you want get up night , but not so bright it keeps you awake . i also like it refilled daily because i am always misting fresh water into air	1
i little worried this one , based price , but it worth it . yes , epilator painful , so if you don't want pain then don't buy one . you won't get completely smooth skin right away , it'll take more than one session over course few weeks , but hair you remove won't come back thick or densely . i recommend using skin guard if you're doing your underarms , since skin more sensitive there	1

i recently started using phytobase hoodia delite shakes every morning breakfast . i shakes almost month now not gotten tired them , all . i believe hoodia gordonii really work supress appetite . feeling hungry all time obsticle me past . after using these shakes few days , i felt less less hungry each day . now , i no problem getting through day without nagging hunger pangs . taste fantastic . it mixed milk or water . i usually mix it fat-free organic milk i like add frozen berries . frozen berries add little more sweetness make mix thick creamy . best thing mix how many vitamins minerals it . it 50% or more almost everything . i definitely difference since i started these dailies . i more energy less fatigue . my biggest complaint price . it around $30 18 servings . 3x cost similar products , such slim fast . advantage phytobase product it low calorie , sugar free made organic ingredients . i think when you compare benefits phytobase commercial products , like slim fast , phytobase ends up coming out ahead worth cost . still , i would like see price come down $10 . overall , i like this product . if you don't mind spending extra money , i think it worth it	1
product looks very different on-line . not thick viewed . gave gift . they seem like it	1

schick top name razors overall but it also always lead competition its silk effects razor . while silk effects still demand , schick came out quattro women , probably compete gilette venus , this " newer " razor lives up its competition many ways . women using their husbands ' razors ages because they shave more accurately more precision so it only makes sense simply modify man razor fit woman , which exactly what schick this produc t.t his razor even feels like it something more substantial than your basic woman razor because one its main elements : metal . unlike other plastic razors , this razor feels ( looks ) much more substantial , perhaps because it feels tougher heavier ; it not razor i would readily throw away - nor would i want both razor replacement blades cost quite bit even if prices par other leading razors . it feels more like man razor . , one might argue it but even elements regular quattro considered improvement over regular female razors . both quattro quattro women boast 4 precise blades , metal handle which might actually help shaving accuracy , comfort grips . quattro women gives us something little more . obviously , it " feminized " changing colour black pink but this razor also pivoting head make shaving feminine curves easier conditioning strip . enough advertising , though . this good razor . if it not #1 market then it #2 without doubt good reason . i shave many parts my body i always get least good shave , if not better , quattro . i find this razor works best certain parts my body , however , i not giving up my venus anytime soon . while i get good shave my legs underarms , i prefer use this razor my bikini line bikini area . i find areas prone razor bumps rash shave much more nicely not become irritated my quattro but areas shaved fine my venus , not seem shave smoothly quattro . this blade seems dull fairly easily well , though perhaps it because i tend use it more dense hair . you really cannot stretch it out " just one more " shave . when it dulls , razor bumps irritation increase almost exponentially , more than once , numerous blades " tugged " my hair skin . there other elements quattro worth discussing than just quality shave , however . this razor comes handy , compact suction cup holder stick your shower wall or door . although sometimes it seems fall , it usually holds up well quite improvement over bulky holder venus . nevertheless , this holder not any place store your extra razor blades . furthermore , you wouldn't want store your blades your shower case they , those sleek it , not entirely enclosed moisture deteriorate moisture strips blades . therefore , if you're like me remember you need change your blade only once you shower , you'll jump out shower it . however , my complaints really not overshadow this quality product . it still top line , since i purchased it , i extremely pleased quality though i still continue use my venus some parts my body	1

reading magnifiers i ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after call seller . ( original order shipped amazon.com so it reshipped me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so assemble one reading magnifiers , it possible adjust it just any position clever arm . weighted base keep it falling over . unfortunately , thin plastic lense such poor quality it very difficult receive any benefit device . if user turned adjustment knob too far , it nut holds it together would fall off . nut small must inserted into outside adjustment knob assemble device . knob actually turns nut onto screw . presumably device someone low vision . if small nut falls floor , i'm not sure someone low vision would able find it . my advice save your money buy quality device nice glass lens .... if possible , try device out before buying .	1

razor blades expensive enough it , trend " more better " reached almost ludicrous points industry . what ? five blades , you say ? why , it must better than four ! meh . i fine stubble which grows varying angles across my neck . good news , while other razors always unable remove all my stubble first try , this blade , fact , take care problem . addition this , it aggravated skin quite bit ( this might much vibrating action five blades ) . precious soothing-aloe strip little no effect my skin ( particularly neck area ) . if you sensitive skin all , this might not razor you . contrary experience others , however , extra " trimming " blade worked well me when getting spots edge my mouth , under my nose , when shaping my vast hedge-like sideburns . however , five blades other side dulled remarkably fast . considering my rather fine hairs , i'm used exchanging blades once every week or so . now i'm exchanging them twice week . seeing how this product already so much more expensive than competitors ' products , seeing how it designed work exclusively fusion razor ( vice versa ) , seeing how its lavish wealth cutting action clawed my skin , i find it hard recommend	1
i would give this product negative 50 stars if i could . i paid beaucoup several very plain bras ( no lace or other embelishments ) didn't wear or wash bras until i received brababy . i assumed brababy would protect my bras wash , that what product claims . imagine my suprise when i pulled my bras out washer ( out their respective " bra demolition cages " ) find them ruined . i'm talking not wearable . straps both brand new , never worn , previously mint condition bras hanging out all over place looked like they chewed animal . both bras dents molded cups . then i saw one bras two noticeable rips cup ! i nearly flipped out ! i think my bras would've better " washed " i thrown them into center pack rabid fighting mad dogs . only positive thing report amazon refunded my money . back hand washing my bras back mall i go replace ripped bra . perhaps other it dented cups suitable halloween ?	-1
ok folks , this relatively low quality starter kit really decent company . art shaving products general really nice , albeit tad pricey . this small kit gives you nice sample entire line shaving products work nicely together . full sized items cost you $75 - $100 total . included brush " toss away " quality brush . this not just my opinion , but quote manager art shaving store . my advice get some samples department store , then purchase art shaving shave cream ( wow ! great product ) here amazon , plus either tweezerman badger brush $15 or best badger brush crabtree evelyn $35 .	1
two main problems this " cordless massager " . first it doesn't hold charge very long . you may get hour use full charge , shows diminishing power it goes . add it general lack any real massaging capability you one very poor piece equipment . if you're looking something rumble slight bit , this you . otherwise , save your money	-1

upon purchasing this product , i'd hoped it would equivilant product i normally purchase salon . i horribly disappointed . it nothing all like typical product , rather much more like water . normal scent not present , product made my hair greasy my head itched all day long . i would very much like return this . it not all same product purchased salon . i sorely disappointed	-1
i quite liked this trimmer while it worked well , so i'm disappointed how it held up through only little over six months . now battery hold barely any charge , if all . it frustrating it crap out me after initially pleased its functions	1

we recently bought same model dispenser , but satin finish . first , only two three chambers usable because pumps didn't work ( yes , we followed instructions carefully ) . two months later , pump given out so only one chamber usable . instead this loser , try " dispenser 71450 classic iv .

i like how quickly rollers heat - vast improvement over waiting least half hour . however , like other reviewer said - i absolutely hate clips . they all one size , so they too large smallest rollers . i also don't like them because they don't keep roller still like " u " shaped clips , they leave dent impression my hair . i don't recommend them primarily because clip system	1
my rollers constantly popping out clip holders this set , regardless me using more or less hair . maybe there magical perfect portion hair roller ratio . if so it impossible find . i dunno , but i know i would not recommend these . also even when i get these stay my hair , my hair doesn't curl nearly much it usually hot rollers . overall buy something else	-1

when i ordered this item , i assumed flosser attachment would some sort gadget which you would add new dental floss each use . actually , each flosser plastic prong pre-strung floss it , used once discarded . let me see : million conscientious users floss daily you 365,000,000 plastic doodads added world landfills every year . i already compromise my principles convenience more than i'd like admit . this totally over top . when i've used up my supply flossers , out this thing goes . it goes into landfill , sure . so don't anyone else make my mistake	-1
these not suppress my appetite , though many days i took 3 tablets three times day ! very good luck bottle dytrexil ( also hoodia product ) , but next bottle , nothing . i guess like crops , you get good batches bad batches . these struck me bad batch . one reviewer said , i actually felt hungrier many days . egad ! better luck next time ! sigh	-1

i purchased this product thinking it better than hand held models or scale type models , since it combines measurements hands feet more accurate measurement body fat . scale part works normal , but body fat measurement higher 20 - 30% , compared tanita bc554 scale or omron hbf-306c hand held . omron , replaced unit , but new one also inaccurate . now , i'm tying get my money refunded , but omron not want take unit back	-1
these hair topia pills nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used buy them . i first bought these pills last year june 2005 after hair formula 37 unsuccessful promise producing longer stronger hair four months usage . well , these pills not expensive previous brand mentioned , promised also change dry brittle hair into long healthy , it absolute nothing . i said myself , like hair formula 37 , maybe i just need give this more time , so i bought 2-month supply gave it 3 months all there no difference all . this product might just work others , which it , but it certainly didn't work me . i must admit i brought this myself , my mother warned me not buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they nothing hair grows naturally anyway , if you really want get hair pills then just buy them whole lot cheaper regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins damn dollar store ! thus , i am here warn others not waste their precious money . if you going , please don't it this site-you buy this product little cheaper hairboutique.com .	-1

i disappointed getting this product because i've read previous reviews majority written positive feedback this hair iron . i actually prefer cheaper conair ceremanic irons w/o wet on/off feature over this one . it doesn't clamp down well my hair ( i've got thick frizzy hair ) . results me aren't great , it straightens my hair little but it still frizzy . it lightweight which nice . i don't care wet hair option because it takes me twice long straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .	1
i this model , or least it looked same , few years it worked exceptionally well . it finally broke down recently i thought i lucky enough find it again , but they must changed product significantly because it not work very well all . actually , it virtually useless it only partially gets job , which , course like not it all	-1

tylenol over-the-counter medication contains its active ingredient " acetaminophen " . acetaminophen analgesic drug treats mild moderate pain , making it great headache reliever , or medication treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc . it also acts reduce fever . acetaminophen commonly used place aspirin those allergic aspirin . one drawback acetaminophen it not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it limited use arthritis swelling reduction ) . it few side-effects . those liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , it hard liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out favor due incidence reye syndrome aspirin children . tylenol manufacturer proprietary name acetaminophen . there generic form acetaminophen also sold over counter , this version much cheaper than " tylenol " , container usually contains more tablets/pills , etc . generic form acetaminophen just effective tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen combined other medications dual action . example , tylenol pm diphenhydramine ( active ingredient benadryl ) , which causes sedation acts like good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also anti-histamine , so it work itching allergies too . tylenol packaged different strengths : extra-strength 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , children dose 80 mg . tylenol may also packaged timed-release version , called " extended release " . rather than tablet dissolving all once stomach , tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout digestive tract . all all , acetaminophen great product . if you want " name brand " acetaminophen , tylenol your brand ( although it cost more ) . my choice generic brand it cheaper dozen . jim " konedog " koenig	1

this review oral-b flexisoft replacement heads . coupled braun electric toothbrushes , this one most effective aids oral hygiene ever developed . my introduction oral-b goes back over 27 years usaf basic training briefing ; dental technician held up oral-b toothbrush medium bristles said " this toothbrush you need if you want keep your teeth " or some such statement like . well , i haven't lost one yet . motorized mechanicals toothbrush most work while you guide oscillating round head around over your pearly whites . while heads undeniably pricey when looked just dollars cents , there value fact total package actually makes rather mundane chore little more fun while actually living up claim it better job your teeth than manual brushing . since i've always believed entire surface area toothbrush head meant covered toothpaste size head these smaller than average brush , i know i'm using less toothpaste same job . while this no big deal , long term economic benefit plaque under control , healthy gums bright smile full natural teeth . it kind hard deny it works since my dentist confirmed positive results upon direct examination . just careful what model these brush heads you selecting watch pricing . oral-b uses kind color code bristles , ones colored indicator bristles line shaft flexisoft model seems equate medium hardness . enjoy life	1

this price , we got pedometers whole family . my 9 year old son worn his every day since . it interesting see how many steps you take day . we not set pace length recommended , but other than , it ready use immediately - just clip it onto your waistband . shows steps , miles calories burned . my only complaint front cover little hard flip open	1
i really liked this product , so smooth , noiseless . very easy use also less efforts required remove hair ...... i go again it .....	1
i surprised open this pedometer page after sometime see all negative reviews it receives . i using this specific model more than 3 months now i am really satisfied it . it really accurate ( lt ; 1% declination , i performed more than four tests more than 400 steps during different times its life i seen couple cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly belt or pants , displays time conveniently nice backlight , even radio which works , although most people said , not really its best feature . truth i am not using radio all , mostly because i believe batteries last longer it save me extra trips walmart . but i tested it it works , although nothing impressive there . course , money , i think you cannot go wrong this pedometer . one funny comment , although most people complain it cannot open very easily , after sometime it open more easily you think . actually it couple times where putting bag my shoulders or waist pouch applying some pressure it mistake , open it wide , so it not count any steps . but it not open itself anyway , needs external force this happen , so it not happen often . all all , i am sure plastic construction less than rigorous production testing result many pieces not function properly result bad reviews . maybe i lucky , maybe not , but this one best most reliable devices i carry use every day . great incentive walking exercising more	1

this brush performs well . however , use it 3 weeks take look inside--it filled bacteria grime . this stuff very difficult remove , especially inside part holds brush . this not good because same bacteria comes out your mouth reinfect your mouth every time you brush . it tends stay wet inside brush which makes great place this stuff thrive . only toothpaste work this overpriced crest toothpaste . i only use colgate total ( triclosan ) so i never bothered adding cartridge after first few . don't fooled -- using this brush not replace need flossing . save some money get normal sonicare brush without toothpaste	1

i've owner several remington express sets my lifetime . all them worked wonderfully . my issue these rollers isn't their quality - they work excellently , heat up quickly very compact store . only problem instead pins , they come clippy-type holders keep them your hair . i suppose clips would work okay if you fine , short medium length hair . i shoulder length hair that not very thick , clip holders would not keep rollers my hair . i could only put very small section hair around roller if i any hope it staying put my head . most time clips would pop off roller would fall out if i so much turned my head . remington set compact express rollers called " all " , which almost identical function , only they come pins instead clips . if you're looking something quality , compact easy use stay your hair until you're ready take them out , i'd recommend set instead this one	-1

i exclusive norelco shaver user past 7 years . my first 6756x advantage which i still use occasionally , followed few years later norelco 8894xl spectra . both these shaver still work well . reason i purchased new 7775x because after 7 years use my 6756x only hold charge few shaves , otherwise works perfectly . although i my new 7775x shaver short time , it seems provide close shave my old unit . pros : 7775x more secure changing base than old unit ( deeper ) . message display provides good status shaver include battery charge which old unit not indicate until it near depleted . unit still maintains shaving cream/gel dispenser . this especially useful it you travel frequently like i . no more worries my shaving cream confiscated . cons : if you primarily use shaver dry then rinse indicator useful . my purchasing in/out shower shavers ability always use it wet some type cream or gel . i find closeness shave equal any bladed razor i ever used , without nicks cuts . i would not recommend suspending shaver supplied plastic hanger strap which not near secure my old unit . it looks like it could easily disconnected allowing unit fall possibly break . overall , i am very satisfied my new 7775x . i expect it provide same long life service close shave my old unit . i would recommend you keep you unit clean charged required most importantly change shaver heads once year , recommended . doing so should provide same long live close shave i enjoyed over years . happy shaving !	1

i love 4 blades . it really very close shave , but hardly feels like you're shaving . it just glides over your legs ( knees ) , first time i used it i check make sure it working , i'm so used feeling scraping or resistance when i shave my legs . it doesn't cut my legs or armpits no matter what kind rush i'm , shaves faster because i never need go over spots i already shaved . blades also seem last longer without changed , so it worth money . two thumbs up product actually lives up advertising . also , packaging crazy thick plastic encases everything now , but there serated edge surrounding razor makes it easy open ! you don't need scissors or your cleaving knife , just couple fingers open it up :	1
