yum ... play food ! this great set . i buy it soon i find it . this great set ! lots cans ( good storage ) , ice cream , boxed treats , cookies , ( yummy ) , course , much more . who could resist spaghetti meatballs ? chocolate chips ice cream ? oh my gosh , it better than i thought . you might think good time , your child needs 40 dollar melissa doug wooden play food real cutting noises fisher price 100 dollar kitchen imaginative play . bullpies , i say . i tons dollar-store food . i ultra-realistic foam food kitchen set i got . i prefer dollar store food . dollar store food better because it more one package , looks real , cheap , pretty durable , looks nice . i really silly play food set came stovetop ( small , but knobs turn ! ) , pink purple propane tank , " barracuda " ( seriously ) , " barracuda hash " which included barracuda , ham eggs , chicken , turkey , potpie , more eggs . but logo spam hotdog , front it beans , turkey , fish , sausage , lots weird meat . but it says " eatable , 100% dainty , present !, daintiness , dainty " . just wanted let you know . so , bottom line , dollar store play food much better than you think it . it comes lots things expensive companies would never dreamed	1

i bought this my daughter her 11th birthday . after playing game once , she asked me if i could take it back . she said game boring because it so limited far what you could game . my daughter always played lot " simulated life " video games ( i.e. , sims , animal crossing ) online games ( i.e , club penguin ) . i suspect this why she found this game limiting . other games she played portray more intricate " life " therefore draw player greater degree . my advice would consider what your daughter used before buying this . if your daughter no experience these types games , this game probably fine . however if your daughter previously played simulated life games , she probably find this one lacking .	1

fine print box tells you this " multi-terrain " vehicle , instead " all terrain " vehicle , this because while they advertise it go through sand , grass , mud , what they actually mean it go through dry sand , such you would find desert , dry grass , such you would find african savannah , dry mud , such you would find their fertile imagination . mine shorted out stopped working just going through dewey grass .	1

this appealed me since i would able use it longer than standard mobile , but it ended up not working when we wanted it anyways . i liked idea , but just doesn't work . this mobile constantly stops working ( before 8 minutes up ) ... it stops going round . music continues lights still , but base stops rotating , it seems though it always gets " stuck " we push it get " unstuck " . we've changed battery doesn't seem help base keeps getting stuck , i contacted mattel get voucher since it more than 90 days since i bought this , can't return it store .

i bought this table my almost 8 month old who starting pull up things . i thought this would safe her learn stand because it hand grippers sides table ( just purpose ) recommended ages 6 months+ . all fun shapes , colors , sounds immediately caught her attention . she cawled over it when she tried pull herself up it fell over ontop her . she bumped her head cried , but fortunately , wasn't hurt . i put rug under it thinking maybe would help make it more stable , but soon she tried pull up again ( within 5 minutes taking it out box ) it fell over her again . top table very heavy , but legs not very sturdy , making it topheavy easy topple . needless say , i took it back store . i would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted take legs off use it floor , or if you toddler who very steady standing his own . personally , i think recommended age should changed older children or this toy should recalled legs redesigned .	-1

" video game " which you assume move quickly , you'd better set aside lease hour play it . you exhausted when you're through . we suggest they go back drawing board stop all pauses , play some theme music when you choosing your case , show girl who opens your case , audience clap - anything !!!!!!!! if you buy this game , you only yourself blame . p.s. i won $ 750,000 didn't even care , i just glad it over	-1

this very mediocre knights kingdom set . there not much interest going here , small castle suffers lazy design . colorful knights morcia back , once again fighting against vladek , black knight . two good knights make appearance here ( blue purple ) , we also get vladek , dark soldier , skeleton . minifigs charismatic ever , each sporting his own unique expression . vladek his henchman cute " i'm evil " lego frown . our knights outfitted usual accessories . swords shields , black hatchet henchman . scene small mountainside castle home large scorpion monster . creature constructed mixture regular technic parts , he hinged pieces articulated tail pincers . blue knight accompanied his horse , who cute mini-catapult strapped his side . scorpion fit into his den base castle , which front gate raised lowered . high atop tower mini-catapult thin boom crane small barred jail cell dangling precariously it . rest castle just walls , floors , staircase . this castle very fragile . mine fell apart several times while i working building it . whole , design just isn't all great . handle care , play care . colors mostly black , dark gray , dark red , brown . this set one those nice walls barred window , some signature knights kingdom battlement pieces . this set works addition vladek dark fortress . its own , it stunningly less impressive . good news savvy lego maniac take castle parts build better castle them . my verdict : one thumb up scorpion monster ( who added your other knights kingdom adventures ) , one thumb down rest . could've better . my advice get vladek dark fortress . it more than worth price admission . those still hungering more knights kingdom action after vladek fortress built conquered , this set better than nothing	-1

we got this when our son 4 months old first he love it . there slight rubber\plastic smell everything tub time tub but we thought it would fade time . well six months later smell still there our son ended up stop playing most bath toys except squirting bath buddies . we all precautionary steps keep bath toys clean yet they grew mold very short amount time . playtime tub toys good except teething sailing boats which also rubber smell . plus stacking tubs not make practical storage because lids too flimsy . there some good points this product but i feel it not worth $35 price tag . guess that why it clearance store . it combination quality price made me give it only 2 stars .	1

although this new release barbie looks very much like real life singer , doll itself not something i would recommend child under 12 . doll dressed pretty sccantilly adorned realistic jewlerly . it also comes bracelet appropriate teen . short hair this doll tight clothing not lend itself childs play more suited serious doll collector or mcbride fan	1
i bought leappad plus writing impulse store , wanting help my son writing , phonics , etc . he used it few times , but i almost beg him use it ... that sad . i wish i would gotten original leappad or perhaps even leapster . one thing , book doesn't recognize all pencil movements . child could make incorrect number or letter , it doesn't seem leappad would recognize it . also , child keep erasing over over , providing limited usage . not only , there only few books published leappad writing mind , exercises repetitive ( e.g. writing number 6 ten times ) . i've bought quite few leappad books quantum pad books my son , he just not interested after initial use . i'm sure he learned little bit phonics using phonics books such , but i think he learns more workbooks bought bookstore or department store -- they're cheaper ! not only leappad books very short ... much shorter than workbooks you buy . considering leappad books usually around $15 pop -- amazon doesn't carry/list them all there very limited selection stuff mar t-t ype stores ( least , that case my geographical area) -- you may want re-consider investing leappad system .	1

i gave this my fiance christmas , who loves sudoku video games , so i thought it would brilliant combination . he excited , but frustrated how not easy it play . he can't always tell where cursor board , so if he sets it down minute , he can't see where he left off . then when he playing semi-dark while we train , he couldn't see anything either ( backlight would nice feature ) . it just seems this model not designed very intuitively : he keeps wanting press clear change number , but it clears game . all say , 2 million puzzles sounds great ... unless it too frustrating play	1

this car pictured could base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these going 100.00 less web . if you havent noticed differences packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots people dont notice . heres differences below ... these 5 cars there two versions each driver(5 different drivers ) made . first versions or base version second versions or " added features " version . first versions no " added features " stickers you cannot race any two ( or more ) cars 5 different drivers ' cars same time ! dale sr. dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson tony stewart cars first versions ( no added features ) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot changed . speed steering straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed either it goes full or it doesnt . same reverse gear . again , each 5 different drivers ' cars made two different versions same car one more features than other . updated or " added features " versions " added features " stickers . those " added features " ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you turn transmitter wheel slightly car turns little . turn transmitter wheel alot car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back trigger little car moves little , pull back trigger all way car takes off ! this also works reverse gears well now if this isnt cool enough ... each " added features " car different frequencies different drivers ' car . transmitters cars different well . " added features " version transmitter two " trim " adjustments back remote well frequency chip side remote than changed , also changed chassis car . so if you own 2 tony stewart cars , you would frequency pack race them same time . now , two or more different drivers ' cars race together ( or five people race 5 different cars ) . no two alike cars race together unless you " frequency car transmitter " change it , or " frequency pack " team up inc . all 5 frequency chips not come car box , off shelf . this " frequency pack " sold seperately ! you also purchase tires , suspension parts body hold down clips , fully painted ready use new spare or other drivers ' teams bodies , extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i lots research these cars should you any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co	1

i bought these my 13-year old niece , who loves percussion , so excited get them christmas . they looked like great buy . well , disappointment palpable two hours later . we got them hooked up , installed appropriate batteries etc ., light , but we could not get any sound drumsticks all . which bummer , but ok , if we could simply either ( 1 ) get help or ( 2 ) easily replace them . nope . " instructions " tiny folded sheet paper , there absolutely no troubleshooting , no help , no nothing . i went through everything came them but could find anything help us next steps or returns , etc . i finally retrieved original plastic packaging found url tiny letters company . but when i went there , site again offered no help , tips , or troubleshooting ( just pdf really awful original instructions ) . there video website showing someone playing drumsticks but this no help us trying troubleshoot ( except mildly disappoint my niece when she realized you drum " air " get best results -- which we try , no luck or sound , again ) . i next e-mailed company got no response . i e-mailed them again -- seven days later -- e-mail ( badly worded english ) simply asked me if we tried " plugging head phones . " seriously . anyway , not waste your money . terrible product , no support , no recourse if it doesn't work it should	-1

if you run spellcaster deck , buy good cards individually because my opinion , i rarely get good cards out this booster	1
our daughter became this she baby . we tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach moment like it , but she always wanted go out after 1 or 2 minutes . maybe other babies diferent , but i think its not right material such playground . hot environment like ours south , it quickly gets very hot inside you not leave your baby or little child alone playing because plastic material dangerous . we finally sealed holes bottom not pump up upper part so we fill it water use it litle pool , thats only way us use it	1
ok , maybe that bit strong , but this hands down our most hated toy ( adults , kids plenty frustrated , too ) . we received it gift ( wow whoever would pay $35 this crazy . ) . our son nearly five needs help load truck , which loaded fully work without jamming ; time-consuming procedure , since dominoes loaded one-at-a-time . dominoes themselves also almost too lightweight stand well end , prone easy collapse . after initial newness wears off this toy going disappear , that something i've never even contemplated before	-1

hideaway bought my daughter who loves it . easily assembled , up within 60 seconds . i noticed there two loops attached hideaway , presumably tie some rope them then stake ground . there no rope or stakes purchase , i am unaware if these should included . two entrances into hideaway , front inverted entrance great . however , rear porthole type entrance , not good children when playing games they trip material bottom . material not durable , but care there should no issues . lot bigger than it looks site , which nice surprise .	1
i bought this game fly cause cover illustration looked so interesting i couldn't resist . instructions little confusing understand first , but once gameplay started it picked up pretty easy much fun enjoyed everyone . game geared those ages 10 up , but it so easy understand so much fun , my 8 year old neice able play without teaming up adult . game promotes math skills which huge plus since many games today only fun . this game it all , fun , education artwork cards fantastic . when we played , we threw chocolate gold pieces so we'd real pirate plunder everyone speak like pirate . it really great way spend quality time your family it fun all ages	1
i so excited get time tracker am now so frustrated it . first one i got not work all ... they sent second one this one worked less than 5 minutes ( we tried 3 different sets new batteries ) . it such great concept , but unfortunately very poorly made . i also surprised how cheap looking whole thing real life .	-1

if one good thing said dread pirate , it physical game components reek quality . cloth game board , glass jewels , metal coins , wooden dice pewter game pieces all come together give overall sense realism game . it pity , however , game itself isn't nearly exciting pieces . dread pirate relies entirely random dice rolls determine every single outcome game . move place place , you roll dice . challenge player " skirmish " ( which how you steal their treasure ) , you roll dice . steal jewels enemy port , you roll dice . trade jewels port , you roll dice . there absolutely no semblance any real strategy this game . you win accumulating most treasure , amount treasure you accumulate depends entirely how lucky you your roll dice . this game not fun , even frustrating , especially young child who keeps rolling low numbers . there some thinking involved ... you need judge yourself who you should attack when , but even if you make best possible strategic decision , you still lose die roll end up empty-handed . i would recommend dread pirate only if your family specifically looking game where you don't think , only if your children mature enough deal bad luck ( good/bad luck only way win/lose this game ) . if you're looking enjoyable family game everyone play , i would very much reccommend cranium over this . it less expensive , there alot more it , it your family getting up , active , laughing out loud ( instead sitting around rolling dice determine number jewels you take )	-1

" it doesn't let child know they getting close it until they see it . my daughter gave up it quickly because she would wandering house aimlessly without any clue it where abouts . i not recommend this toy any one . i would given it no stars , but she like bear itself . yourself favor ... buy care bear ( much cheaper ) , hide it somewhere , you truthfully tell your child when they " getting warmer !	-1

we bought this gadget our 2-year old . risk sounding like broken record -- or faulty spinning plastic toy , this case--i'll just add my vote design flaws : 1 . volume . not only volume loud , it unbearably so . even my daughter grabs her ears when she playing it . voice bit garbled well , so when command ' ready .. spin!' sounds more like ' wordy ... spew!' i prefer spare my daughter hearing loss live concerts her teenage years , so i've disabled on/off switch . 2 . spin quality . sit ' spin should fluid , effortless motion ( like lazy susan ) . this toy requires enormous effort turn . add my daughter frustation , handle base gives bit ( even screws tightly fastened ) , making tedious experience rather than joy ride we loved kids . spare expense frustration fitting this thing garbage collection day -- buy easel finger paint kit instead .	-1
i though this shark would bigger . i bought same one gift shop ri 99 cents 2 years ago	1
friend mine zombies !!!, also twilight creations . i've played it few times , found it pretty enjoyable . zombietown sort followup this some ways , tries expand strategy game somewhat . unfortunately , it ends up far too confusing complicated make fast gameplay ( it often very slow , fact ) , strategy more shallow than risk . ya know stereotypically confusing instructions insert tab into slot ? that pretty much what instructions this read like . they're fairly poorly written boot . there also couple problems we ran into rules didn't seem cover . i can't recall them off top my head , they didn't come up very often , but it still irritating . overall , definetly not reccomended . $40 stores , $35 off amazon , it also huge ripoff . what you get box ? like 100 tiny army men-esque figures , couple packs cards , laminated piece cardboard . i understand why it expensive , i'm sure this low budget item such , but zombies !!! much less expensive .	1

this pretty much kid vs kid only . adults cannot play . you make it into solo game one child , but its really more like flash cards spelling if you . product basically set flash cards spelling , some letter cubes kids spell out words . rules propose two games , which basically see if kids spells word right , they get keep card if they , first kid 5 cards wins . adults pretend play if child younger " fall it . " it really works game only if there two kids same age playing . i don't know , but i can't see my daughter pulling this out when friend comes over . therefore , extent this set flash cards spelling , its kind expensive what it . don't get me wrong , you definitely make it into learning tool . your call .	1

my son loves color wonder line crayola , so when i saw they came out new creation called color explosion , which marker-type product , i knew i try it . now , i wish i'd saved my money . first off , you should know this product not preschoolers . color explosion recommended children 6-years up . now i've played it , i concur . i came upon this product when arrangements made watch my 9 10-year old nieces week . i thought color explosion would hit , i planned treat them this " art " related project throughout week . they excited try it , once i settled monkey boy , my 5-year old , project his own , we got started . first glance , it looked winner . girls fun . then , we started page , markers became icky . gummy probably better description . markers covered black film , which caused images look splotchy , streaky . crayola suggests you wipe markers off paper towel , so we . it kept happening . instance , we'd draw short line , then we'd wipe film off again . then , we tried wipe off images paper towel . didn't help either . color explosion too painstaking child activity . we began realize it wasn't blast , but bummer . crayola warns against moisture , but even fingerprints spear pages , film comes off onto your hands , table , everything else . oh , if you use glitter set , it clumps , mixes film , makes liquidy black goo stains fabrics . company warns staining , suggests washing immediately , but come . they even test market this product ? what i thought would entertaining venture , turned out messy disappointment .	-1

it christmas day , believe me , only thing would get me sit down computer level dissatisfaction i've thomas battery powered engines . these trains derail constantly . i think it because all four wheels power , front wheels too much traction , so they able climb out grooves . took me all night set up really cool track , they derail every 40 seconds or so . read : 3 year old yelling train . thank goodness i also bought brio battery powered engine well ( polar express one ) . it works much better . it not derailed once all morning . it also better following ways : 1 ) it shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power , 2 ) it go into freewheel mode when you want use it without power , 3 ) it goes reverse , 4 ) it makes train sounds , 5 ) coupling other cars swivel which means it less likely derail more likely maintain magnetic connection , 6 ) it comes batteries installed . if " santa claus " not disposed all packaging last night , i would return all battery operated thomas trains go brio ones . note : there good thomas battery powered car which jet engine . this jet engine swivel , seems not derail , maybe because it pushes other cars front it	-1

i am breast cancer survivor i find this pink dressed , blond " doll " perfection rather insulting my female self , perfect perky boobs , long blond hair , body not exist woman after ravages chemotheraphy . i perfectly understand mattel wanting support breast cancer research donate portion proceedes towards funding ( thank you your generosity ) , but it under guise selling " doll " which not reflect community women who experienced challenges recovery survivorship ... doll which not look like survivor literally painful insulting ! why doesn't this doll wig ? why doesn't she breast removed ? why doesn't she bra fitted form mimic shape breast ? what wrong reality ? why can't mattel acknowledge true nature this disease make doll which comforts , not insults sensibility women who suffered this disease . i purchase this doll , just because i am horrified product itself . i disrobe her , saw , cut off her breast so she look more like me , survivor , woman pride . i dismantle construct supposed beauty make this image more like my own - because i am what woman , not facade false construction .	-1

if it up my children , they would rate this stuff 5+ stars . they love it they totally entertained it . it one only times they play quietly without fighting . mom , other hand , hates it you know it bad when toy gives mom some free time peace quiet she wants no part it !!! this stuff sticks everything anything-including your children . you can't believe mess it makes . imagine billions tiny little balls stuck everything your house . i confine it their playroom , but it follows them everywhere they go . you find it all over your house everything-you can't escape it . product itself , it definitely doesn't dry out , but it also doesn't hold together well described making it quite difficult make objects it claims you make package . once you put colors together it impossible separate them out they tiny millimeter balls . playdooh may dry out if left out , but it doesn't make anywhere near mess this stuff it also molds much better than playfoam ! my advice stick your playdooh	-1
when this toy turned it seriously sounds like air-raid siren going off . i can't use my usual trick putting tape over speaker because you need able hear instructions play games . also , counting/shape game confusing . there row shapes numbers them , game asks child , example , find 3 rectangles . it trying get child press rectangle shape three times , but rectangle shape marked number 8 . there circle marked number 3 . only reason i'm not giving this one star because my son enjoys playing " repeat tone " " count villians " games . i'm not sure how much longer adults house handle siren noise , though , i may try hide this get him leapfrog toy instead	1

i can't put it any better than others before me . i lot research before purchasing this train am so glad i decided spend little bit more money ton more quality . this truly heirloom train set around longer than i ( i'm only 35 ) . other reviewers also correct advising you shop around before purchasing this train set . prices vary wildly . yes , it hurts little spend this kind money train set when you know there others out there . however , others cheaper reason ... they're junk . you simply can't better than this set	1
my 2 year old 4 year old love this playdoh set . i recommend it highly	1
this game so much fun !!! i think maybe it could use few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels . other words ... if you huge star wars fan like me , then you love this game !!! it keep you occupied least hour day if you determined beat certain level . thing i think it could use maybe game-save function or something ... anyway , great gaming experience !!! one half thumbs up !!!	1
someone gave these us when my son 9 months old . he loved holding them it fun watching him learn " color " develop his hand-eye coordination . he now 22 months old we've just used them up i buy crayola tub crayons because i couldn't find these toys us . crayola crayons thinner ( which doesn't hold up well toddler abuse ) more colors , but i like these better because they come ducky sponge wash crayon off walls ( my son loves part , too ) . these crayons surefire way get my son into bathtub	1
my 2 year old daughter ( our 4 6 year old neighbors ) love this toy ! i it up during my daughter second birthday party all kids loved it ! it holds up very well i only refill it once ( only because one kids managed pull out plug ) . some balls not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine my daughter best time this . it up living room not outside so keeps it getting any other holes . i would recommend this any kids around 4 or under . one thing keep mind ; kids may afraid it first ; my daughter terrified it first day but second she loved it now she spends lot time there	1

my 6-year-old got this christmas he his 4-year-old brother love it ! they enjoy doing battles coming up different monster combinations . it teaches strategy since they figure out which combinations work best . my kids also like just play figures themselves like action figures . piece advice though : this game only comes 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't much fun since point create varying combinations . therein lies problem - or least my problem ! i can't find extra figures this thing ! luckily , they available around christmas so i got some then , but now i can't find them stock anywhere . also , i not any durability problems although i some sound quality problems 2nd day . fortunately , it turned out all i needed new batteries . you really need alkalines this game . overall , it what my boys think though they adore this !!!	1

ok , this toy not deserve 5 stars but other reviews far too harsh . first 30 minutes my chihuahua terrified this thing worth price . stuffed animal it very cute but not too cuddly because it hard plastic under fur . i love scrat movie sounds this thing makes quite funny first but get boring soon unless you family pet terrorize like i . here trick . put scrat pillow your hadn behind him so you make him move wiggle his tail without seen , then someone bring family pet . when i lunged dog feet he screamed run through meet grinder . this may sound cruel but i assure you dog not hurt now enjoys showing scrat who boss whenever we turn him	1
my three girls ages 3 7 liked this toy when added their pretend food collection . we didn't use it game . you place different frosting sprinkle combination pieces onto different colors donuts make different varieties . each would take turn ' ordering ' types donuts others would ' make ' them . yes , frosting won't stay if donut turns over but fits easily works great plate pretend play ! box flimsy but we just keep all pieces our general play food bin so not issue . would buy this again . great kids imaginations	1

this great doll -- we gave it our 2-year-old daughter last week she now carries her everywhere , feeds her , reads her , puts her bed , covers her blanket , obsessively pats her back tush . she quite cuddly soft ; you'll want hold her yourself . you might expect pictures arms legs would hard plastic like head , but fact they very soft pliable , trunk body all cloth , like pillow , bean-bag tushie . headband removable but actually stays there pretty well . eyes don't those stupid eyelids you usually see baby dolls , ones open shut when you lift doll , always seem stop working properly after couple weeks . we'll see how " maria " holds up kind punishment our daughter mete out , but she seems pretty durable . what great purchase !	1

all peek blocks fun . although each set different ' theme ' they very similar enjoyable play . these blocks great fun . each block something interesting inside it . our house these played boys pretty roughly times . windows see inside still clear not one these blocks broken . so i would say they sturdy hold up well normal play . ends each block texture . within each block something interesting . many blocks activity associated it- push button make noise , twist knob make something turn around etc . one thing i would warn these blocks not stack well , particularly tall towers . so if you thinking buying these tower building , i'd consider different set blocks . otherwise , these excellent toys . they provide basis communication vocubulary building your child . they sturdy encourage language , eye hand coordination so . if you enjoy toys fairly quiet , more than push button make noise , foster independent creative play exploration world this excellent toy . enjoy .	1

my daughter 12 dancing princess party she loved game . it little tricky her set up , but she enjoys playing it	1
my children loved this toy all ( 1 ) hour . my only complaint material . you probably guess this punctured almost immediately . i made sure clear debris beforehand it seems something very small wounded this toy . i've refilled it but i'm little apprehensive where let my kids use this . it seems it takes very little disable this toy .	1
we've one house few years now . kids ( 5 2-1/2 ) love it . it soft , cuddly , sized just right them . it taken all over place , provided companionship them many long trip ( including two south korea ) , given comfort when they sad , used countless hours make-believe . its worth far more than what paid it	1
this one few toys , it seems , which remained fundamentally unchanged since we children . push-stick shaped little differently ( i remember thin blue broom stick orange or red handle ) but otherwise , it same . no electronic sounds or flashing lights added - although you get it way , too , if you want . personally i think these things detract imagination building aspects certain toys . i'm not saying we no talking or musical or flashing toys , but it dismays me when these things added classics ( think little people farm etc ) . what i love this toy it anything . it sweeper ! it carpet cleaner ! it mop ! it never fails crack me up when my son comes running after me his corn popper when i am cleaning . it lawnmower ! so many jobs around house or yard copied corn popper . if mom or dad isn't up much , it still great fun run around which means exercise kiddies . it solo toy playing-with-other-kids toy . any time we other children over play , corn popper comes out they chase each other house . we got this toy when my son 13 months . he now 3y4m still playing this toy . i seen 5 6 year olds still playing corn popper . there few toys so simple yet offer so much fun . sturdy , too - very important it bound crashed into few walls . i can't think toy which give you more bang your buck - unless you count dirt measuring spoons all those other free things kids so exasperatingly pick over toys you paid good money . i am little alarmed current price listed this toy , though . you should not need pay much it . occasionally this item becomes hard find - especially christmas - but usually there tons them stores around cost president hamilton . right now this listed twice .	1

star wars trivial pursuit saga edition ( 2005 . ) introduction :d espite around since middle seventies , star wars series never declined its popularity . george lucas created science fiction phenomenon stood test time , then some . needless say , many games based series - video games , role-playing games , no shortage board games adapted star wars universe . 1998 , star wars trivial pursuit released . die-hard fan series , it far my favorite ( non video game ) star wars game ever . unfortunately , it outdated fast , due fact it didn't cover prequel trilogy it immediately followed . but 2005 , seven years three star wars episodes later , new version game hit store shelves ! read my review new version star wars trivial pursuit . overview : quite honestly , who doesn't know what trivial pursuit ? well , those you who living under rock all your life , here concept behind game . players alternate rolling die moving their game token across wheel-shaped board . there six different-colored spaces . each color represents different category . player then asked question category . if he or she gets it right , he or she goes again . if he or she misses it , it next player turn . six spots board wedge spaces . objective game gain wedge all six colors return central hub wheel , answer game-winning question . some changes this edition game , rather obviously , questions overall game design star wars based , two dvds , which contain wedge game-winning questions . new concept game includes player able " steal " if player unable answer wedge question , last few seconds time . essentially , game play stays play classic stylings trivial pursuit , but gives it star wars overhaul . other words , this game exactly what it says it . review : original star wars trivial pursuit , without question , my favorite star wars game all time wasn't video game . this new version massive improvement over old version . starters , new version covers entire star wars film saga . classic galactic civil war trilogy ( episodes iv , vi ) prequel clone wars trilogy ( episodes i , ii , iii ) all get equal emphasis . if you hated original version not covering prequel trilogy , problem , obviously , corrected , major way . dvds also add nice new twist game . it good finally method setting wedge questions apart regular questions . , course , you anywhere two four players or teams . i few minor complaints , though . first all selection tokens characters you play . original version luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , darth vader . other words , nice assortment main characters . new version luke skywalker , darth vader , obi-wan kenobi , yoda . other words , only jedi characters . this strictly cosmetic flaw , but still , i think they could picked better assortment characters than those four . complaint inclusion die . those you who never played original version game , it included electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces move when you tapped its head , via lcd screen . i liked better than rolling die because it helped give game unique star wars feel playing die just doesn't . problem price game - i've seen it everywhere $45 $60 ! even lowest msrp , it still rip off . one biggest problems one most obvious - if you're not die-hard star wars fan , you not get very far this game . my last biggest complaint questions themselves - like original game , they horribly imbalanced . some questions so simple , casual fan could answer them easily . some so difficult , even die-hards trouble them . this brings me my complaint dvd questions . not only these questions really no more difficult than card questions , but time ticks down , questions become easier ! this makes it ridiculously easy player " steal " wedge if question receiver unable answer . if i designing game , i'd straighten up these flaws . but i'm not , overall , i am very satisfied it . edition notes : this game fairly recent release , it remains readily available most major stores sell board-style games movie merchandise . if you want game , it shouldn't too hard - just ready pay fairly high price it . overall :d espite some minor issues , this new version star wars trivial pursuit leaps-and-bounds improvement over original game . if you're huge fan series who thinks your knowledge series supreme , don't hesitate buy this game . there many star wars trivia games/books/etc . over years , but star wars trivial pursuit ultimate star wars trivia experience . no fan should pass this game up	1
even better than scrabble , you build words board build words " up " adding letters over existing words . so " tree " becomes " free " " braces " becomes " blades " . scoring might little too easy , but if you're hard core , you use point values scrabble raise score difficulty . board small so you start thinking up instead out fairly soon into game , game doesn't drag too long . it addictive you not look words same way again .	1
i definitely tell when great game show fun board game . unfortunately , absolutely isn't always case . one my all time favorite quiz shows back 80 super password bert convy . game course showcases celebrity regular contestant trying guess their way guess mystery word puzzle . this edition doesn't reflect edition . this board game edition example original password late allen ludden . game still fun enjoyable those who actually haven't seen original password like myself , but it just delightful . unfortunately , it isn't much fun reflecting this version relating bert convy edition . hopefully , when password remade , it just like themed 80 edition nbc game show . price : b-game : 1/2+fun enjoyment : b-overall :	1

x-23 figure availible amazon.com dressed purple but there also black one - variant alot harder find [ i resorted ebay mine ] . build figure great - there so much articulation , it insane ; her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they concealed which beyond cool . articulation , most part , great . my only qualm it it makes her arms look funny but i deal . she barely 6 inches tall , i don't expect her perfect . however , reason i'm giving her three stars because i feel purple outfitted one far inferior black outfitted . i recieved my black clad x-23 first expected same figure but purple my other one but i wrong . black x-23 very dark brown hair lays straight lank while purple x-23 hair jet black windblown which makes her head almost impossible move around . also , thing bothers me most x eyes green black suited version but purple suited version , they're orange . i am big x-23 fan i understand when she " triggered " , her eyes go crazy reddish orange , but that not something i really want see sitting top my computer monitor . it kind creepy ! sidenote , when x-23 wear purple ? her comics she either black , dressed civilain or old wolverine costume [ which you see comic comes x-23 ] . i would've prefered variant wearing wolverine costume while black x-23 mass produced . so , personally , i would recommend hunting down variant x-23 your collection . she looks nicer , i think , more true character	1

my 17 month old enjoys playing this kitchen , mimicking mommy . however , past few months she really shown interest kitchen playsets 2+ child stand while using . she doesn't go this kitchen often she used . her , this toy seemed it prime 3 months ( 12-15 months age ) now she moved next level play . it cute toy introduces toddlers kitchen " ideas " , but it either needs more intrigue or younger age start . i think when she 9 months old or even just sitting up she would fun playing parts it-opening refrigerator/microwave/or oven , hitting stove make music play or turning " water " sink make music play . she may more trouble shape sorter then , but i think toys good grow into . i not recommend this 12-month toy . wait few months buy one 2+	1

" game life one first games i purchased , but i could not more disappointed quality " new improved " game . game i grew up buildings , bridges , houses , etc . permanently embedded into game board . new game , these 3d decorations come off placed board each time you play . this my main complaint new game . every time you accidently knock board or brush one buildings your sleeve , they fall off . add this age-old problems people not staying cars spinner not working properly ( it worse new game , way ) game life becomes game frustration . after one game new game board , our family decided we would not play game again . i am now looking auction sites trying find one " old fashioned " game boards . they really took step backwards this one	-1
over all good gift children but i feel maybe you could added few peices paper . thank	1
i bought this my 8 year old . although it took adult read , understand then teach rules play , once we got basic ( classic ) game figured out , it easy . there advance game too , but it too complicated us . we enjoyed it lot , it makes you plan some thinking , where put your ships . my son always wants more more more when it comes battleship . game talks , it closes up carrying handle . makes it more money than other versions , but it well-made worth price	1
if you enjoyed traditional battleship game , you'll really love this game . my only complaint voice announcements bit garbled times . there repeat option hear them again , we used one ! overall , lot fun	1
parker brothers ' classic game , sorry !, one those board games should every household . updated form indian game parcheesi , sorry ! competitive game revenge where players race first get all four their pawns into their " home " square board . game play simple : player turn , he or she draws card middle board . cards numbered 1-12 , there also several special " sorry ! " cards . most numbered cards indicate how many spaces forward player move one his pawns , although some cards special instructions . if player draws card numbered 1 or 2 , they move pawn start onto game board . ( 2 card also allows players draw again . ) 4 card indicates player must move pawn backwards four spaces . if player draws 7 , he option splitting move two pawns . 11 gives player chance switch places opponent pawn . sorry ! card lets player take pawn start place it same square opponent pawn , bumping opponent back start . game play get very fierce intense players race around board , trying first get all four pawns home . if one player pawn bumps into player pawn game board , bumped pawn go back start-which make players really competitive vengeful . sorry ! just one those games everyone should their closet . it easy enough kids play , but it fun grown-ups , too .	1
i remember reading lotr i loved series peter jackson version . once i heard monopoly edition lotr , i excited . i soon won lotr monopoly edition . i came home , invited some relatives soon great time ! you know , monopoly game inwhich you ultimate monopoly . you buy sell property , if you own mt . doom bara-dur ( boardwalk park place original monopoly ) then you get monopoly . you build strongholds ( houses ) fortresses ( hotels ) everytime rival lands your property , then he give you power ( money ) . if you can't pay rent then you'll become bankrupt you out . you also avoid jail . there some new tokens resemble characters lotr . if you look screenshots this monopoly game then you'll notice lot changes . but there new optional rule you play this version ; everytime you roll " eye sauron " ( also counts one ) golden ring move one territory per eye , where you add strongholds . if you land territory ring , you may get it free ! if you land owned territory ring it , you pay double rent . so , if you 100% die-hard lotr only enjoy books , then you miss . but if you looking monopoly board or lotr stuff , i recommend this game thennote : if tolkien lived see this , he would died immediatly . infact , i think he rolling his grave i am typing this review .	1

this product nothing like how i expected it . quality terrible , not waste your money this item	-1
i just got my pink idog today think it just cutest thing . although i am just learning how use it , so far i am just so interested watching it movements colors . problems i encountered it quite difficult " turn " pup off " " button ( nose ) much too sensitive . all you very lightly tap nose pup makes noises . addition , i found batteries pain insert you need screwdriver . i wish like my ipod , there " hold " button avoid accidently activating toy " wasting " expensive batteries . i might make investment buy re-chargable ones avoid cost . anyway , i look forwars using it desk work	1
this comes barely enough paint 2 uses then no info given how get refills store doesn't sell any they don't even tell you what kind paint get . real pain .	-1
description lies , there no minifigures , elite or otherwise , included . unless you money spend additional sets get this vehicle pilot , i wouldn't suggest it anything other then display peice . it shiny though , far i tell mostly accurate game , if not scale other things ( this problem all minifigures ... i suggest 1/6 scale ones instead .	1
this my second purchase , first christmas gift my 2 yr old niece who lives uk . she absolutely adores it , virtual " toys us " environment she lives , this one her favorite toys . it so popular this second purchase birthday gift one her playmates	1
our 19 month old enjoys playing this purse . she enjoys purse itself , cell phone , lipstick most . mirror , keys , wallet , credit card aren't played much . only complaint i she unable open wallet her own . trying open wallet frustrates her no end--it hard young toddler dexterity open such thing	1
entire play tent idea great idea . however , it need little more attention velcro snaps attach tunnels tents together into one unit . it isn't durable enough price . i it out day , my daughter didn't last it . she prefers schoolbus instead . i see this toy breaking down tears very quickly because it little fragile	1
we got this our son month ago . he almost 14 months now , younger than recommended age 3 years , but he never unsupervised when using playhut . our son loves play hide seek ( hiding us , course :)) inside playhut , or just going retrieving balls we toss there him . he doesn't exactly know what basketball hoop yet , but i'm sure come . he lost his balance while playhut knocked it down , but it pops right back up . , since we it up against wall , it more stable anyway . enjoy	1
this set up bit flimsy tunnels don't anything connect them tent . my son still loves it but i wish it bit more sturdy	1
we bought this shopping cart my daughter birthday replace cheapie one she'd before . her previous one cost under $10 ( gift ) there no comparison one little tikes one . old one flimsy get go , faded quickly , when it broke , left sharp edges plastic . little tikes cart much , much sturdier safer . i put it together less than 30 minutes , even my daughter ' help ' . there nice deep basket holds good amount pretend play food or whatever else your child wants push around . seat doll folds against cart just like real shopping cart , easily holds good variety different style dolls . empty shelf under basket nice touch , perfect stashing more groceries . this cart definitely worth extra money , i'd gladly buy it again	1
we bought this cart our 16 month old daughter it hit . she loves pushing her " baby " it filling it " groceries . " i love it so sturdy compared others market very hard tip over . first i wasn't thrilled price but i sold after comparing it others . it very durable high quality . i know this one last .	1
some people hate monopoly , others love it . me , i like it . i've playing it nearly 20 years , ever since i remember . you really should pick up this fantastic board game play it your family children . if you don't , you missing out one amazingly popular game	1
what makes this monopoly version special large tokens difeerent styles houses hotels . i love how they made tokens bigger heavier . also four different styles houses hotels little variety housing . money holder felt it make it little more fancy then standard plastic course case metal instead standard cardboard box . other than it same game . only complaint i i thought looking tin shelf it silver gld colored tin , but it only siver . gold only plastic around tin .	1
we gave this toy our son christmas when he 7 months old he just loved it still almost 1 year old . it fun watching his motor skills improve while using this toy . first he mostly banged noise making nails really grasp ball dropping , storage compartment , crank or spinning ball . little little he added what he could this toy . soon he able get balls out compartment drop them bottom hole , then soon top hole . he now wails little plastic hammer nails just loves it . we haven't replace batteries yet . i highly recommend this toy developing motor skills	1
just wanted write quick review . we older version - we purchased it our daughter when she 9months 2001 !! 4 she still playing it ! it always favorite hers . sometimes we put it away because i thought she wasn't interested it anymore , but when she discovers it or it comes back out , she won't stop playing it .	1
this first real toy we bought my son ( other than real baby toys ) , he 6 months time . moment we brought it home , he loved it ! it comes three balls you drop slot they come rolling out - he never got into part even this day but he loved loves hitting different parts workbench hammer hearing sounds seeing lights flash . it also winding crank some other great little features kids love . now he 20 months although it no longer one main toys he plays i see him go over give it whirl here there i still see same excitment his eyes just like first time . i don't know if i'll ever able get rid this toy not because my son so attached but because i am attached memories his very first toy would hate see it go	1
three us sat down decided try this game we ended up playing 4 hours . it very easy learn yet challenging play . oh , it also lot fun	1
we got this cube before my son born . he enjoyed playing it since he very small . first he would just look it , then he started moving flap bullseye now he grabs all different parts it really manipulates it . different rings sections grab make this great toy child learning reach . my son now six months old he still enjoys this toy	1
our 3 month daughter loves this toy . it multiple shapes colors visual devlopment enough different textures keep her busy while i write this review . very good product	1
my 6 yr . old son received this christmas . he loves it so i ! i think he likes playing hang man best . it cool it light so he play night	1
i came across this item accident while doing my christmas shopping yesterday . not only am i sure my 6 year old son love this ... i love it ! lol ! it really cool . you push top it pops open while wings shoot out . there flashing lights sounds . you put any number codes all beginning bat access games activities . it keyboard it just like real laptop which i am thrilled . now my son type his computer instead mine ! lol ! i played it myself probably half hour . sure there some things he wont able but it wouldnt much fun if he already knew how it . it definately something him awhile . only small complaint i would screen could bigger . size top laptop actual screen used very small . i dont see why they could not utilized more screen still room list bat codes . either way , i am sure any batman fan would love this , any little boy love this ... any mother who looking cool , fun , educational toy love this ! best part me lights you turn . there probably 2 or 3 settings lights help you see screen so much better . great feature well wings which dont really add much except it make any young boy think he something batman might actually use ! i totally reccommend this " toy " anyone boys ages 5 7 or even 8	1
my daughter adores dora asking this toy . she received it christmas thrilled . i love it because it very sturdy toy . babies heavy duty plastic dora half plastic , half cloth . my daughter sleeping dora . she enjoying pretending feed babies put them dora carrier . this toy great play acting well wonderful if you trying get your child ready little brother or sister , although you might want educate your child they won't able carry their new sibling around carrier like dora until they much older	1
let me just say this : my 4 year old certifiable dora nut . she loves her . you could give her bag dora it she'd think it cat meow . but , i must say , mom-mom came through big this toy her 4th birthday . she loves dora feeds twin babies bottle attached her hand . she loves little song dora sings big sister when she presses dora hand . she already singing it around house . feeding accesories cute durable well twin babies themselves all too cute themselves . also , since my four-year old daughter twin well - she twin brother - i think she really relate this toy level well . great toy	1
we 2 these toys - they both same problem others - only says " red pan in/out " if you slam it hard floor it occasionally sing , but this also random . fisher-price rep. not seem surprised when i called report this - told me keep toy i sent me voucher new toy .	1
this toy taught my son how stack day . it such cute toy , my son loves beat everything it . it cute , silly songs , far our toy goes it plays very easy . only thing i don't like spoon , because it doesn't place . if you put it pot then you aren't able sort blocks . overall , it good toy !	1
unlike all bad reviews this doll , i want say how wonderful this doll she everything it says box , i know lot people says she doesn't cry but she it takes while if your child plays her lot feeds her right way she cry , our doll cry every time my daughter squeezes her hand , even my 8 year old son loves make her cry , it over all great doll my daughter dresses her different outfits take her everywhere she goes ...	1

my girls love this kitchen . they play it everyday . it lot storage so you store play food , dishes , etc	1
i bought model refrigerator phone my granddaughter it so precious ! i expecting something screwed together flimsy but kidkraft uses metal screw plugs ( i can't remember what they really called ) put this together it very sturdy screws won't strip out pressed wood . ( it weigh 80 #s ! ) hardware used put this together all organized little tray so it very easy me find what i needed , normally you spend first hour sorting out screws . directions pretty easy follow , i only problems figuring out how attach top but it only took me few minutes get it right . i am woman who my own tools so i tackled this project myself it took me couple hours , if i help it probably would completed much more quickly . ( i recommend tearing off page tray items keep handy so you aren't constantly flipping back page since you need tray items every step . ) my granddaughter eyes lit up when she saw it she played there hours ( she three january loves play pretend ) . this such cute addition her girly room i simply love pastel colors . i love quality design . perfect	1
just purchased this my 7 year old son cerebral palsey- he only use his right hand- this cartridge perfect- game not allow mistakes play this cartridge only one hand not both . since my son use only one hand he trouble playing other vsmile games- he hooked . very engaging also where some other games fall short	1

luckiest outcome prequel trilogy clone wars cartoon . all toys this series fantastic . my daughter literally gasped when i showed her display i'd made . tiger shark gunship good addition line	1
parker brothers ' classic game , sorry !, one those board games should every household . updated form indian game parcheesi , sorry ! competitive game revenge where players race first get all four their pawns into their " home " square board . game play simple : player turn , he or she draws card middle board . cards numbered 1-12 , there also several special " sorry ! " cards . most numbered cards indicate how many spaces forward player move one his pawns , although some cards special instructions . if player draws card numbered 1 or 2 , they move pawn start onto game board . ( 2 card also allows players draw again . ) 4 card indicates player must move pawn backwards four spaces . if player draws 7 , he option splitting move two pawns . 11 gives player chance switch places opponent pawn . sorry ! card lets player take pawn start place it same square opponent pawn , bumping opponent back start . game play get very fierce intense players race around board , trying first get all four pawns home . if one player pawn bumps into player pawn game board , bumped pawn go back start-which make players really competitive vengeful . sorry ! just one those games everyone should their closet . it easy enough kids play , but it fun grown-ups , too .	1
it game * sweet revenge * . who wouldn't like this came , game played decades decades . i remember sitting our sunny sunroom my brother playing when we both children , i am now mother family daycare provider my son ( 6 yrs ) children i care enjoy playing . after school my son older children run get game play instead turning tv 7 times out 10 they pick sorry . this game played children young 3 or 4 yrs children young 101 . this game everyone should own !!! i think i am going go now , get my son game sorry	1
we bought this kitchen my 3 yr old son christmas . after searching through other kitchens we decided this one many reasons . first we liked it not huge overbearing , minimal sounds electronic functions there still plenty room using his imagination which important us . both burners light up , one makes " frying " sound , other " boiling " sound . it compact enough move around easily , we like keep it kitchen well living room outside nice days . secondly we liked chicco got it right regards usually discriminating gender biased kitchen sets pinks purples . subdued primary colors used chicco kitchen making it appealing both genders . lastly price this kitchen bargain compared others out there , especially since we not sure how much my son would really use it . although my son played it company child ease , i would reccomend getting something bigger if you two children constantly playing kitchen it rather small or conjunction other kitchen items placed near it like microwave or coffee pot , so focus not just one item given time	1
after surveying lots kitchen sets , i decided buy star kitchen my kids( 1.5 1.2 years old ) . it turned out great choice . my kids love it , i love it , too .	1
my daughter earlier version one shown so it possible they addressed some these issues : 1 ) most games 1 minute time out which really frustrating my kids2 ) " oh that not so good " - if i hear barbie say one more time i may just throw this thing out nearest window . my daughter get score game she feels really good barbie says , " oh that not so good , but you'll better bit more practice " this broken my daughter down into tears more than once . 3 ) there no parental controls . i wanted turn off or lengthen timer . i expected those sorts features oregon scientific . right now most fun thing my kids it play flower fun game ( like hangman ) type " icup " if you looking newer version this i would strongly recommend playing demo few minutes check it out	1
i bought this my 5 year old son who loves draw . crayons cheap , compared crayola . we tested 10 different reds searching correct " spiderman " red , but they all looked too pink , pretty much same color . also really waxy . oil crayons terrible , totally waxy - no oil all . markers ok ( so far ) , but why provide two each color same thin tip ? they could given broad thin tip marker each color instead . case seem pretty sturdy , so worst case i'll replace contents better quality art supplies . i'm going look around something better ... if i find it , this going back toys us . any ideas ?	1
case cheaply made box wood not even survive shipping . materials contained inside poor quality . rating not deserve one star . i returned it due damage sustained shipping , but it would returned regardless because it garbage !	-1
my 3 year old daughter loves art . she found this toy store i not want buy it because it little pricey art supplies . but she really enjoyed this . it little bit everything it . she used up almost everything it . but she still uses it organize her other arts crafts stuff	1
set great rule book refreshed my memory . item not come color shown . i wanted pink one i got red taupe set . kind disappointing	1
this really fun adults . we get together once month we really enjoy company , food spirits . this meant adults solicize not children . i am sure they might learn somehting gathering . i really enjoyed bunco .	1
all our children love temporary tattoos . this one special because you color them yourself . we purchased this my son 7th birthday it great birthday activity all . needless say , i rest our guests covered art when day through . tattoos stay fairly well if you don't get scrubbing them too hard easy put , they don't stick peel like some we've tried . they offer varied styles tattoos , everything dragons sports . all all this great fun !	1
grandchild loved this gift . her her friends made tattoos everyone . there so many styles choose they really lasted . would buy again minute .	1
i trouble believing this small children . i tried play this party some friends . all us who tried play our 20s 30s , we couldn't figure out how game supposed work . dvd never makes it clear whose turn it or what really happening , there too many things added game original . i've played regular , classic version clue many times enjoy it , but this new version frustrating , complicated , not fun all . i can't imagine children would actually fun this when four adults couldn't even figure out what going	-1
this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1
i always loved b-wings told myself one day i would get one . these new releases caught my eye so i spent my own money get one . i not disappointed . b-wing awesome !!! it copies design features fighter movie very carefully , so it good-looking model actually , b-wing movie pretty ugly , this copies ship movie , but i've played enough video games respect its firepower . i guess it doesn't look too bad . it nice lego , but nothing perfect . here pros cons . pros : good 15 inches tall , this thing monster ! it looks really neatthe service tower nice thing realistic playwith tower display stand , this thing looks cool your bedroomfor huge fighter , it actually easy play withthis thing would probably rock star wars ship battles kids like me its 7 guns . not too hard buildcons : kind expensiveit doesn't break often , but when it , it tough repairit not too hard build , but it take whileit doesn't balance too well service tower/display stand because it so heavy . don't touch it though you'll finethe ten numb minifigure doesn't look too good my opinionyou open s-foils manually . you think lego would little gear-wheel open it . missiles zip range , but lego never really came through missile department anywayengines look bit tiny compared rest modelthe mechanic minifigure(whichever one you choose use , i like use ten numb minifigure)doesn't lot room stand onthe pilot minifigure kind hard fit inoverall , most flaws tiny it really cool ship worth $35	1
we enthusiastically played candy land each our three kids . it easily best starting point introducing child board games . players take turns drawing deck moving their pieces around board . cards one or two squares particular color ( such red , green , yellow , etc . ) players move pieces ahead path next matching spot same color . no counting or reading required . there also special cards move player ahead or behind , they indicated picture spot board which player should move their piece . play continues until one player reaches end . some my observations : 1 ) most kids probably start playing enjoying this game before recommended 36 months age . if you child attention span desire sit down 10-15 minute game , i'm pretty confident they could enjoy it . 2 ) among lessons our kids learned candyland : taking turns , recognizing colors , dealing disappointment . luckily , games quick enough it usually possible play multiple games one seting . this makes it possible keep playing until each child least one win . ( very helpful managing little egos)3 ) such simple game , it manages perfectly balance possibility changes fortune without seeming arbitrary . game literally doubt until last card played ( one " special " cards might send player back near start ) . this great teaching most valuable lessons : " never give up " . 4 ) most simple games , it almost impossible get older kids play after they reach certin age . we not found true candy land . we've games adult kids ages 3 , 6 , 9 playing together fun . if you more than one kid , you know how hard this . parent three , i give this game my highest recommendation	1
fabulous kitchen which i purchased my 2 year old grandaughter . i first saw it home recently sold me . i impressed quality appearance . upon speaking other parents discovering their children used this " toy " least until 9 , i inclined spend money . needless say , my grandaughter thrilled . i kitchen my home office both her mother i feel free use computer while she playing next us	1
i bought deluxe version this kitchen so there would plenty room my 2 3.5 year old use it same time . it big but it worth it ! it christmas present they play it daily . there plenty storage within kitchen play food pots/pans dishes although we use back up box overflow . it comes two big boxes but assembly fairly straight forward . it took me 1.5 hours power screwdriver ( i cannot imagine putting this together without one ) . few minor issues : description calls 14 aa batteries . it actually used 12 aa batteries phone used 2 aaa batteries . shipping very expensive . i wish i more homework either gotten lower price or free shipping . few screws difficult get place because there not enough room use power screwdriver ( or any screwdriver ) straight . screws battery plate phone very small one got stripped when trying take back plate off insert batteries . i not any problems other reviewers mentioned regarding doors not closing properly . everything fits tightly aligned well . overall i love style kitchen . it not garish like most play kitchens . everyone get kick out all appliances working light over sink . this toy that full details probably over my kids ' heads this time but appreciated more they get older . well worth money floor space ! but forget quiet moment read newspaper . my kids find best time cook something me	1

our son received this gift , we sent it back . box made inferior wood , very poorly constructed . not really " constructed " all - rather just glued together , not well , . two corners coming apart . also , lid opens two parts . drawback : when you open or close either side , plastic trays inside hold crayons pastels , fall out , there nothing securing them box . so , you try hold tray place while closing either side . we can't comment supplies themselves , we not allow our son try them , or else he would not able return item .	-1

i purchased wooden version this toy over plastic version because i thought wooden would more durable . i cannot speak plastic set , but wooden set certainly not made way it when i child . i bought this christmas present , month later many parts damaged . many ends rods cracked off . few rods broke when i playing my two daughters , so i know breakage occured during average gentle play . i very disapointed overall quality . this classic toy now produced overseas , not toy it once .	-1

when i first purchased this board , my expectations high , however what i met left me absolute disappointment . avid go players , this not board you . although if you real avid go player you would purchased 7000 dollar kaya board , however my budget doesn't allow it . this board workmanship quite well , no matter how you play it , go go , online , board , paper , etc . now heart matter , major problem this particular brand board , size . stones also poor , but you not expect top quality stones cheap this board . however , boards size , which incredibly small doesn't allow you use other brands stones if you've purchased them . so you stuck tiny board , terrible tiny plastic stones lighter than feather . playing experience isn't pleasant one false move scatter pieces everywhere you say goodbye game . my advice : not purchase this board unless you beginner unable get anything else , but even then i think beginner would greater experience playing paper , adequate ing stones . or perhaps play online . overall , this board terrible	1
" let make sentence " subject predicate color coded . my son matches colors doesn't read them make sentence . level 2 you make sentence it timed . he just hits colors .

imagine if you cat , would you ... 1 . ) nap all day 2 . ) bring your owner dead mice 3 . ) scaredy cat 4 . ) constantly cough up hairballs . you know what you would , but perhaps everyone else thinks differently you , unfortunately , majority rules . we loved this game . this game you write names board dry erase marker . each person rolls die they move around board landing certain names then reading " imaginiff " question person . names you all choose write board those people playing , people you all know who not there , or even famous people , it all up you . fact , aspect game makes game virtually brand new every time you play it . we many laughs finding out what we all thought each other . don't thin skin though because you might just leave bitter taste your mouth	1

unless you perfectly flat yard golf-course grade grass absolutely no twigs , leaves , pinecones , moisture , or variations ground level , this thing won't go . flat concrete it seems ok . yard , however , we forever pushing this thing around because it cannot go it own . wheels constantly spinning out . we bought it 3rd birthday gift my son . obviously , he would like ride it , but we hardly ever use it because my husband i hate walking behind him pushing ! we thought we purchased great thing after all reviews . we wanting him fun help us yard work hauling sticks/leaves/pinecones around . how wrong we . it fairly easy step-by-step assembly . we no breakage or charging problems , but we don't use it very often because major traction problem . it seem stay charged quite awhile even after long amounts time storage . we bought this after lot research . these people who think this thing so great must flat concrete yards . i never spent so much money so disappointed .	-1
my son received this gator christmas few years ago . it provided hours fun him his friends , but i am still disappointed ... 1 ) tires lousy traction - slip grass , snow dirt2 ) battery pain get out charging ... compartment way too small make this simple task ... it takes 5-10 minutes , if you put bar back too . 3 ) fragile !!! totally not durable ! windshield snapped clean off , one clips front grill where you need change battery also snapped off , reverse function broke we order new part my husband fix it ... once it fixed , week later gears totally stripped ! i pretty happy this toy until my friend got power wheels grave digger her son . battery pops out 2 seconds , charge indicator dash toy , runs awesome even wet grass , more pep than tractor 2 kids it . i'm shopping right now ride-on our son , i'm going stick power wheels this time	-1
doll looks very princely his arms bend , which great . helps my kids put his clothes .	1
my daughter really keen this doll eventually i relented bought it . it proven extremely disapppointing . expression face quite inane , it quickly relegated used bit patsy toy . character pegasus flawed , but he isn't stupid . i annoyed crown , he wasn't , after all prince - he may become one , but not during movie so why put crown his head ? my daughter really wanted ice skates him one key features this movie . none these characters come skates it seems , yet there huge ice skating scene start , least twice movie lovely double one end . i really like manufacturers tried make expressions smiling pleasant however i can't recall aiden doing it once movie . seems it designed independently movie without reference it looks . plus side , costume stuff all right used other dolls . it all seems very well sewn hardwearing	1
toy looked like it would made wood , but it made cheap plastic	-1
we buy lots melissa doug toys puzzles , but this one really pretty " cheesy " definitely not worth $$ . first one we received also defective/didn't work . i've seen much better versions so i would shop around	-1
i picked this up i hadn't played golden tee years , thought it worthwhile 35 bucks . i got it home , played it , enjoyed it few people , still enjoy it few people . however , you get very bored this , very fast . game , while graphics don't really deter me ... there not much differentiation power levels . also ... if you slice or hook ball , game allows you hit 475+ yard drives consistantly . may sound amazing , but it gets really boring when you finish round -24 . trackball very stiff , extremely easy gain full power . problem this game requires very little finess . it hit it hard you right club . there only one course , after you play it your buddies twice you bored it . it isn't real golden tee , but hey .. it 40 bucks . i've bought video games much more than less staying power . if you golden tee fanatic , you probably not enjoy this game . if you take it game away real golden tee , then you enjoy it . don't expect playing this every day , or spending hours hours mastering i t.t his game worth around , but it nothing spectacular	1
this really fun piece . bought it my 6 month old , but my 3 year old also playing it . plus it looks nice . stickers wheels ( you see picture ) came off but i glued them back . it seems like sturdy piece . i am happy this purchase would recommend it others	1
i bought 2 these cars my sister twin boys . they both around 4 years old you imagine very hard toys . i say they very excited this car . push button engine it makes several cool sounds even if you roll car forward it makes " revving " or " peeling out " sound . they really liked this . i little concerned roof opening accessing cockpit . it looked prone break i warn them both which completely ignored within hour both tops popped off . this actually designed very well very easy pop roof back . seems it made young destructive hands . overall car very sturdy , aesthetically pleasing great toy . only downside this car it not come batman figure . sad manufacture makes you go out find figure separately . anyway , i prepared this also bought them two batman exp figures which they could easily fit car . this car real hit kids receive lots rough play	1

i purchased this game my 12 year old son christmas . since he no siblings , i am usually his oppponent all games . this game challenging both us , used strategy well luck , moved quickly enough we stayed interested , easy start playing without read huge amount rules instructions . i think it helps math skills , too , but isn't so difficult younger players wouldn't enjoy it also . i also like how it stores all pieces into its plastic frame keep all game pieces together . it also some ideas how play solitare game if you can't find someone play . altogether great game	1
my son got this his first birthday loved it past 4 months . he learned very quickly how place balls top hit them hammer . he squeals while he watches balls roll through mirrored maze inside ... it very cute . only problem i it he figured out how stuff all sorts small toys into holes top , including his fisher price little people animals . they get into toy , but i take screwdriver open back get them out . i wish it unsnapped easier free trapped toys , but upside it very durable hard toddler destroy	1

i bought this gift someone else embarrassed how cheap it looked when we opened it . top it off , sand timer all glued or stuck together so only element game which you couldn't make yourself didn't even work . parts look like they're worth less than $0.25 boards pieces ridiculously cheap . they could've least put extra nickel or two into spinner , key element game . it , i think kindergartner could make this game their arts crafts hour . i'd recommend traditional word games like scrabble or boggle instead this .	-1
i purchased wordplay because i am always look out games educational dimension . my son ( aged 9 ) seems taken quite liking it , which great since he tends shy away anything he says `feels like school ' . he loves spinner middle game board ( nice touch ) , idea `spinning get your letters ' ( which then used form words ) . words themselves left child imagination vocabulary skills , ensuring game remains flexible interesting . even when he not playing some his friends , my son sometimes comes up me asks i spin him ( so he proudly show me words he formed using `my ' letters ) . all all , very smart . sometimes simplest ideas really best	1

concept , this great toy . design , however , it many flaws . backdrop piece just not stay attached ! ( i actually fun-tacked it wall behind where cloud kingdom sits my daughter playroom . ) clouds pieces , while very pretty , just not solid enough hold up . sure make plenty space this toy because it takes up 3 feet room not fold away storage . my 4-year-old not seem mind any this , though . it really inspire her imaginative play she flies her pegasi through sky	-1
see solve visual calculator really useful helping young ones who just learning their math skills . actually see problem screen very productive understanding what child doing . i , grandmom , hard time pushing numbers , but may just me , because my grandson no problem all . i would recommend this gift or aid help math	1

after looking stores , catalogs online we decided order this table our two year old son . even though price bit more than i felt we needed spend it worth it . quality great legs thick sturdy our son loves it ! course he loved helping me attach legs which simple after we comvinced him turn it over he delighted belly up his colors books . we feel this great quality piece easily incoporated into his room bedside table or end table after he out grows its current purpose	1
this tent works great out home . great fortress within home , or get baby off grass sand outside . it takes up some square feet , but if you room , it fun play . assembly time probably 5-10 mins one person . more use , i'm sure it assembled faster pace . one side stays open , but masked sheet or blanket ( if you would like your baby stay inside ) . my 9 month baby i easily fit within tent , much room grow . easy disassembly . this tent job getting baby out sun , great place naps when out . this low price , nothing compares . stows away neatly easily small bag ( approx 4x12 inches ) .	1
this projector just what everyone above saying ... useless ... not go buy it !! i give it " 0 " stars . negatives very hard make out . i couldn't tell if i looking earth or venus	-1
we received this gift . it worthless . there little or no 3-d effect . slides little interest	1

this happens one my favorite toys ( i collect toys ) . it socute it outragous-whenever i see it , i can't help but smile . i keepdarth tater up top my left audio speaker tower , he one thefirst things you see when entering my living room . this great toy concept , those us who never forgottenour potato head days , this bring them back smile . very easy put together , but i would not buy it small child , asthere some smallish plastic parts they might swallow = very definitely toy us scifi/emorabilia lovers . honey , i remember when first tater heads came out , you stickthe plastic parts into real potato ! so this all-plastic version avery pleasant update . this would make great office toy ...... i give this five smilies up !!! : -	1
my husband received this gag present , my 3 year old daughter loves it . it far her favorite her mr. potato head collection , spudtrooper . i'm not sure if it lightsaber or cape , but something this toy captivates her . if you're mr. potato head fan , whether young or old , this must . we're looking forward adding artoo-potatoo family when he available also . :	1
my almost 5 year old son loves driving his jeep all over neighborhood . because better handling wheel design ( not slanted ) , jeep remarkably agile . what my kid so far : - taken jeep off road bike trails- drive through iced dirt- drive through 1/2 " mud- drive through 1/4 " water puddles- pull passengers tied wagon ( we almost died laughing)i agree previous reviewer car bit big sub 3 year old , but my younger one ( 2.5 ) loves passenger .	1
this great older kids adults . too powerful little ones	1
we planned getting one these houses our daughters 6 3 share but toys us them b1g1 october so they each got one christmas . i am amazed detail put into these houses . they look great really durable . we bought 6 rooms worth furniture there still least dozen more playsets they get go it . girls love it it really gives them chance use their imagination	1
i surprised how enchanted my daughter this house because she hard buy . most toys i think she love sit collecting dust . she four years old i chose buy her doll house xmas this year because i remember loving my doll house so much when i her age . i also owned fisher price doll house , so i wasn't turned off all plastic . i admit i disappointed how cheaply made house seemed when we pulled it out box , but after two weeks ( her twin baby sisters getting into it every chance they get ) it holding up well . yes , twin time doll house right up our ally ! i love how it mimics our real life family so well ( exception hair color , twin boy , pink decor ) . i especially like furniture sets , they attractive , interesting play , seem well made . it drag everything bought separately . more corporate greed i assume . house should least include kitchen , bathroom , bedroom , family room . rest rooms could optional . what up silly little kitchen sink cheapo furniture comes it ? least decency lower cost additional ten bucks house empty . exception baby cribs , these items not get played once " nice " furniture arrives . i bought her doll house walmart , so it came big sister her bedroom set , which nice addition . family members bought her kitchen , bathroom , laundry room , family room , dinning room . i think it would nice parents bedroom , too . house certainly too small accommodate all furniture sets . i would prefer house doesn't fold but larger rooms . i question how well this house would hold up if it constantly folded up . my other recommendation fisher price add stair case . my doll house winding black stair case definitely fun feature . overall i like house , but i think it could use some tweaking .	1
i am so glad i got this gift my husband . we our friends played this game over over again . i just love it . rules sometimes not specific but we just make house rules cover any questions . we enjoy it so much we wish it larger so more than 4 people could play . great buy !	1
this game highest quality we quite pleased every aspect it . wooden dice , pewter ships , velvet treasure bags , cloth map , plastic gems hefty metal doubloons ... everything just so " neat " . we all enjoyed checking out details it all . far gameplay goes , i don't understand why some people would problem dice rolls . one aspect game play we truly enjoy . it exciting try outroll your fellow players , if you're lucky enough dread pirate you get add +1 your roll , it brings some educational value game . part game we found both educational fun cards come into play when you land certain spaces map . cards directions you follow , they also tidbits historical facts them . our entire family loves this game , it enjoyable all ages , our 5 year old all way up us 36 year olds . it very easy learn play , even younger children . there basic game rules there also advanced rules older crowd who've gotten used gameplay first few times around . i highly recommend this game those who looking family games both educational entertaining . i also recommend it those who fans all things pirate .	1
we bought this croc our son ( 5 ) who loves anything hot wheels found most cars don't work this . also , sounds annoying point my son wanting it stop .. which very rare . half time crocs mouth won't drop shut , i agree one other reviews saying it nearly impossible get car boat . we tried tried got it there once . most time car never even made it boat because it flipped over after dropping crocs mouth . amazon correct charging only $5 this toy , it not worth any more than .	1
this set great age range , it various activities different physical levels . we know we'll get several years ' use out it . it really difficult put together , but feels very sturdy well-made regardless	1
good toy . soft , cuddly , well made . my kids love webkinz website . they very happy cocker spaniel toy	1

even though webkinz toy website fun my daughter , we lost tag tried contacting customer service two months !!! no response emailing through our email , their website or calling . why they say you 14 years or older call , if o-o ne answering calls anyway !!! i don't plan buy , or suggest anyone else buy one either , until they improve their customer service . what kick face !!!	-1
this set certainly used toy kids . however , its real purpose more decorative than functional . it designed display hardcore halloween horror fans . regard , it outstanding . michael myers looks just i'd picture him first two movies . however , i am really impressed what they dr. loomis . loomis sort guy who , if you don't get likeness right , easily come out looking like lenin . figure looks good something this size range look . other features quite good , well . steps surroundings attractive . ( they screw you out shrubs pictured box , however . ) overall , i thought this beautifully . effect quite authentic . everything looks just one would hope . i hope they eventually create more these , commemorate later films , well . ( i personally would pay heavily see loomis released featuring his 2by4 part 5 . ) if they make one , they'll hard time topping this one	1

my son who absolutely loves all sports cannot get enough hoop challenge ! two balls , pump over door hoop complete separate led scoring even crowd noises what not love ? he play himself practice his free throws " three pointers " or he challenge his dad or me or even his sister game one one . coolest thing this hoop actually recognizes which ball goes scores accordingly ! balls color coded : white black . only reason i gave this only 4 stars it doesn't always score correctly it score if anything breaks sensor rim , like your hand . scores only go up one point instead two . also , crowd noises get bit much ; what would really improve this if you could dual switch where you crowd noises or off , but you listen them if you want use scoring system . but this one coolest most often used toys our house loved many many years come	1
pretty pretty princess cinderella edition game one our five year old daughter favorite games . we fun gluing stickers trying match our jewelry set . wear jewelry adds fun . it easy game learn play . her grandmother enjoyed playing this game even glued sparkling craft pieces bottom jewelry box , much delight our little princess . previous reviewer mentioned game not ' educational ' . while i , too , like educational games , i don't think every game educational . sharing time play together rewarding itself . pretty pretty princess game simply sweet little girl game , one all three generations fun playing .	1
my 5 year old got this present liked it . however , her 3 year old little sister plays it enjoys it more . it seem little too simple older ones but it entertaining . also , it tend get little boring you continue play since it seems take some time finally win . actually we never played it till someone wins because they seem grow tired it before happens . all all , this good board game it fun play ... just maybe not till end	1
this wood version game wonderfully durable . it looks attractive when playing when shelf . it classic aged look	1
even though this puzzle intended children , it use . my blind mother wished she could remember placement all states . she said " if only they made puzzle-like product all states which would talk when you pressed each state . " i searched searched through all catalogs products made visually impared people found nothing . then friend showed me melissa doug usa map sound puzzle she bought child . wow ! this exactly what i looking . my mom found puzzle easy use spent hours it . voice loud clear . so far , she able remove each piece , listen information , replace it without getting " lost " . only negatives this kind use intended use take all pieces out , then put them back one-by-one . blind person , you take each piece out separately put it back before taking next piece out . getting inland state out bit difficult . also , some smaller states grouped into one piece , so blind person only tell states grouped , but can't tell how they relate geographically each other . its intended use child puzzle , it would work fine . just make sure your child over age where he or she would try swallow piece . they small choking hazard	1
it fun ! colour awesome . so many new things , i never bored again	1
i looked every where this ! then i found it toysrus online but they dont it they ran out . man i wish i could one	1

i worried my 15 month-old young start playing legos , but she proved me wrong . she loves them play even alone . these little bit smaller than first set we got , but still bigger than their regular size older kids . i would recommend this toy everyone small children : it improves their motorical skills coordination	1

if you've mastered 3x3 cube looking challenge , go 4x4 . we all know , competitive cubing almost exclusively 3x3 ... however , if you want bone up your cubing skills this great training cube . there so many more combinations permutations cube coloring 4x4 design ... think it , there 96 sub-cubes this version vs . 54 original 3x3 cube . like many other rubik products , this cube not flawless . stickers peel easy there bit squeak twist action . i wouldn't use competition , but like i said 4x4s rarely used competition . buy training aid	1
i love rubik cube i myself solve regular rubik cube but not big one problem though stickers they peel off second day you use it they need go back way they it eighty paint way i don'y buy new one every time sticker falls	1
this super well-constructed toy , simple straightforward . my son really likes it . before he ready put shapes their individual holes , he would just dump them out put them back top . his hand fits fine into top hole . it little weighty , but that not bad thing , especially since recent studies shown kids who play weighted toys better muscle tone . i'm knocking off star because , previous reviewer mentioned , vertical slots trickier use than slanted ones	1
guy i work really r/c planes his enthusiasm finally spilled over me . i recently bought this dominator just because i wanted " wing " dual motors ... so i went wally world plunked down $30.00 this thing . first , plane sharp right turn cartwheeled blacktop our parking lot ! surprisingly , there only few scuffs ... my buddy bent rudders little we tried it again it flew pretty straight he got it up least 200 ' air it pretty awesome ! i then flew it few times no crashes , but it kind hard control .... you need lot space fun this thing . something remember : absolutely double charge batteries every time ! my flight times around 5-7 minutes each time . i've learned get it way up air soon possible then only few touches left or right .... it glides pretty nice cheap little plane . it look cool air i like sound motors when turning ... i'd recommend it , but only fly it someone experienced them first ..... overall , i'd buy it again !... oh , use clear packing tape leading edges wings ! trust me , it makes difference ...	1
these creature peepers wonderful !! our 4-year-old just loves his ! before we this , he always bringing his newly-found " friends " into house . yuck !! since buying creature peeper , he still brings his 6 8-legged " friends " into house- but now i am much calmer it ! he loves catch all sorts bugs study them through magnifying scopes top bottom this toy . great fun curious children !	1
my 5 year old sleeps this weekends . it very durable . we've it long time . ones who said it won't go up or collapses easily ... you didn't assemble it correctly . it folds up nicely under bed it expands so well it bit difficult move through hallway . luckily it bendable . i don't know playing it though . it kind small unless it 2 year old or younger . our son only sleeps it	1
tent too flimsy . it can't support itself , it light feather it gets pushed all aover place my kids . they don't even play it anymore ' cause they over it	-1
before i talk toy , everyone please note you must also purchase tyco pro flexpack battery pack . i'm sure it just oversight part amazon toys us . however , ad shell shocker only states toy requires 2 aa batteries . so wrong . ad also shows people who purchased shell shocker also purchased tmh flexpak battery pack charger . i followed , but mislead . top it all off , because we opened package , we charged shipping return it . wait ! there more . when you search amazon correct battery pack , you redirected bananatoys.com (...) toys us worked it out us though . our local toys us store battery pack in-stock (...) , allowed us return incorrect product store , they credited cost wrong battery shipping charges . thank you toys us . toy . it amazing . we bought shell shocker our grandson seventh birthday . he absolutely loves it ! i'm sure who more fun it -- him , his dad , or his grandfather . watch tail -- it inflict pain . but if you're aware careful , it just blast play watch	1

twin 4 year old girls , i vast experience little houses , castles , etc ... this toy far exceeds most them out there , including many disney products barbie castles . pieces small , yet manageable sturdy . there enough " tricks " ( working light , mailbox , etc .. ) keep it interesting , yet not so many it too much preschooler . miniature little ponies adorable fun play . i impressed product considering affordable price ($22 it came extra free pony ) . i paid $20 already barbie castle only comes tiny thin miniature plastic pieces ( always get lost ) thin , cheap plastic structures nothing ( no lights , etc .. ) this product well worth it	1
i bought this after reading reviews positive this little gym . 3 months age he enjoy kicking gym getting music started . my sister-in-law says while yes it loud , it isn't anything seems bothersome my nephew . it gets his attention keeps it .... little while least	1
my son likes playing this toy now he sit up green bench play buttons . when he younger not able sit , we would put him under it him kick bench . when he able kick it hard enough make it play music , toy would move across room because there no traction bottom it prevent it moving . this great toy when kids able actually play , but not good toy use kicker .	1

parachute play , we campers ranging two years old over 60 , everyone able participate- together . little ones ran under billowing , bright nylon . they played giant beach ball under covering like they their own live forthouse , then we put ball top see how many consecutive times we could cooperatively toss it parachute center , then catch it send it aloft again . game possibilities endless . ten sturdy , comfortable web handles all around edges made it manageable big little hands alike . parachute packs up small light its accompanying nylon bag , so we could use it filler play 5 minutes activities , take it beach anytime warm up water , even tote it our hike use instant shade when draped over piece string strung two trees ! every family taking road trip should one these standard travel gear soft frisbee kickball . one unexpected benefit : this perfect solution if you're looking colorful , lively photo op advertise camp , children program , cooperation seminar , or just capture memory make your heart smile	1

this toy seems unfinished cheaply made . i got it $15 toys us i certainly wouldn't pay more it . it small , doesn't on/off switch , characters barely look like themselves . it definitely doesn't look like it last long , just not well made . but ... my 15 month old daughter loves it . my 3 6 year old boys got bored it really quick but it keep my daughter interest . she loves wiggles . characters pop up down when you play they keyboard it easy little guys play it . i hate toys marketed little kids it too hard them manipulate it make it work . music quality isn't too bad it two different volumes . not annoying adults . music only plays couple seconds time . not bad toy but they could so much better .	1
our son loves this toy . details accurate , size ideal small child , because very study design , it practically indestructible ! i only wish playmobil made more models . ( yes , there many small parts we added back he grown into toy- also great point- it sophisticated enough last more than 6-8 months	1

this truly great game underscores adage quot ; keep it simple , stupidquot ; ! all ages play ... even my 2 year old pull out stick see if made marble fall . i only one complaint ... quality physical aspect game . course i kerplunk kid tube tray amp ; sticks much heavier plastic . this kerplunk you must hold tube pull stick out or whole shebang fall over . maybe original classic version produced . i noticed this same skimping other great games such quot ; troublequot ; quot;don't break icequot ; etc ... i would pay few more dollars better quality but suggest you buy it quot ; isquot ; anyway	1

tried buckets dinosaurs ? this great addition box ( plus they make smaller unmoving version which great offspring ) .	1
o my gosh ! its best game ever ! game you just daring enough bid your money ... it really cool game price	1
i don't think this toy could made any cheaper . ours cracked several places , even though it hardly played ... my kids really not hard toys , destroying this one . we also bought drumset little tikes , but returned it , because it broke before i could even assemble it . disappointing . this keyboard just doesn't live up my expectations little tikes products	-1
this given my 3 year old daughter her sister christmas . microphone broke putting it together . i couldn't find reciept so customer service made me pay 5.00 send new one which took 8 weeks !! customer service not through little tikes which explains poor service we got , not mention customer serv . rep . accussed me it months just wanting get new microphone . stand useless if you move it bottom comes apart over over over !!! however , my little girl love keyboard all differrent melodies flashing lights etc .. she loves singing i like it makes her happy until base comes apart bottom . it carry handle ( used out base ) but it bit bulky little hands carry around . i say company needs improve stand/base this product .	1
this well made price works well temporary use , particularly since it folds stores nicely under bed if necessary . my granddaughter happily played ate table able entertain playmate extra chair . just note , require some assembly	1
i purchased this camera my two grandchildren . i truly disappointed product , i think kids too ; they showed no real interest using it or playing immediate .	-1

i searched really long time other night see if quantum books work leap pad pro systems . i never found answer . i almost ordered quantum my 9-year-old granddaughter but decided wait . discount store i saw books , it clearly states book it work all leap pad systems except my first leap pad . what relief . saved me $40	1
little boys love this toy . they all want sanitation workers once they get playing it	1
dizzy really cool toy . her cement " dumps " out , but stays attached ( no small part worry ) . front " head " bends so she stand like show when saying " brilliant " . her front wheels move slightly like show . rear magnet used lot lofty lifts dizzy out cement ( like one books ) . held up 2 months bathtub hard play . these take alongs so much better than talkies just right size children	1
i recommend all little tikes " rugged rigz " vehicles . they large , sturdy work well . little tikes bulldozer one best , though , my son favorite . it tracked bulldozer/loader , blade raises lowers ( blade locks three different levels " flips up " unload sand/toys it scooped up ) . tractor makes series diesel engine/backing sounds when your child pushes large red button top . these sounds continue intermittently long child pushes toy around , but unlike some toys , sound not start until they press button . your little construction engineer love this toy	1
i bought this my 17 month old son because he loves water things spin . i looked few sand water tables settled this one because spinning accessories ( they all seemed pretty similar otherwise ) comprably , price pretty good , too . i must say , we really pleased this purchase . not only my son love it , but i found it very well made . its really easy put together ( no tools needed ! ) but still nice sturdy . it also lightweight easy store . entire table breaks down compact storage . table two deep sections ( so far we've used both water- maybe we'll sand future ) its nice height toddlers , it comes some really cute accessories . scoops perfect little hands accesories sturdy , too . they withstood some abuse my son . it sectional lid , so you could one side covered while leaving other open , or cover both . lid fits nicely little road design top , so when not used messy stuff , it could also serve play surface . overall , i'm very pleased . i think its well worth price . its not cheap , sure ( considering its just molded plastic ) but i learned pretty quickly kids stuff just expensive- even junk- so i guess my expectations low ;) . we try not overindulge our son ' stuff ' , but felt toy like this would serve multi-educational purpose , so we splurged . pleased say we weren't disappointed .	1

my 3 year old spent total 7 minutes playing this book before she asked put different book into her leap pad . when i encourage her use pooh again , she absolutely refuses . she loves her pooh characters loves her leap pad . but this book ? it never touched again . it seems simple , 3 year olds need challenge	1
i pay lot money ( more than purchase price ) this item expedited . it didn't show up time . however , company made good returning few shipping dollars , product what it , without " themes " you purchase stores . experience -- other than delay -- fine	1
we bought this our daughter christmas . she loves polly pockets . i liked it because it came guy animals . it even little seatbelts . top comes off you rock animals . doors click shut . you make sure seatbelt out way or it won't click . it great polly pocket addition our collection	1
this great game ! it lot fun , not just trivia like trivial pursuit . there word puzzles , analogies , wild cards could anything - 3 questions where you fill two blanks , guessing someone name , etc . it really great game , though probably better suited older age bracket , we tried play 11-year old , there just some words musical groups she didn't ( couldn't possibly expected ) know .	1
thing i like this game it trivia game everyone play . my hubbie hates trivial pursuit , but likes wit end , because , since lot it multiple choice , you chance getting answer even if you just guess	1
after reading all glowing reviews , i really excited this game . i very disappointed when i finally got game actually played it my family , however . there four categories question , but these categories differ how question asked , not subject question . it nice idea , different subject matter might make game interesting . majority questions seem involve history or dates one way or , however . if question music or film , example , it might involve placing placing releases order oldest most recent . current events questions might require player know which event occurred before certain date . someone who more interested why what than when , i found myself bored frustrated this game . i like learn something even when i get question wrong , but i found myself not caring much right answer question if all it involved knowing which obscure play written before wwii , etc . conclusion : if you're good history dates , you'll probably enjoy this game . otherwise you'll probably bored anxious game end .	1
this tracing type art toy nearly impossible use . reflective panels not securely attach if you just brush them your arm they fall down . there no integrated light toy so you need find very well lit space work . my 5 year old i extremely frustrated this toy returning it	-1
i just got this figure mail i say it really nice looking . i it up my mantle now it looks = even better out it packaging . it must kings , gretzky , nhl fans . id rate pose 10 out 10 , it when he got points record edmonton . this figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't assembly . you put wayne legs normally leg assembly easy but thios just horrific . it possible , but i use tons soap water just get legs , then it wasn't easy . but i think it definately worth it .	1
i love this little cottage . we got it my 18 month old she enjoys it everyday !! i love it more open than other pretend houses , so there plenty air circulation our hot humid weather while she playing . construction very durable , there enough space her friend , or doll play ! definitely don't think twice . free shipping bargain this !	1
we just gave this playhouse our daughter her second birthday , she absolutely loves it . if she spots it out window she starts crying go out play it , even when it bedtime . i love how i watch her playing afar , because how sides open , but she still two windows she open close . i also love how it solid floor . other playhouses i've seen , without floors , end up dead grass mud them . house roomy enough inside i join her there , she loves phone . even though she few different play phones play , i think she likes this one best because it most realistic . doorbell sounds so realistic , too . i researched lot different playhouses , different price ranges , i feel you truly get most your money this house . i'm not giving 5 stars because it wasn't completely easy my husband assemble . he said there some parts where instructions said drill straight , but really he drill angle make it secure . also , there some defective assembly parts , like screw flat , instead pointed , tip . house itself somewhat flimsy . when my daughter leans onto table it bend down some . but , so far it holding up , this price i really can't complain . just warning other parents ... when we tried buying this house stores early july it already deemed " out season " , we left either buy it online ( pay nearly $100 shipping ) , or travel hour away where we find one store . i learned my lesson always buy outdoor toys spring or early summer .	1
bought one because i liked idea light show ceiling . first one stopped turning first night lullaby music button didn't work like others wrote . returned it same thing !!! i say i like idea but this far most disappointing mobile we bought	-1
i would like ask others who purchased this mobile if they hear " buzzing " sound mobile rotates . it seems loud me i'm wondering if this normal or if i purchased defective one . also , i feel music too loud even lower volume selection . i even covered speaker muffle it it primary purpose put baby sleep not keep him/her awake .	1
i got this my little girl her second christmas . she played it christmas day once her room . balls hard her put hole top . she just started placing them slide ( not through top ) . she never used panio keys could not turn wheel . not much fun	1
my 5 year old 19 month old love this toy . it cute music learning stuff it , very colorful . it worth it	1
my 6 yr old son got this christmas present . it disgusting !! stuff sticky oozes out when it setting . it isn't very tasty either . my son liked gummies but there some kind drink we poured down drain . i put it up am hoping he forgets we it !! recipes not hard follow but pouring them into molds getting everything set up requires adult .	1
kids fun this , but goo very hard young kids mix without making mess . it starts set very quickly so its hard get enough out bowl into molds . it okay , but definately not worth $25 . my 6 year old just much fun playing cheap spices bowl water	1
mcfarlane toys only up series 3 cooperstown collection 6-inch action figures some baseball greatest stars yesterday , nolan ryan already up his second edition . his first figure part series 1 , showed him home uniform texas rangers , his left knee up his chest he got ready throw pitch ( presumably fastball high 90s ) . this figure shows all-time strikeout king road uniform california angels , following through pitch ( presumably fastball low 100s ) . so two figures you would long ( or tall ) short nolan ryan . ryan traded angels new york mets jim fregosi pitched eight seasons california , 1972 1979 . however , this figure would represent ryan 1975 or later because when angels started wearing red cleats you see this figure . too bad , because his best seasons angels 1973 , when he went 21-16 single-season record 383 strikeouts 2.87 era , 1974 , when he 22-16 , 367 strikeouts 2.89 era . he threw first two no-hitters 1973 his third 1974 , those also only two seasons ryan won over 20 games , which amazing when you consider he ends up over 300 wins . course , becomes easier when you pitch 27 seasons all i say whoever taught young pitchers mets farm system how strengthen their legs prolong their career fantastic job ryan ( 27 seasons age 46 ) , tom seaver ( 22 seasons age 41 ) jerry koosman ( 19 seasons age 42 ) . seaver or somebody must passed this information roger clemens . only reason ryan retired because age 46 he his first season ten years when he not average over strikeout inning . sculpt ryan face pretty good always attention details uniform great . figure limited articulation , but basically you want it look like what you see here . me key detail how relaxed ryan right hand looks now he released ball , like he just whipped ball somebody one his 5,714 strikeouts . he threw seven no-hitters ( this could not his 1974 no-hitter because he pitched home against baltimore orioles not road ) , 12 one-hitters . what new record ryan express i learn today ? he only pitcher strike out side nine pitches both leagues , not this surprises anyone . but you look his record you wonder what he would if he played better teams , because he career era 3.19 go all those strikeouts . nolan ryan last quarter 20th century what walter johnson first quarter : great pitcher despite teams not great . why he popular enough already his second cooperstown collection figure .	1
awful game . nothing like show . only way we could try make it work both teams answer each round just see who scored most points . they must pay people write some those 5 star reviews . i doubt my family ever play this game again . boring	-1
i am sure this must good program , however , i disappointed find it not pc program rather one tv . i am hoping i trade it pc program since my granddaughter i like play family feud when she visits . we older version but we wanted updated version	1

if there option pick " no stars " this item i would ! this got worst organizer made . top serving no purpose , toys us manufacturer not willing work me exchanging it something functional ! bins sit 2 wooden poles per rack . there no center support each rack therefore when you load bins ; they fall down onto rack below so . it very frustrating it only sits my son room collect dust until i throw it out this weekend ! i highly recommend avoiding this organizer manufacturer ! what waste money energy !	-1

this main thing my daughter wanted xmas . three months later i finally gathered everything up grocery bag took it back store because it just sat collecting dust . main reason we couldn't get it open . it took 2 days set date . then i figured since i could it would ok close it until we could work it some more . we tried tried use password but no luck . honestly i think they need take thing off market . it nice concept . i ended up getting her barbie dairy instead . much less stress much cheaper . i know there plenty people out there agree me i only wish i would listened you before i bought it .	-1

we this magnetic abc book year now . we take it out look together every few weeks or so . pieces all intact book fairly entertaining . my 2-year-old likes take all pieces out , one one , then he name pictures he puts them back correct positions . my opinion , illustrations just ok , but then , that not really point this product . my 2-year-old book fanatic sit " read " his books 45 minutes time , several times week . this not one his favorites , but every so often , he seems enjoy it . it something different anyway . i like " hands-on " approach this book provides . this would make great car or plane trip toy , provided you bring carry case all pieces . this quiet , educational , somewhat engaging requires no batteries	1

over years , i managed amass collection pretty much every version " password " ever produced . exception " super password , " i enjoyed every televised version show . " password " episode " odd couple " one my all time tv favorites . you may guessed , i like game . this dvd version , all intent purpose , just over-produced variation standard home version . instead cards holders , you get pair 3-d looking glasses . unfortunately , you easily read secret password screen without glasses . , computer generated host ( charmin ' chuck harmin ) just annoying host they could come up . endless games produced many good home games . dvd games , least going this one , not fit into their business model quite well . save yourself some money get their standard edition " password " game . it not high-tech . but it lot more fun	1
my son received this car his first birthday . time he not fine motor skills needed use keys etc fix car , but he loves push it floor watch it go crash when it bumped into things . it kept him busy kitchen evenings while i cooked . now it coming closer two year mile marker , he learning use keys refuel engine fix problems car when it breaks down . it just challenging enough him fun , it also dishes out rewards when he gets it righ t.t his toy very durable planning went into it fantastic . it just enough sounds keep him entertained but not annoying ! a+ our house	1

my baby girl absolutely loved this toy ! we gave it her when she 4 1/2 months old she immediately figured out spinner pull-hammer . my only complaint would now she too old beginner side but gets frustrated advanced side . but on/off switch big plus age all toys lights sounds it hooks onto siderail crib or sits her legs very easily	1
we've received this toy gift our friends i liked idea 2 sides ( like 2 new toys once ) . but then , when we tried playing it i didn't like several things : 1 ) side 1 - really hard squeak thing , - hard pull hammer - pretty far located smiley face so baby playing it activity table ( not crib mounted ) won't easily reach press it- smiley face could more than 1 melody playingit results side only 3 things play baby 6-8 months : spinning flower , spinning ball mirror2 ) side 2- most i don't like this toy ( both sides ) music those 4 musical instruments buttons . it sounds not like it baby toy but like it some kind tool horrify baby . we pretty much musical toys none them music which soooo unpleasant . my baby just looks tose buttons she looks strangers she doesn't like . - pop-up thing - could better holding door ( opens easily ) prettier " animal " inside . - squeaky knob this side hard push even me . summarize i'll just say me even 2 sides not worth money ! i don't like it all	1

its great because you study it figure out how it works , whose lightsaber it movies ( this case its qui-gon jinn blue ) fight it because its durable , all sorts stuff !! i love it !	1
i bought lightsaber like this one right before realease episode 3 . i also bought electronic color changing one which i thought would way cooler then basic lightsaber . putting it quite frankly i terribly mistaken . sure electronic lightsaber sounds changes color but u cant even see it daylight . plus basic lightsaber half cost electronic lightsaber . my friends i play woods every day our lightsabers . tell u truth i traded lightsaber changes color yugioh cards . only bad thing it not very educational . it however quite entertaining . i think worst thing if you drop lightsaber handle probaly get scratched or if u use them regularly blade may dented . overall very good i suggest u buy more wait until they make better electronic ones	1

we bought this christmas gift our son . what colossal waste money . he so dissappointed it so hard use ( even adult help ) . my husband re-solder wire connections before we could even use it once . we would better off buy strong magnifying glass prepared slides looking slides way . actually finding focusing slide image almost impossible due cheapness this product . it his " big " present turned out dud . we'd return it , but would blow santa cover	1
girls love all versions bratz . mom , i think bratz dolls look too mature their presumed ages . makeup way over top their clothing only compare " ladies night " . babyz underware only described thongs . however , finally kidz version improved upon . makeup still strong , but more acceptable . clothing closer what kid would wear overall look more innocent than other bratz dolls . if you've also found bratz dolls objectionable ( even though i still buy them ) , kidz version much more acceptable my 7 y.o. daughter seems like these better than any other version .	1
when i went into toys us today merely check new barbie clothes my pullip dolls , i no intention buying this lovely girl . i skimmed through bratz section just see what there . my companion pointed out yasmin kidz doll , i thought she very cute , but not my cup o ' tea . i searched cloe since she my favourite- * points cloe army * -and found her . i promptly fell love . her hair very pretty , it reminds me sun-kissed cloe hair , minus braids . her face very cute , i like her body proportions . clothes well made , she perfect size carrying around . i cannot recommend her enough ! if you like cloe , you should defidentely get this girl . -taff	1
i bought this set because my 5-year-old son begging thomas train set i cannot afford those prices ! so i took chance this one , i am thrilled ! roundhouse very high quality , almost identical thomas train one which sells $80 . set comes lots good quality wooden track ( no splinters or sharp edges , it all fits together fine ) , two bridges , turntable , two cranes easy operate , two trains , truck , two people , trees , signs . best all , you build exact display shown box still leftover track ! no disappointment ! my only complaint one little trains came it keeps losing wheel . not such big deal us , because we bought thomas train engines use instead ( yes , they fit track just fine ) . this set supposed compatible brio trains too , but we haven't tried those yet .	1
i bought this monopoly my husband , who loves video games . he adores it ! pieces spaces absolutely perfect any gamer	1
two classic games/companies brought together .. you can't go wrong . if you like monopoly nintendo , this seems like obvious pairing . cards cute clever . any monopoly game , it always seems games take forever , we still haven't gotten through full game . but i think key playing 4 or more order make it go more quickly .	1
this best toy box . it holds huge amount toys , my 18 month old no problems opening or closing it . it only took 20-30 minutes put together . i would definitly recommend it .	1
looking nice sturdy , wooden toy chest replace overflowing toy basket this perfect . quality wood great , design nice simple , assembly wasn't bad all . it took hour myself while hubby doing other things . size perfect our house safety latch nice security measure . my 3 year old loves rummage thru it her toys mommy loves fact toys aren't cluttered everywhere . i highly recommend it	1
we love this toy . we bought it cheer up my son who broke his arm , it certainly worked . $3.50 , we still laughing days later . it writes ! my kids writing their christmas cards this pen even my 3 yr old loves it . perfect stocking stuffer . kids all ages . :	1
i really expected more this product when reading description . within 15 minutes use , antennae fell off one . upon examining it , i discovered it decorative purposes only no useful purpose . we also hard time getting it function properly . my granddaughter , who loves stuff like this , rarely plays it . she wanted real walkie-talkie this one performs like " pretend " one .	1
i resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " my son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able independently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1
my family enjoyed pirates movies so much we couldnt wait get this game . once we started playing it we very disappointed . it no excitement it . we thought it would clips movies but but it doesnt . it just moving ships around map collecting cards your treasure . it takes long time each turn since you put your coordinates your ship see if you found any treasure . we played it 2 hours still no where near ending game . prepared long game if you buy this product	1
first , i just love little people toys !! fisher price made great beginner dollhouse this toy ! my daughter received it her first birthday . she loves move people enjoys making sounds house . she still plays it occasionally 18 months . i definitely think this 1st dollhouse - it doesn't many pieces there aren't many rooms . this great 1-year old , but i purchased " my first dollhouse " my daughter christmas step up . so , if you're looking longevity , i'd look into other dollhouses fp makes . but , younger children , i'm sure you won't dissapointed this one	1
i originally bought urban myth over holidays , struck what promising concept game it promised . how wrong i . starters box deceiving ; age recommendation 12 over which couldn't further truth . this definitely not family game . box , cutesy picture tame questions posed back misleading say least . least 85% questions our first go fairly high morbidity/death factor ( including one wince-inducing question weather or not infant carcasses used mob drug cartel . mercifully , it myth . ) i'm no prude , would no problem topics game not made promises whole family could play . now i'll certainly investigate content before inviting kids come join us . , err- how i put this ? shape game pieces ... interesting . course , i noticed this right away but just chalked it up my dirty , dirty mind . but soon kids left room moment , somewhat conservative mother leaned into me whispered " it just me , or those game pieces look like male _________ ? " so , yeah , this game gets big thumbs down family friendly departmen t.t hat aside , i'm afraid i cannot recommend game adult players well . urban myth also fails board game ... far we could ascertain board only served one particular purpose fairly feeble one . ( goal actually collecting enough letter cards either spell ' truth ' or ' myth ' . ) otherwise , you just mindlessly navigate board until someone collects enough cards based solely questions . board almost entirely useless . finally , game worst crime missed educational opportunity . when you play trivial pursuit get true or false question , give you correct answer some additional information said answer back card . this game only dryly indicates tale ' truth ' or ' myth ' without any further information , like why it myth or why it truth or how it all got started urban legend begin . if there no facts back up either claim , then why should we believe answers ? i know there only so much space back game card , but some information would nice . what waste . hopefully someone out there take this great idea turn it into great game i know it could . common boardgame idea guys ! better . try harder .	1
bright colors little knobs perfect beginner puzzle solvers . price great deal too	1
my daughter got few these melissa doug peg puzzles christmas , she now 16 months old mastered all them now so i keep buying new ones , i love she loves sit down them , it so wonderful sit help her watch her learn ! i think these wonderful ! she gets so excited play her puzzles	1
my twin 2 year olds borrowed this puzzle library loved it . we borrowed many lights camera interaction puzzles possible . it helped hand-eye coordination , well image recognition . my only problem trying remove ink puzzle . we accidentally ruined puzzle during cleaning , but this companies customer service huge help took care our replacement needs . i can't say enough great things this company or its products	1
these lot fun , i bought them my pool , even pool people love them . i put them pool when friends come swim . only down side theny tend end up skimmer batteries wear out pretty fast . i would recommend them adults or kid	1
hi i am 11 i pool my backyard it just regular pool just swim hardly anything it accept well ..... just swim !!!! but then one day me , my mom , my dad , my brother all went toys us intertube because one we popped . then " rainbow reef fish " cought my eye . then i picked it up asked my mom dad if we could get it pool . they said yes we could but only if we payed it own money which i happened my money me my pocket day . so when we got home i got my bathing suit got fish i jumped right pool play it . i so excited !!! this great toy ! it especially fun go underwater goggles look it swim underneath water . i highly reccomend this toy . people who said it stopped working . just get new one it could fish . but it worth money	1
i bought it present someone who never one because her parents thought it waste money when it first came out	1
overall , this cute little set dress your child like superman w/o spending lots money . it comes vinyl cape , superman plastic chest emblem , plastic chain pull apart pretend like you're man steel . it probably fit average child up 6 or 7 years old . chest shield velcro straps top bottom stretch around child arm/shoulder area - so if your child particulary large , it may not comfortable wear this . vinyl cape attaches velcro neck . one velcro tabs fell off vinyl started rip ( underneath tab area ) very first day my son wore this . we took it back exchanged it one . even though cape doesn't seem extremely durable , i'd still recommend it fun accessory any little superman fan . one more thing ... i think cape superman shield would look better red instead reddish brown color they ended up using . i'm not sure how many kids would care too much color though !	1
i love this doll so my 2 year old my 5 year old . i couldn't get 2nd one before christmas just got hispanic version , which i think it cuter ( least computer ) than blonde caucasion baby . my daughters only speak spanish dora explorer , but this may help them - my 2 year old doesn't care which language she speaking , she seems know what she wants ! anyway - i would suggest this doll anyone ! i even like playing her !! lol :-) i agree not enough diapers too much food . right now we just " pretending " she eating , so we don't waste diapers . i'll give her a++ her hair thin , but her head dark , so you can't tell . not sure what blonde hair like	1
fact i could order game plus . fact it couldn't shipped me because i apo/fpo address made me mad . i send game my father , then him send it me . i trying order product gift friend . it given him month later rather than his birthday like i wanted . i'm assuming game okay because i give it him late . i don't understand why i order some games through amazon get them , but not other games same kind . this needs change .	1
my 3yr old watched cars innumerable times . his favorite part movie frank chasing mcqueen mater . this game it ! pieces small but more detailed than i expected . frank particular ok . game itself again better than i expected ( i very low expectations ) . you move around board , tipping ( collecting ) tractors way . you roll dice see how far go , one side dice causes frank wake up , move spot . he'll chase you back start if you're way . my 3yr old loves it . there numbers bottom tractors you're supposed add up . but thats too much work , we just count how many tractors there , or just roll dice try wake up frank ... or just play pieces	1
i three half year old son all he wanted christmas " mean tractor frank " . frank happens only vehicle they not make . this game it !!! out hundreds presents he recieved over last three days , little frank out this game his favorite toy world . oh he also likes play game . pieces extremely tiny . but my 2 year old also well them .	1
i'm huge fan leapfrog toys . but this one never clicked my twins . when they younger it took long accomplish each turn they got older , it just boring . every turn , game tells kids what , then they find letter card put it special slot . but there just so much talking singing going , kids get bored . they want game moves quickly this one doesn't it	1
we purchased this game my jus t-t urned 5-year-old . he loves play both levels . his almost 4-year-old friend enjoys limited play , 2-year-old loves just looking cards , calling out letters , playing plastic figures . couple letter sounds very similar , but it teaching alec listen carefully not get discouraged if he gets answer wrong first time . it also nice there no one " winner . " anyone who reaches " winners " square winner . my son sometimes just randomly calls out letters sounds they make . very good getting him ready school few months	1
she already knew how add subtract , but place value new concept her . boy , she learned it immediately , game so much fun her add cards you more addition/subtraction practice there well ! ;) she loves play this game , i really like concept bright colors . i just love it when learning fun children ! how it should , not dry or boring . your child love this game .	1
i wanted get my 20-month-old some fun but educational bath toys found market greatly lacking . i decided order these hoping they would solid plastic not hold water . i won't buy squirt type toys anymore my son because they impossible keep clean thrown away after few months . needless say , these squirt toys even though description says nothing it . i willing give toys benefit doubt because i really liked shape matching features my son stage where he loves matching shapes , colors , etc . i took them out mesh bag , which great bath toys though they could included suction cup hanging it up , i realized plastic some turtles extremely flimsy . when my son tries match shells turtles , body turtles just cave he can't get it . not all turtles this way , but most them . i regret wasting my money these . what rip off ! avoid all costs ! if you're looking fun , open-ended yet affordable tub toy , try tub stickers alex . there bunch varieties , they super easy clean come mesh bag suction cups hang up your bath or shower drip dry . my toddler loves them	1
i gave this my nephew his first birthday he my other nephew ( 4 years old ) love it ! it huge hit their favorite gift . i like it because it gives them hours play it folds up easily stored	1

my son only asked this christmas , so i get it . it doesn't much -- he bored it within few days . it shoots harmless " bullets " pretty far , but not easily aimed . pincher our first one didn't work so we send it back replacement . pincher still isn't very strong basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't " lift " objects , just grabs them drags them around -- you hold button continuously hold object . loud -- very loud -- legs hit floor very hard ( though i haven't noticed any scratches floor ) . we small house you hear bug one end other . i would not buy this again . there much more interactive rc toys out there	-1
i got this game play 5 other people during spring break , we definitely all good time playing it . we split into two teams , guys vs . girls . it wasn't stupid hard like " friends scene it " version . it little challenging , but we definitely knew lot answers . without doubt great party game . if you've got lot people both guys girls , you can't go wrong playing this ! this my first board game review , but i give it 4 stars .	1

i love leap pad , but there catch . we've bought 3 pads ( first one broke almost immediately ) , we've owned 10 different books . those 10 , only 3 still work . one got wet . several placed toy boxes or kicked under beds . once these books dropped few times , or buried under toys , they cease work correctly ( if all ) . they only cardboard , after all . children who get most benefit fun these toys young - say kindergarten through 3rd grade . older kids going less satisfied format , probably happier working actual computer . leap pad particularly great long car trips , but make sure little game cartridges don't go missing . also , wire connecting stylus pad become caught when pad shut - once wire ruined pad ruined too . i said , i think leap pad items great . they help child reading , spelling , basic math - all fun stress-free venue . but these books easily ruined little ones . your best bet may keep leap pad books pad out reach kids when you can't there supervise , so you oversee care handling books pad . leap pad good value , but only if you make it last while	1
this game easy play adapted different ages . it fun see 4 year olds strategize	1
this item looks ok , but website completely misleading saying it ships within 24 hours . i ordered this nov . 27th not receive it til dec . 8th . that nearly 2 weeks . it may not worth ordering online even free shipping , better fight crowds stores	1
well when we purchased this toy we read reviews here expected treads come off all time . well , lo behold our version terence doesn't this . they've redesigned him treads not come off . he fits track but not roll like other trains . pressure applied his wheels turn but he no way roll down hill his own . you could cut treads but wheels don't appear right size . sometimes treads get off their wheel grooves bit they seem like they may stretch out . our son still loves " terdence " but i would almost prefer old style so we could remove treads he would roll freely . messes up track too if it not secure . store both versions i now know may buy other one . difficult make everyone happy i realize , dad probably more concerned it than his son :	-1

black pearl playset absolutely worth money . my 6 year old daughter who loves capt . jack received this other mega block sets series . i ended up putting it together her while she entertained her grand parents . instructions really well . each step pictured simple understand notations large images . each piece fits like any other mega blocks or lego-type project . you just got make sure you press pieces together hard surface get them really lock well ( carpet building especially hard when attempting port royal playset . lol)it took me hour get black pearl together . this only because there so much going around me while i working . :-) yes , ship come apart while you playing it . my daughter didn't rip it half or anything - just part side pushed back . isn't part fun pirate ship battle two ships blowing holes into each other their cannons ? anyway , i've never known lego-type toy not come undone unless you permanently model glue them strategic places . i think i'll probably end up doing this ship . it quite pretty - you say pirate ship ?! lol - well detailed . figures really cool , too . each their little arms , legs , heads posable . all all , yes , i recommend this toy . i'm tempted buy keep it save decked out shelf . :-)	1

i agree many other reviewers this bike tips over very easily . my son know how pedal bike , yet this tips without any warning . he gotten caught underneath bike , handlebars turn so he needed help get bike off him so he could get up . only positive aspects we store ours outside it held up well , also , my son able reach pedals before he turned 2 ( he lttle under 50% height ) so he able learn pedal this bike . side note , 2 most positive reviews this bike over 18 months old , i think it quite possible they different model than what currently available	1
i bought original when my kids 5 3 , it good game them play together change . dvd game same concept , but more visual ; when announcer announces pad , possibilities show up screen . all pads animals ( no food , musical instruments , original ) , but there minimal animal education . kids might learn which animals farm animals , which ocean animals , etc . i think there less variation this game than original ; after few days play repeat games , i figure out ( but not my kids)which pad winning one . one best features original , it made my kids listen instructions . listening skills replaced visual cues dvd version .	1
i bought this doll my 4 year old because she saw this store really cried it . like previous reviews , it very loud annoying . also ballet skirt would not stay unless you held it down which hard when doll twirling around . my daughter rarely looked this doll past first day . i eventually gave it my neice but my sister brought it back next day complaining how loud annoying it . i finally took it salvation army .	1

my son ( 4-1/2 ) given this christmas gift it hands-down winner best toy household . we two other " marble run " toys - one made wood blocks other plastic - this far most creative , versatile exciting use . each color-coded blocks something little different , which makes endless variations building runs . " twist rail " set excellent starter since it such large variety pieces . there several layouts included pamphlet step-by-step illustrations our son follow himself . it takes us parents little playing remember what each color piece ; so it fun challenge young old alike . we can't wait add onto this set !! this heirloom-quality toy played many , many hours fun all us . it very sturdy well-designed . if you think terms money spent per hours play , this sound investment	1
this also my first review ever - but i felt compelled given our enthusiasm over this toy . we gave this set our son this christmas - he five next month - he whole family love it ! quality excellent well worth higher cost ( compared more inexpensive plastic runs ) . so far , my son wanted me build runs , but i know his confidence grows toy he take off into building his own . getting many marbles we , quickly we , going down run just flat out addictive fun ! we felt this great set start since ( reviewer said ) it comes both curved straight rails spiral teeter-totter . i'm already looking forward buying some accessory add-on sets my son birthday other holidays ! i'm sure we going get years enjoyment out this toy . i highly recommend it	1
my daughters fight over this thing all time 3 songs get annoying real quick but they all great time it ! microphone headset pretty much useless , doesn't fit any my kids properly ( ages 2 , 4 6 ) . it seems like it pretty well made andhas held up some mild abuse so far	1

i recently purchased this outdoor playhouse my 21-month-old daughter . i found product online , but able get it toys us price online ( i didn't pay shipping ) . overall , it great toy . seems big enough 2 children play inside together , but there other things outside around playhouse if there more than 2 children . one downside entrance into playhouse . porch leads into house but not level ground leaves step down which children easily trip over . my daughter stumbled first time she entered house , but now aware she needs watch her step . my daughter loves skylight , mail slot , doorbell , phone ... all big crowd pleasers . front bench very fun sturdy . there could more play inside house , but i guess what imaginations . only reason this playhouse not get 5 stars because safety issue front porch leading into house . manufacturers could thought idea out bit better	1

playmobil pirates sets perfect young children vivid imaginations . this my 4 year old favorite toy . we spend countless hours sailing high seas together . he selected ' skeleton ' pirate island set his own personae we call him captain bones . ship very well made withstood many dramatic battles against " bad pirates " . details what he most enjoys , like treasure , swords , goblets , lamps other small items come these sets . whenever i chase down captain bones shark figure , trying take bite his boney leg , my son laughs joy . makes this set my favorite toy well : most time i am watching him smiles rather than pirate my son assigned me . you get months months use out this set	1
i rather alarmed parent stated their child goes around dressed like prostitute . where parent ? who control ? sounds like this parent needs some therapy . i'm tired hearing people blame others or things mishaps happening their own backyard blaming it someone else . stop ! get some therapy . if you raise your child morals values , they good root thrive . if you don't , they grow uncontrolled . if you're trouble your little one right now , get some personal help so you obtain control ~ before she 16 pregnant , running away , or doing drugs . i've bought my 8 year old bratz dolls since they came out . she never asked dress like one . she around 50 these dolls . she plays them , but more interested discovery channel , reading , making all a , worshiping jesus . she straight student loves draw play piano . i not say i'm perfect , but i spend lot time my little one . i talk her dangers strangers what emergency situation . her dad takes her fishing i'm certified swim instructor ~ so i've taught her safety swim lessons . if you spend lot time your children , they idolize you .... not tv , not music they hear , not plastic dolls ..... but reality . yours truly , east texas	1

this toy seems hold my 4 yr old intertest well , but it not very durable all . it kept falling apart so i actually bought some model glue glued all parts together . now you can't open it up , but i no longer teary eyed little girl coming me pieces her hands .	-1
stop ! this may look cute , but any amount playing ( even breathing it ) cause it fall apart . this toy not last month our house . it never stayed together , top it comes 20 teeny tine " grooming pieces " ( not kidding , most smaller than dime ) definitely major disappointment my daughters who love strawberry shortcake horses	-1
toy trumpet beautifully made . my granddaughter happy it , however there no instruction how play different songs . there four colored buttons trumpet but no songs play we can't seem contact company who makes it	1
gamewright this way taking old standard- this case slapjack- adding couple minor improvements , turning it into something seems so much more . my 5 year old daughter loves this . i would reccommend this 5-7 year olds ... not so much older kids . i think beyond certain age this game lose little it luster ( gamewright masters grabbing kids ' attentions fun visuals ) certainly any developmental benefit .	1
well i bought this my mother-in-law who hooked su doku . i bought it just small token . price cheap i thought why not ? well it hard see screen . it also bit impractical if you realise you got number wrong 20 turns ago , you go delete all 20 turns you just spent time doing get it amend i t.t he price cheap , so i not expecting anything fancy but honest i disappointed it . when i realise i gotten number wrong i not bother trying find it , i just start new game . but fact so hard see screen find curser very annoying fact no one even bothers using it now . we just print out sheets web it old fashoned way pen paper clipboard . i said , no harm , it cheap thing anyhow	-1
it fun addictive game , but this hand held version little difficult control doesn't always sense when u push buttons	1

my 7 6 year old love their new game , mind wars junior . it like trivial pursuit different subject areas , like language , math , physical science , life science social studies ... give you idea , it questions dealing various subjects , like christopher columbus , gases , elements , antartica , martin luther king jr. lots more .... my kids didn't want stop playing it very easy hook up , all you plug it your system set board leap pad , turn it play ... it very easy understand they even repeat button , volume control game , all kids , go around many spaces game tells them after they push button , then they answer various questions , first one close all 5 subject windows wins ! there multiple choice , also true false questions ... lots fun ! :) very happy this item ! keep up awesome work leap frog ! i loved watching them play ... i give this definate 5 star rating ! next , i get one older kids .... 3rd grade up ...	1
i debating whether or not get deluxe or original i saw this review [ ... ] . " game excellent , but unless there some reason you cannot deal smaller pieces standard version , there no real reason get deluxe . " so if you same question , this may help .	1
this dog very large ty animal . fur extremely soft . very good product sale price	1
other reviewer fine job summarizing many features this game cartridge . what they didn't mention graphics terrible . pixelation so bad if you didn't already know engines you might not able recognize them . [ example , there station labeled tidmouth * something * . neither my husband nor myself make out what second word . ] said , knowing how thomas fans , nothing we've said keep you purchasing this cartridge because your child , like my 3.5 year-old son , probably like it regardless how lame it . so let me tell you more ... there four areas : learning zone , learning adventure , engine depot options ( music or off ) . * learning adventure * area you help thomas rest steamies their jobs . children supposed learn letters , object identification , colors counting . [ four games four subjects . ] general , all games require joystick . most games some sort obstacles , but easy level hitting obstacles doesn't end play . * learning adventure * zone : calling all engines - drive thomas pickup letters spell name . ---- bonus game - drive through cave collect coins before you time outflying rescue - fly harold hospital other locations using map upper left hand corner figure out where you . ( object identification)cargo catch-up - fly harold drop cargo into freight cars same colorbertie beats clock - bertie needs get children various stations . when station , you supposed count children getting off . ---- also this section `take break ' - counting/matching/odd one out*learning * zone : * learning zone * there four games which focus different skills . children supposed able learn size sorting , classification , counting puzzles . size sorting - use percy sort minerals into correct sized freight cars ( big boulders go into big trucks ; small rocks go into small cars)recycle challenge -troublesome trucks nearly full recycled items . you need grab same type item hook move it right car . count engines - count while engines pass byfix tracks - thomas coming tracks `not right ' . using joystick you rotate through variety track options . some tracks too big , others small or just not correct . when correct tract appears push big orange button confirm . * engine depot*in * engine depot * area ( rather lame ) you read thomas friends profiles . you also blow their whistles or berties case , blow his horn . gaming area you choose easy difficult options . example learning adventure area , game 1 (`calling all engines ' ) easy setting children find 3 engines collect letters tracks spell name engine ( such `toby ' ) . difficult level they still find 3 engines , but this time letters long name ( such `edward ' ) . we just opened game so i can't tell you too much more action game play , except my son daughter ( husband-lol ) seems very interested . four stars . old fashion ( read poor graphics ) . true thomas fan probably not care they get `drive ' thomas his friends ( including harold ) around sodor . age range , many these games beyond abilities -physically intellectually-of 3 year old [ map reading comes later ]; but should allow them `grow ' into game latter point	1
i bought this item my mom ( her early 50s ) she loves it ! she non-stop crossword puzzler just raves this product . she never search book lean , or pencil sharpener !! she always puzzle handy work ! puzzles range easy ( not silly easy ! ) hard ( good challenge ! )must	1
jack sparrow ring incredibly high quality . it not look like toy or cosmetic jewelry . it sturdily made detail surprising . green " gem " not look exactly like emerald , but overall this item probably one best deals price you find anywhere !	1

i say if i it over again , i never would let my son see fisher price catalog pick his christmas present . he saw shake go racetrack wanted it mater lightening mcqueen cars immediately . i am not so happy it because it takes lot keep race going . cars don't go more than 3-4 turns around race track before they shaken again then time race over , your wrist hurts . my son only 3 he doesn't know shake it enough so him , it just not fun . he likes it but easily gets discouraged it when he can't make cars go more than one lap , if . i would not recommend this 3-5 yr . olds . maybe older kids , but i wouldn't buy it again . i wish i could get my money back , but box all it wrappings went out christmas wrap trash . not waste your money	-1
we received this our baby shower set it up when danica 4 weeks old . first she would just stare toys . one day she reached them . day she touched one . day she grabbed it . one day she got music sound . one day she tall enough touch toys kick ball same time . it so exciting watching her development this toy . after she could sit up , she loved ripping toys off their velcro . when she started crawling , she would take ball off carry it around her hand . she now walking she uses this her private cabana . i give her snack she sneaks away this ( set crawl position ) . i've uploaded picture her sitting it up-side-down like boat , watching backyardigans , so check above . she loves sitting it when it turned like this . i promised this toy so many people , thinking she outgrow it soon . she turns year next week she shows no signs getting bored it . she found new , quite unexpected , way play it . it grown her well beyond my imagination . she outgrown her crib , her walker , her exersaucer , her bouncy chair . this toy outlasted them all	1
my baby loves this toy , however , afer couple weeks she can't play it anymore , because we don't triangular screwdriver change batteries octopus makes music when baby hits or touches it . this toy fantastic , my baby loves it so much up until it died !!! i think fisher-price/mattel should include tool change battery , otherwise , i would render this toy completely useless	1

we bought this our 2 year old son christmas gift . we can't wait see look his face few days . it very solid construction should stand up years use . walls different shapes/objects molded into them , some it quite detailed , but it all same color . so my wife i purchased some plastic paints local craft store painted some objects walls add more detail realism . it cheap easy , results speak themselves . we painted fruit store wall , atm etc . inside my wife painted globe , books , tools hanging wall , bank safe tire . it looks very cool now . this house doesn't any sound effects or lighting , so i purchased wireless doorbell battery operated light home depot . total cost paints electronincs $25 easy . rather than spending extra $100 more detail electronics , this very cost effective fun way make house even better . i think my son going love it . i'll post pictures when i get time .	1
i purchased this case store my son little touch leap pad books cartridges but they not fit . case much bigger than i thought it would but it still not fit little touch leap pad itself there . my son just got my first leap pad christmas this one fit there . i am glad we found use it or i would sending it back refund . make sure you know which system you using it before purchasing make sure it fit	1
why i wait so long ? after months leap pad books their cartridges floating all over my son bedroom floor ~ finally they all home . this handy little storage system hold most children leap pad library books cartridges . it certainly hold enough keep your child happy quite while . this perfect drag adventure . price what kept me buying storage container when i bought system . silly ~ since i so much more invested system its books . i finally took plunge couldn't happier . now when we dash off adventure ~ everything ready go . it also great tool encourage your child put everything away when they playing it	1

if you're looking way organize your puzzles , this it ! great job , kids pretty well getting them in/out . i wish there way adjust sizes racks , but i haven't seen anything like	1
puzzle rack great theory ................... concept this awesome , but unfortunately my 18 1/2 month old liked dump it out all puzzles it throw it ............... you probably know , this age most kids dump everything , so i am sure i am not alone here ............. some sharp edges , also not appropriate this age . like i said , theory it great which why i didn't return it , i just put it away closet couple months until i think she get concept no longer dump it .................. still recommend it	1
this non-toxic markers paint washable . crayons watercolors certified cp markers pencils certified ap . clean clothing might watercolor paint , it advised not use pre-wash or chlorine bleach . this should also kept away wallpaper , painted walls , finished unfinished wood vinyl . my son this time he four seven liked it but prefer his magna doodle over it . set up easy all pieces fitting into each other slots . order use easel correctly two purple trays must situated just right red container . this work two ways because if you not want use green stand you move trays out bit turn around then slide paper under clip start drawing , painting or coloring . clip also removable easy snap into place . when you storing this you place clip paper supplies under trays . we paint stains many spots , but they easy remove cloth or wipe . use stand you would lift up red blue sections place stand slots provided . two purple trays removed before doing this supplies close hand not turn this around over . both purple trays small section watercolor tray . when easel used there small groove hold two markers one pencil . trays even slide upside down . one down fall this if you using it portable reasons it gets loud items moving there .	1
excellent strategy game . moves , including just rotation peice , van serious consequences . various configuration starting positions keep any single strategy consistently successful . just started using it my son ( age 7 ) i anxious continue experimenting . no doubt " cool factor " laser game some effect his enthusiasm , but he learning strategy well . company also quickly replaced defective game without any problems . highly recommende	1
i got this game my birthday ( i'm 35 ) i love it ! it like high-tech version chess . definitely makes you think hard try plot out your moves many steps advance . it especially tricky because you simultaneously think offensively defensively . if you like classic strategic boardgames , you'll love this game	1
this bucket lego blocks great creative tool . pieces varied sizes shapes which jumpstart imagination . set definitely helps develop fine motor skills smaller pieces require little hands work diligently . one word caution . if your goal build houses or any other kinds buildings , you need purchase bucket legos purpose . this set not contain enough actual building bricks job , but this bucket legos would make great addition such set	1
people saying they don't like this doll because she too much makeup her outfit looks goth . 1 . why you looking this doll if you problem what she looks like ? 2 . she supposed look goth , duh ! 3 . i think she cool i'm buying her .	1

this great bike . i ride it all time my 5 year olds twins ... who just starting able ride it . i found nothing better than this bike . it brakes which nice our hilly driveway . kettrike sloopy nice but it doesn't brakes . it surprising more products aren't made 5-10 year olds these days . pretty much anyone who not fat ride this trike	1
i read lot reviews it seems largest complaint , if any , regarding leaking plugs . well , table bryce got his 1st b-day ( 4/11/07 ) no plugs it , so i guess step2 figured out it better no plugs avoid leaks . i'd agree . we set this up house because it too cold outside . bryce loads fun ! only improvement i'd make this point wheel tower attach table . reviewer mentioned , tower tips over very easily typically first thing get thrown . i'm sure it broken before summer over because this . i intended give it only 4 stars because this , but submitted review too quickly . oh well ! other reviewers wanted lid table because they're worried debris when outside . it takes 1 minute tip over , pour out old water , spray out hose , fill back up . i personally know i'd more diligent doing this than stopping put lid back after play over . all , great investment kids who love splash !	1
my son 20 mths old loves this water table . he so excited get it . only thing , he thinks it pool wants crawl it .. haha ... needless say , since it only got 3 legs , it not sturdy toddlers wanting crawl into it . but other than , great toy	1
this great fun summer time . i purchased one my daughter one her cousin . they love it it provides loads entertainment holds up pretty well elements .	1
i like this coffee maker . it makes coffee pretty fast . one thing against it spout small you need pour very slow or it pour over sides . after first two cups it becomes alot easier pour . i would buy same one again . it nice looking coffee maker	1
my 5-year-old 8-year-old love this game . i took it church function one day later kids there begged me bring it back again ! it says ages 6-9 , but i think real age range much broader . i bought extra keep hand last-minute birthday gift ! buy " lunchbox " version , though , because it hard get cards back into little paper box storage	1
my sister gave this my 15 month old daughter last christmas . soon i saw it , i knew she would love it i right . others mentioned , chair back issue , but our pops right back . chair also " tub " my daughter pretends pooh bed covers him his " towel " she calls his blankie . she takes duck bathtub her . she almost two now i would recommend this toy	1
i think it important give this kids right age . i bought book fingerpaints my son when he 2 , he not interested . but , he not interested any drawing/painting general . he 3.5 now , he just found he old book digging through his stuff , he amazed it - he finished it one evening . he still doesn't like coloring crayons - this requires too much patience - but paints different story . fingerpaints especially interesting him because element surprise - they all white but appear color paper , delay color apperance , while irritating first , now cool . yes , paints bit messy . no color , but they stay face , clothes , ect ., so again , make sure your child not too young , understands where paint should go	1
finally paint set where i don't worry spills or messes ! my kids thrilled receive this " santa " christmas . they love paint but i always discouraged it house . ( we galley kitchen , carpet dining room . worried carpet . ) well no longer ! they loved able paint it kept them occupied least 20 minutes , i didn't hover over them . i admit my youngest daughter dig into her paint , it all gone . but she learning use it correctly her older sister . i know we buying more future more fun !	1
good part : this thing fly high , soar currents , lot fun once you get hang it . i would recommend it someone least some experience ! controls touchy it spiral ground if you hold too long . it pretty tough take some hard hits without damage . bad part : i only got eight good charges out eight aa batteries am experimenting charging 12v mower battery . rechargeable aa ( " pure energy " ) available canadian company . great plane kids little bi-plane " air hog " . it practically bulletproof , easy fly , doesn't eat up batteries	1
i am avid r/c enthusiast - i couldn't wait try this toy see if it really flew ! so here scoop .... 1 ) there should almost no wind present if you want any chance successful flight - resist temptation fly gusty or strong winds . 2 ) right left controls very sensistive - turn requires one second control input - any more than turn become massive spiral - it looks cool - but you may only get one chance see it ! 3 ) fly large open area .. bottom line - very cool toy - it fly , fact it looks very cool flight . it very quick plane like this . if you low wind , go easy controls big area fly it you should blast - if not , choose something else so your not disappointed	1
i shopped extensively amazon best price . wagon assembled which easy . husband didn't swear actually commented quality hardwoods flush mounted screws . i thought i would use additional water sealant but wagon nicely finished . oh , one other thing standard baby bassinet mattress fits beautifully some padding . handle longer than generation ago , my 6'1 " husband comfortable pulling wagon	1
i received this wagon christmas 23 years ago , little refurbishing my son . my sisters i played our wagons all time kids --- hauling each other , dirt , dolls , neighbors-etc . all over neigborhood . mine played but great condition until 3 years ago when my older sister left it out rain few months ! ( her kids played them left them out ) whole inside wood panel warped beyond repair it developed some rust here there rained repeatedly . our dad really mad -- because he paid good money wagons ( we each one , 3 all -- yes , she left them all out rain ) so i decided refurbish it . i took it apart , sanded it , repainted red panels , stained sealed wood , repainted black metal decided switch tires out air tires similar those atw wagon . i also replaced wood panel you sit inside -- so basically all parts original except tires wood panel seat . it looks new again my son loves it ! it cost 20$ repair ( wood , paint , stain ) tires optional since there nothing wrong originals . well worth putting work into -- i still great wagon ! if you take care this wagon don't leave it out elements it last you long time ! ( i said , until 3 years ago it like new ) we also purchased pads -- love them	1
this great polly lovers . my little girl loves this . it wasn't all hard put together .	1
like others mentioned this not sturdiest toys . you must place it solid level surface , otherwise it wobbles pieces disconnect/fall apart . parents perspective , i am greatly disappointed overall quality . this obviously not well thought out . it designed easily broken down storage . unfortunately ... too easily , playing it sometimes troublesome , especially when little hands trying deal small space scale polly pocket toys demand . said , my daughter loves it not stopped playing it two days now . child gets bored single toy quite easily , ringing endorsement not put fully into words . best recommendation ... if you going buy this , wait sale	-1
packaging this product unacceptable . first table i received completely beat up/busted every corner . i sent it back only recieve second one same condition ... poorly packaged damaged beyond use . i didn't even take it out box ... damage visible through broken packaging everywhere . price free shipping catch , but it game see what you'll get . i guess this why they $49.99 . you're lucky if you get one you use . i not lucky	-1
you get this game your leapster , if you don't one yet , get whole system ! it just awesome ! my five-year-old loves , loves , loves this game . although it meant 4th graders , he no problems math questions which all answered prior going next level . it all batman villans - joker , mr. freeze , cluemaster , etc . math questions get harder higher levels i passed out when my five-year-old learning scalene triangles dimensions isosoles triangle breezing through it like it nothing . then , my husband gets ahold it just cannot put it down . all this say this very , very addictive they should put warning label ! this great son dad game play too , especially when it projected onto television leapster l-max . if you know someone who hates math , all means buy this game . it certainly erase all provide very , very enjoyable learning experience well . you just can't get better toy or better learning tool . praise god leapfrog . we've buying their stuff since my son born everything so wonderful . this absolutely far one best inventions yet learning . absolutely unbelievable . love this game i highly recommend it !	1
we advanced 6 year old who loves this game . she no tomboy , but rather " barbie " girl . i reluctant getting this her , but it turns out she adores playing it . we got this game her l-max .	1
we love brio train set , process collecting brio set each our sons birthdays christmas ' . wood soft enough so child rough it toss it around it may get dented , but doesnt break . only negative this particular set plastic scenery pieces dont seem stand well wooden stands . other than , we loyal brio buyers because you collect your hearts content always know they mix match other sets	1
i got this my son who just turned 5 years old time . first , he scared it not want it his room , but after he discovered how you use tools extract various guts organs , he loved it !.. we both take turns drawing it . drawings come off completely when washed . this really sparked creativity my son . i highly recommend it	1
i purchased this toy gift my 5 year-old nephew it big hit . he received many other gifts but open this one right away start playing it . he 2 other children spent quite while drawing it toghether ... all boys . it nice it something they could play together . i purchased toy not realizing you could open head pull out brain chest pull out heart ect . i initially not too comfortable this feature toy . however , when boys played it , they initially laughed parts then paid little attention them . these parts not very realistic looking good quick chuckle . my nephew continues play it frequently it washes well . i suggested it few other people young boys	1
i purchased this item my 4 , almost 5 year old . it way over his head ... not surprisingly it almost over mine . stated review , this looks more like rescue vehicle than firetruck ... also ... multiple pieces come this toy make it much more advanced toy ... not really 3 year old . manufacter recommended age 36 months 8 years . i would say more like 6 8 years no less . i almost feel like it collectors item should sitting shelf ... so you don't lose it parts ... but i not think manufactuer intended it so . unless your child perfectionist super detailed ... this really isn't toy them ( my opinion , course )	1
set comes nice box - important if you considering gift giving . looks very nice box . pieces same somewhat brittle plastic always used toy swords . they not stand up hacking rock instance , but they fine waving around like crazy . they hard enough really hurt if your two year old gets ahold one starts slashing . five year old i purchased these however , they perfect . two different sizes swords then protective gear make it nice set . helmet too small children much older than five but weapons look good enoght entice slightly older kids . glad i bought it , would worth it even original $12.00 price	1
these blocks looked better picture . they made cardboard fairly insubstantial money .	1
just what i looking sleeping bag built-in air mattress . great camping or sleepovers . well made good deal	1
if there 0 stars , that what it would get . my kid insisted buying this crap . i said it okay , hoping she wouldn't eat it . then she cooked it her easy bake .. very excited it .. i absoloutly refused let her eat it . it gross . smell revolting . she ate it anyway nearly threw up . thanks but .. gross .	-1
i think this one greatest ride-ons younger toddler ! i bought this my 18 month old daughter she absolutely loves it ! yes , it doesn't reverse , but my opinion , this ride-on more " first " training ride-on . i don't want my daughter learning how flip switch reverse 18 months ! she loves go around back yard it she hasn't gotten stuck once . i give it 5 stars !!!	1
we got this set our 5 year-old after he requested similar set cost $99 playmobil ! only $25 , this bargain ! it very sturdy ( we not any problems pieces falling off/apart or pieces not fitting properly - it simple snap-together process get pieces ) . there several cool features - although , others mentioned , there no " friend/foe " recognition feature fortress only " eagle " thing we could find small black bird looked more like crow/raven . we lots luck imaginext line products - we also pirate ship , which we purchased last year . sets come lots fun " extras " , like trap doors things move , open , close , etc . these allow lots imaginative play your children . my son also loves he rearrange pieces put castle or pirate ship together way he wants - he rearranges them all time he no problem getting pieces together them stay ( again , he 5 ) , so it really easy put together . i gave this medium score educational value it great imaginative play learning cause/effect , but there really no " academic " features . still , it great toy hours fun our home we would recommend this or any other imaginext set anyone ! price , i cannot imagine getting anything better , or anything could even come close	1
we got this castle our 5-year-old son , last christmas . it pretty cool . one problem , though , it seemed , it must assembled one spot kept there . if you move it , it'll likely fall apart . 5 , our son really didn't play it much . however , this fall , he begun really spend time it . first , fact it fell apart so easily after assembly frustrating him . now , it major benefit . he doesn't go " rules " . he put it together whichever way he wants . he become very creative it -- even designing constructing new additions it his own . when you're buying christmas , it'd fun get them everything their list -- but not very appropriate . we try choose things their durability their ability let our children create use their own imaginations -- rather than tv or computer or video games doing things them . this castle great purchase . we got thrill when we saw him start playing it extensively again -- year after he got it . that kind toy i want my house .	1
my son 7 yrs old we like this lot . it interactive ( batman voice , " tell me secret code " , " access granted/denied " , " tell me secret code again " , etc . ) inside secret drawers . you program number pattern open it , or use voice recognition . we difficulty getting it recognize his voice but it still very fun . he ends up opening it numbers instead . there hidden reset button if you forget password , or want change your voice	1

we bought this puzzle our daughter first birthday - hoping counter some noisier toys we suspected she would recieve ( she ) . our great pleasure it well-recieved , something she enjoys tinkering whilst making her rounds toys . pieces large - unlike so many first puzzles - made out thick , sturdy plywood . they painted non-toxic paints , rather than layer paper like many other puzzles which so quickly become soggy unusable first time they find their way into mouth . only downside pieces slightly rough edges - i think i may end up taking piece sandpaper them some point just smooth them out bit . , other reviewer noted , this cause difficulty getting pieces . despite this minor flaw this excellent learning tool young toddlers , i highly recommend it	1

my 6 year old loves underwater animals this beautiful puzzles captures them all . both my 6 4 year old making this puzzle year they love making it over over . it nice big , strong pieces won't bend easily .	1
my two girls ( aged 4.5 3 ) love puzzles . they different likes dislikes so we our house " my puzzles " " your puzzles . " but this one first " our puzzle . " it challenging enough both girls work together -- one tropical fish other dolphins , example -- what joy when patches would come together . different areas puzzle would take different hue blue ( ocean goes deeper color darkens , course ) , so girls sort out pieces start different " foci " floor . therefore this puzzle really helps them learn multi-tasking , organization , team work . it definitely step forward 24-piece or 50-piece sets , while still remaining manageable preschoolers . my only minor , minor complaint one stretch puzzle ( sperm whale area ) dark , bit simplistic design , somehow not preferred either girls -- so i would always assigned complete portion ; just little warning you may find yourself putting together giant sperm whale couple times day . bonus -- chart teaches children names all sea creatures puzzle	1
our 3+ toddler loves cinderella , so this under tree this past christmas . though fancy shoes fell off immediately ( i hid them since they pose choking hazard our 2 year old ) doll withstood tough toddler test time since december . press small button her back , dress sparkle light up while playing song , dream wish your heart makes " ( quite loudly i must add) ! doll beautiful likeness beloved disney princess , but her hair so stiff it doesn't welcome children play it , dress not come off , no-no little ones , since wand pointy piece plastic , it went way shoes avoid poking and/or choking hazard . though box states ages 3 up , i'd recommend this one more 5+ even more so doll collector since dress so unique well made . it comes pretty box too . overall really nice doll	1
my 4 year old daughter huge princess fan , loves cinderella . so when we got full size carriage , we got twinkle lights cinderella doll too . but she not very popular my daughter , because you can't change her clothes . since her dress wired light up twinkle when you press button , it stay her . so if your child like mine loves change her dolls ' outfits , this doll won't played too much	1

these baseplates important if your little one likes build structures legos . i'd recommend attaching them board ( i wood-glued 6 them board , added some molding , put sliders underneath so i could store board under beds or sofas ) so they won't flex . otherwise , you'll definitely need encourage your child play these table or other hard surface , warn them moving their constructions spot might result creations coming apart	1
this comment response completely irrelevant post tiffkilner ; perhaps she should get life instead attacking honest helpful reviewers site . it clear big gray board 125 sq . larger than large green baseplate previous reviewer erroneously lists extra 25 sq . extra play value . considering market this toy aged 3 12 years old , pointing out such significant error quite valuable . i not know many 3 year olds compute area basic shape so such errors pointed out imperative such audiences . what importance how large green baseplate rank value versus big gray board -- make asinine remark just because you not share views commentor truly unwarranted . reviewer named " g-had " , it shame you not fully accredit large green baseplate full-blown toy -- merely " part " toy . such debasement integral vital component lego universe shows how narrow minded you . must i remind you there other reviewers able obtain hours replay value just single big gray board piece alone . i concede versatility large green baseplate somewhat dimished smaller surface area green color . however , this piece deserves honored one major innovations lego brick system . furthermore , i suspect you may posting your review this product fraudulanetly your review hints you not comprehend basic facts this product . please recheck your facts ** play ** toy before posting review . this toy clearly 10 " 10 " not 15 " 15 " . your lack knowledge such basic fact toy suggests you never played this toy before let alone pleasure enjoy pure delight playing this piece . i deplore you please remove your review this product or revise your rating until you chance play this piece . i would interested your honest opinion regarding this piece well much-vaunted big gray board ** after ** you played them	1

we've played this game 10 times each time it played out differently . it takes 40 minutes play out game ; there not many decisions make each turn so game move quickly . we've played both two four handed - it worked both ways . counter keeping score bit funky , but not distract .	1
i am glad i bought this game . it not involve any money or any pen paper ( which rather unusual ! ) scoring moving people around 50 point track , if you lap it , you get 50 point card addition whatever else you point track . this keeps focus game-play , while still allowing point reference throughout game . pieces ( box ) high quality , game enjoyed children well adults . reason i like this game two players play this game alone , sometimes it hard find games like . you typically two owners game third person ( friend ? ) who comes over plays less often always disadvantage . also , game doesn't last too long . you not going get bogged down hours , you " get game " before you go bed , or before you go out . if you enjoy this game , there some expansion sets this game you also purchase . they each add additional pieces additional rules , they change strategy make it more interesting ( just when you might getting tired game ! )they following : carcassonne inns cathedralscarcassonne traders builderscarcassonne princess dragoncarcassonne towercarcassonne river ( sort mini-expansion)if , however , you think you would like purchase them all once , instead one one down road , you elect purchase " carcassonne : big box " instead . this contains full original game well all expansions listed above . it bundled together big discount , well big space savings -no extra boxes lying around . addition , if you enjoy carcassonne , you also purchase separate standalone games related carcassonne , but which not expansions , which cannot played part original game ( or any expansions listed above ) . they following : carcassonne hunters gathererscarcassonne castlecarcassonne citycarcassonne ark covenantfinally , those who enjoyed this game , i must also recommend other strategy games manufacturer , rio grande games . i also purchased strategy card games " lost cities " " san juan " this manufacturer , enjoyed them immensely well !	1

this so cute ! i think st. bernard cutest , but i love them all ! they so cute inexpencive . there few moderate cons , though : 1 . cat sometimes falls over . 2 . pieces get lost easly . 3 . if you put collar st. bernard , his head doesn't bobble . 4 . illustration bunny , he hes ice skates . but ice skates don't fit him ! even those cons way , this one my favorite lps .	1

true grimm fairy tale hansel gretel not pleasant picture most interpretations show it . here figure shows terror should filled little hansel . stand alone figure , it not best this series ; alongside gretel figure , it gets twisted its own right it looks though gretel not candy witch who tortures him . this one may most delicate set but still great rendered piece sculptor . its own it only gets three stars , set , it moves up four stars	1
our 17 month old son received this playhouse christmas it big hit !!! it just right size our living room not huge any means but not small either fits nicely corner . he loves closing opening door . it only took my husband , brother , dad 20 minutes put together .	1
we bought this house our son when he one year old , age 4 1/2 he his still using it -- even sharing his little ( 1 year old ) brother . both boys love it hiding place when we play hide seek , they both use it imaginative play their own intiative . course they also love diving out through side window . . . but we very pleased this purchase . one caveat : we initially installed house kids ' playroom ( what most people call living room ) keep it nicer while , set up nice play area rainy days . however we now item put spot want move it outdoors , but it won't fit through our front door or sliding back doors -- roof just shade too wide , we've difficulty reversing screws take roof off . so indoors it still . i'd say width roof only design flaw ; otherwise we completely satisfied product	1

i like simon hand held because you start following pattern stopping point when you lose . then you frusterated determined it again . even if you beat simon it still calling you play again . it very addicting hand held . i go o.t. my theripist introduced me simon i started playing it i spent 30 minutes trying beat simon . i beat him once i beat him again right when i leave . i still can't beat it again . my theripist tryed it wasn't even close . she spent 10 minutes figuring it out . she didn't get after 10 minutes gave up . so if you decide make more simon hand helds , your sake money you might want make it more difficult so it even more addicting .	1
simon excellent tool improving memory . it stimulates mind provides great satisfaction way . handheld version compact easily carried around your pocket . i absolutely love it whenever i am little down , i play it immediately forget my troubles . i recommend this all kids especially adults who trouble remembering	1

i two daughters so my husband i purchased two these dolls christmas . my seven year old plays her doll more than my five year old . my five year old says doll talks too much she wishes she would just go sleep quiet . my daughters given just every doll comes out i thought this would their favorite boy i dissapointed when i learned otherwise . doll isnt worth 100.00 or even close it . wait until price goes down . both dolls lips peeled within first couple days doll . my daughters take excellent care their toys so i know this wasnt their fault . i dont know what happened voice recognition . because both dolls respond anyone . yes ! i read instructions yes i programmed doll properly . i noticed some saying they not any problems their dolls lot us same problems dolls . which steers me believe obvious ... some us got stuck some major malfunctioning dolls . i've reprogrammed doll twice just make sure yep its doll . what waste money ! still interested ? just make sure you one functions properly if not you sadly dissapointed	1
i can't believe this ! i remember begining 90s , people treated 80s lllooooooooonnnggg time ago , i completely different era . i only 5 when 90s started , but it still drove me mad 90s when people talked how lllllooonnngg ago 80s . whenever people 90s said things like " oh , happened way back there 80s " i'd just get confused look my face ! it just few years ago people ! now , what this this game ? well , people today doing exact same thing ! they treat 90s way back there , even though we're just few years removed 90s ! news , music , culture 90s not way back time . far i'm concerned , they still fall under category " current events " opposed " ancient history " label people starting give them . its 2005 people ! 90s aren't ancient yet	-1
i introduced 90 game over weekend , i honestly say i am hooked . format game absolutely perfect , questions cover complete social , political , business issues relevant 1990 . length game totally depends how savy you your 90 trivia . board game action get surprisingly intense , i would consider this must buy	1
i owned toy store this dollhouse i selected my daughter ( who then 2 ) . she now 3 loved every minute playing this house , furniture dolls . house withstood rambunctious play , * i * only one break furniture ( i stepped chair heavy boot i wearing -- but amazingly , only leg popped off , rest chair still intact could fixed if i motivation ... ) dolls beautiful , heavy felt wired body easy movement . they unlike other dollhouse dolls wooden heads pegged bodies , which i felt inappropriate young child . all all , this brightly colored , well made dollhouse should last my daughter until she old enough either grow out it , or want grow traditional , hand-made set .	1
within six months owning this 50% furniture fell pieces . some wodd glue clamp fix but price you should not make constant repairs . save your money	1
i would love review it but i never received this product , therefore i never purchase amazon again !!!	-1

whoever writing comments memory size wrong how nuch it holds . it hold 2 hours music 128kbits sound isn't too bad using your own cutom eq setting . if yours isn't , you're converting improperly !. it works fine fm tuner it besides holding pretty low quality video . i 4 different types/brands mp3 players there no comparison this my 80gig ipod but 350 . i got mine ebay 12 bucks new box which can't beat . paying 60 walmart or anywhere else way too much ( there certainly many other units price don't video but least 512mb if not gig ) . look ebay folks ! pet	1
i bought this my 9 y/o nephew christmas he wanting it since his birthday . it seems hottest toy get right now . i think your price $399 you charging totally outrageous this toy whoever buys it price even more stupid . i bought it toys-r-us $79 . they also it target , walmart etc . you must out your mind sell this price , it cute toy but it definitely not worth over $100 . even my nephew agrees	1
my 1-year old son loves this toy . it amazes me see how he figures out all himself how put ball into basket	1
my son got this christmas , even though he wasn't quite 9 months old . he liked it beginning played it , but now ( 12 months ) all i listen crowd cheer . if he can't find basketball , he'll put anything fit into basket . football used our favorite , but now it less so . my son trying hit baseball bat lights up every time , though only once he able make ball move . i no problems this i thought it fairly easy assemble myself . i've even given this gift others because my son loves it so much . i especially love it 2 sound levels , so outside it louder return , it slightly quiter inside	1
this toy very good . you build some very interesting different things ... out box regular blocks toys . this child imagination . my son i ( grandpa ) played it while kids where playing other games . it many things build unusual things . recently my grandson build crab claws .. you roll it claws open close . very nice	1

i bought this toy my son year ago , when he turned 4 . he loves it ! especially since pirates carribean came out . he spends hours playing island battle castle , which we also love . there few complaints previous buyers amount pieces fact it falls apart . there lot small pieces accessories we put little " treasure box " we bought walmart . ( just $3 box little buckle lock . ) our son stores small pieces there he hasn't lost any small pieces year . when he wants fully accesorize his island , he pulls them out sets them up . ( but he pretty organized kid . ) we love accessories because it adds so much adventure . island pretty compact if you follow instructions use little 3 prong footers . if you don't , it fall apart fairly easily . our son pick entire island up carry it room without it falling apart . note : if your child trashes things lot or likes hit , bang smash their toys , then this probably not toy them . but if they take care their toys vivid imagination , this toy them . all all , we love this toy would definitely purchase it again ! he got battle castle same year ( stated earlier ) we just got glow dark pirate ship which he loves ! we're going get pirate raider glow dark shark skeleton next .	1
this item horrible . it falls apart constantly . we tried hot gluing superglue , however , nothing works . even our 4-1/2 yr son told us throw this out he so frustrated . part appeal you take imaginext items reconfigure them , great concept . however , no matter how you configure them , they all fall apart . during assembly notice they not " click " you would expect . pieces never lock together , even bottom " base " pieces . we resorted putting all imaginext table him play , however , flat surface , bumpy surface , any surface , it falls apart . please not waste your money we . unfortunately we spent approximately $150 various imaginext last christmas . not make same mistake we . when 4-1/2 yr wants you throw out his toys , somethings wrong	-1
this one cheapest toys we got our daughter , it turned out one her favorites too . she also loved mator . small simple best little kids , i wish we would learned earlier	1

i recieved car set it up according manufacturers instructions it didn't work ! i contacted manufacturer they mailed me shipping return label i returned it them . i am awaiting new or fixed car back them	-1
this really fun game . my grumpy husband who usually plays very little sit hours play this game . instructions easy understand , it type game you invite friend over they play easily after just one hand . very enjoyable	1
this game become one our favorites ! it helps develop math skills while fun . our older kids love how they " re-arrange " tiles laid out benefit their own hand . this game immense fun not only kids but also adults	1
i got this pogo thinking you could go 6 feet air but then it wouldn't go much higher than foot . if you're looking pogo looks cool you sould definately get this but if you looking pogo works don't get this .	-1
my son received this product christmas it didn't work . we tried calling manufacturer help number , but they only offered pre-recorded help referred you their website . unfortunately , we couldn't find website tnt ric . we end up exchanging it discovery channel store one it works great . it easily stunts shown box . i'm now ordering one my nephew but tell his mom exchange it if there any problems	1
my son 4 years old . he really into thomas just amazed first time we started reading polar express played video . i playing idea getting this set him christmas opted get bachmann thomas sets since i not seen one these person he " really " into thomas tank engine . after christmas , major department store these 50% off suggested retail price . i could not pass this up . department store also one these display . all i say " wow " . locomotive actually metal . it smokes ; it whistle ; it lights up ; it train . power pack nice stout also . anyone who train sets kid , this blast past . it reminds me more my father lionel set 40-50s than plastic one i got one christmas kid . it very well detailed . i would probably paid full price felt ok it since it good quality . bell nice touch . figures neither here nor there . maybe if kids little older they might better . just note : fireman not same long hair video . track lot easier work than old lionel pins back day . you not need tack pieces down keep track together either . locomotive moves smoothly . it heavy stays track well . cars light up brightly . 4 years old , my son primarily watches hits whistle button . he operated speed little . track would tough him work . stick geo trax or wooden thomas if you not going work with/supervise your kids this . but then , set also recommended ages 8 above . minor downsides . when we tested unit , tender mid rail pickup not fully inserted shorted wheels next it . we fixed this all well . this item may packaging issue but appears ok now . i not run set up full throttle , but it looks like it might derail full speed . ( we this table derailing it would meant doing " drop " test . ) this just means someone needs good judgement experience setting speed . train also slow start after you set speed . ( i am not sure if this intended simulate inertia or not . ) again this probably means you want patient person throttle . other thoughts . it o scale ... so it takes up space . you rerail these easier than ho . radius curves included set , coaches seem little long . we also picked up hot chocolate car local retailer it sale . coaches plastic but look good . summary : i would definitely buy this set again . locomotive looks awesome accessories bit expensive ( my opinion least ) . bachmanns thomas sets good year round thing , but this one seems like it something special around christmas time	1
this solid first-quality train set would well worth asking price even if it wasn't affiliated popular book movie . fact , locomotive scaled-down model real locomotive , berkshire used pere marquette railroad ran near author home when he growing up . it lucky coincidence locomotive author painted book one lionel modeling since 1950s , all they change " paint job " create this fine model . case you wondered , this best steam locomotive lionel includes any its train sets . passenger cars also based same class real-world cars author painted book . number comments here fact first " run " train sold out before it even hit warehouses 2004 . nowadays , rush isn't so great , but doesn't mean there won't last-minute " run " set if network station shows movie december . unlike most " christmas trains , " though , this set tasteful enough used any o gauge railroad all year round . it built like lionel trains your grandfather grew up , solid enough last generations . happy holidays - paul race , editor , big christmas trains	1
great set buy ! it truly worth price $250.00 . only thing i wish it would come more track . because it only comes small oval track . but it still great set . i highly recommend it ! set very much resembles berksire cars movie . but good luck finding one until february	1
child , i played this game family vacations . rules simple , yet engaging . adults kids alike play pretty equal ground . kids like high-energy pace , adults amused idea " cornering market . " maybe i say because my father stock broker so it great hearing his over top analysis after each game . i can't really think anything negative say , except maybe your children might grow up , like me , inflated sense value wheat ( most valuable commodity game )	1
we introduced this game - big orange box , cards , bell - when i kid . i hadn't seen it years then i found it drugstore . i heard my family talking it , gave pack cards i bought my mom , since then it huge hit during holidays when family gets together . i just home christmas we loads fun . it get really noisey . i always recommend version bell because otherwise it not clear cut start finish , although you decide opening closing anouncement . very easy play introduce others , i didn't even realize until recently it meant teach kids stock market . fascinating ! if you love play games , this must your game cupboard	1
this my kids favorit game , my favorit play them . it goes fast you stop any time . you don't sit around wating your turn you don't remind your kids it there turn . every one plays same time . it get little loud all shouting . it realy easy concept understand . my 6 year old play it just fine . it best play least four people . i love fact this game almost 100 years old . you know it must good if it still around	1
i got this moon sand my kids christmas i gave it them early christmas gift . boy mistake ! it more heasdach then playdough ever . sand everywhere ! yes you may able vacume it up but we lost 1/4 sand first play . playdough you make sure there kitchen so when it falls it no big deal , you pick up big peices droped add them back mix , moon sand goes everywhere aside fact it doesn't come very much sand begin so course you need buy more which works well manufacture because they continuing customer . once this i happy show it garbage save me headach .	1
we bought this item my 3 year old , who just discovered playdoh , birthday gift . it far superior anything we able purchase locally our major retailers ~ shapes colors great , not all food related , which plus us , since we discouraging eating playdoh , obvious reasons . i would highly recommend anyone who looking great starter set their little ones learn love play doh	1
other then getting headache building set my son , its over 1000 pieces , i no complaints . it become central focus his super hero obsession his bedroom . none components difficult build , although spiral staircase cool its bit poorly designed because it often " collapses " rough play . addition while rotating car pad pretty neat , expect one single lego middle get broken second younger child trys spin platform hand . but onto good things ; detail excellent computer screens joker bomb glass case . mr. freeze just coolest lego man i seen , you get classic gray batman , robin , penguin , penquin sub , snowmobile robin , larger snowmocar batman penguin sub . my only grip there nothing mr. freeze ride/drive but if your child anything like mine remedied short order . it would nice if they labeled bags like batmobile/two-face chase set , 1000+ legos difficult sort through , but if you prepared then this set more than worth price your child love it years come	1
we purchased this sandbox several months ago after reading all positive reviews this website . it lived up its five star rating ! our toddler really enjoys playing this sand box . " natural " design reminds him stone castle he loves king his sandbox ! we filled it 200 pounds play sand still lots room numerous trucks , shovels , rakes , pails , seashells , sifters assorted sand toys . lid sturdy ( my son stood it it always pops back into shape ) high , domed center allows us store everything inside . we several violent wind/rain storms , lid stayed securely kept sand perfectly dry . i don't think color-fading over years issue tan plastic ( unlike some bright red or green sandboxes we also considered ) . 4 corner seats allow kids ( some parents ! ) sit play without getting sand their pants . you fit 1 , 2 or 3 small children or around box one time , but i don't think it large enough bigger crowd . you won't disappointed this sandbox ! it provide your kids many hours fun	1
we got this sandbox my younger son first birthday . we now it year . we it our backyard our patio it looks great . really blends not eyesore . rounded top very sturdy boys ( now 2 almost 4 ) stand it it doesn't bow or anything . however it lightweight enough easily taken off . we live southern coast where we get lots wind , rain sun . it held up marvelously still looks new . we lot mold mildew problems our outside toys because humidity , but this held up very well . we've never leaking problems either . i like seats corners kids sit . although they most often sit right sand course . we keep all sand toys housed box which convenient . we careful spiders deciding make it their home , but i just make sure check it before they begin playing . it easily fits 2-3 children plenty room . i would highly recommend this sandbox	1

let me first say i love kidkraft because they think like parents ! also , 12/9/06 amazon not correct image this item , pictures kidkraft trundle natural color , not honey . these trundles came my son train table kidkraft . i drawn them many reasons : * they big !!!! you can't fit all train pieces those other tables pull out drawers or tiny baskets slide underneath table . i love two trudles size table - huge ! *they casters . easy , easy out ! my kid it so i don't ! they easy enough roll around my 2-year-old son it his own . if you look carefully trundles , you'll see there even cut-outs small fingers grab trundles so they move them . it impossible smash your fingers trundle table . * they easy kids organize ! one side trundle rope handle , while other side chalkboard plate so you label what each ! ( or i , draw picture train picture train tracks so my kiddo knows what what since he can't read yet)*again , i mention they huge ?? these trundles well made casters fitting easily into place screwing pre-drilled hole . simple washer fits over top lays flush inside table so little ones can't hurt themselves sharp screws or hardware . my husband i these both put together ( he one while i other ) 10 minutes max . like i said beginning , these well thought out . i love features trundles - i'm sure parent involved creating these ! i also believe you get what you pay , while these some more ' expensive ' trundles market , they well worth it . after year play , they holding up just fine , very little wear tear ( that 2-year-old ! )	1
great twist traditional trivia game . advanced players like strategy involved deciding who you want guess first other small nuances . best part you fun geniuses those missing few tools toolbox ; everyone involved every round , so there no down time	1
i got it christmas . but i didn't open it until 29th . i started 5 p.m. ended 9 p.m. 4 hrs !!! last 2 days screaming serpent but didn't work planned . i don't know why though . i'll try again july 28 . anyway , if you're gonna get knex set someone they're rookie or never it before , i totally recommend this set . it greatest k'nex set i ever owned	1
all k'nex we bought , this one dissappointment . others stated , overall design clumsey cheap looking . chain mechanism works ok assistance , sliders fall off or get stuck . our son very clever these toys he confused instructions . oh yeah ... we several missing pieces .... maybe that why !! i say this though ... we got ours 50% off that only consolation buying this toy	1
assembly time : 3-4 hours ( 1 adult ) . time till broken : 45 mins ( 2 kids , ages 3 7 ) . gear system works motor pulling riders up top " canyon " broke less than one hour what i would consider average non-abusive play . chain flows around two gears , but when tiny bit resistance encountered , it gets stuck . there not enough torque overcome nominal resistance , even just overcome sprocket used adjust which chute rider goes down . i think it great concept , great toy , but apparently more thought or " horsepower " needs built into most important element product . once this broke , kids completely disinterested it . not mention seeing four hours time down " slide " just because manufacturer didn't properly qa or engineer $80 toy . i also agree other reviewers who said riders often get stuck , fall off , tumble upside down don't behave " auto-pilot " . however , this engage kids , provided more laughter than anything else it 45 min fun filled life . yes , we tried fresh batteries , chain right way ;)	-1
i 2 month old grandson living me , he cholic . sweet boy , but he barely ever wants you set him down . needless say few christmas gifts i bought , we pulled out play little bit early . this wonderful toy ! one most comforting things my grandson talked soft calm voice . i saw this toy shelf i am type who pushes all buttons test before buying . voice very soothing voice sweet " i love you baby " end perfect ! my grandson so far loves this toy . he doesn't take well many , but this one great animations music , keeps him interested ... best all it makes him laugh ! something he doesn't often yet . course we shake rattle ... but i am sure he learn how soon enough . definte 5 stars just hear him laugh smile ! recommended any finicky child	1
this most cutest toy i ever seen ....... i hope my baby love it much mum dad ..... * smil	1
bought this our 10 month old , even though it says ages 3 up . he really liked it would crawl through it quite bit . i am giving it 5 stars because it quality product great price	1

my 9 month old can't turn pages well normal books , so i got her this plastic one . it reads her , activities push or pull , lights up , sings her . pooh reinforces words we're already teaching her like up , down , right left , numbers . it takes aa batteries really easy change them . this great way introduce her one my childhood favorites .	1
i'm not sure who rating this but my expectations high this toy based all these raters giving this gadget 5 stars . i'm sorry say i don't think so . you cannot use it voice changer without record something each time . there other voice changers allow you add voice effects you speak . not this one . reduces fun effect . microphone doesn't capture voice well speakers weak . i play it near someone ear them hear it or tell all stay silent . reducing fun even more . some one here said you even clip it somewhere ? no clips found . nevertheless you still get giggles ( 1st star ) plus it includes batteries play out box ( 2nd star ) .	1
this my nine-year-old son favorite spy gadget . he got several cost lot more more bells whistles , but this one ends up his pocket most . he uses it more silliness than spying , but ends up giggles every time . it went through laundry once still works so i'm impressed its durability	1
i got this my almost 5 year old . she loves it plays it constantly , even after it 2 months . toy extremely durable . it dropped , left out very cold car , sat , etc . i only two issues this toy they 1 ) it very loud when not cushioned surface 2 ) sticks pictured left ariel not stay holder all . we lost one them . other than , i really like feature offered although sound quality when you play it yourself limited , it great overall	1
this game so much like " trivial pursuit " , you could use questions categories any those editions handicap game even further . i played two young adults ( under 18 ) some questions younger players completely unknown them . best part you only answer one question turn ( right or wrong ) so " ken jennings " can't win game first roll dice . there aren't enough questions supplied game , but i noted above , any multi-category trivia game questions used keep game interesting . overall , excellent purchase families enjoy evening trivia	1
my daughter got amigo bear christmas . she very interested spanish -- dora , sesame street all . she plays it trys imitate spanish words through out day . today bear became her " baby ' well . fun times not annoying	1
i intended buy kelly doll my 4 yo grandniece , but when i found this , i knew she'd love it ( which she ) . not only she get kelly , but she got 4 friends too , all things girls need pj party	1
my daughter two , almost 3 3 months . she likes it well enough , but fact paint takes moment react show up frustrating her . i love paint inclosed brush , but difficult get out paint i hesitate showing her she squeeze it . whole point keep it brush , yes ? perhaps if they caps prevent it drying out brushes could stay moist paint ? paint comes out one place , so its all concentrated center brush , so you need work it bristles , or big globs paint go throught it faster . side note , paint dries crunchy clothes . also , my local target this set extra brush , 9.99 michaels it 11.99 , no shipping !	1
i ordered this tamagotchi my granddaughter valentine day . she looking v4 one stores weeks they sold out . she very excited received this it hit !	1
i 4 y.o. boy this produce right up his alley . we lot rescue heros this product brings them al together . this what he wanting play all his men vehicles . mission command center easy put together very durable . my boy loves destroy toys he cannot tear this up .	1
first negative . men go this , rh mission select men no longer made . they difficult find after market price , some cases , higher than price new rh . only other negative price it would nice some ' cubbies ' store back packs , etc . now positive . if you mission select rescue heroes then this great toy . figures talking back forth each other offer new level play . but talking figures not take away imagination play your child . it merely provides backdrop their play . this not big other command center boat . large positive my mind it even folds down bit when not use . note , not folds down carry around , it just folds into itself bit making it bit more compact . contrary one review this not difficult set up . it took young boy age 7 his mother less than 30 minutes get up running ready play . directions clear easy follow . every part this , even back , something rescue heroes . there climbing wall search light ( doesn't really work too bad ! ) crane life cars or people or animals ( according my son ) up top roof . rescue heroes all accompanying items such command center very fun . they positive characters save lives . they large so small hands easily play them yet there enough ' small items ' like backpacks even older children fun switching backpacks around so . every piece this set , rescue heroes command center well played stood up well hours play . enjoy .	1
i know one main complaint there no more mission select rescue heroes figures left stores , they discontinued , some aftermarket prices getting up there ( especially rocky canyon , hardest find set ) . well , robotz figure line stores now features figures same connectors their back , so you get them talk . i don't know if it main phrases would said if you mission select figures , but they talk . instance , when i hook mission select backpack billy blazes ( only mission select figure we ) up rocky canyon , rocky says phrase each turn dial . they sound like follow up phrases , if he second figure communicating mission select figure , but you still get some voice interaction !! mission select , voice tech , robotz figures should all come same metal contacts their backs ( except ones like robotz gil gripper , whose robot stands alone not connect him ) , so they all work some way each other items . macc , it definitely center rescue heroes world , biggest playset released toy line date . while it may not most exciting , it gives your children central area congregate figures vehicles . least it keep figures all over house ! i think size money , it could featured some trap doors or compartments , but elevator mission command voices rh leader warren waters all you get	1
my daughter received this doll christmas , her sister received blonde version not bilingual . they really enjoyed playing interacting dolls . we not found cloth legs drawback all , instead find dolls little more cuddly way . my girls 3 4 i also home daycare all girls here ( well my 3 older sons ) periodically picked up these babies play them . i would go 5 stars but voice quality sometimes less than perfect	1

this story fish who glittery scales . all other fish wanted like rainbow fish , so they would invite him play them . rainbow fish self-centered always said no . once little blue fish asked if he could glittery scale , but rainbow fish said no . all other fish grew angry him not speak him . rainbow fish worried went advice wise octopus . octopus told rainbow fish kind others not selfish . so rainbow fish went back home gave little blue fish scale . blue fish so happy he couldn't wait show off his glittery scale . soon after , all fish wanted glittery scales . rainbow fish gave everyone scale became friends again . i think this great book children because it teaches them lesson . lesson learned always share you'll many friends .	1
my son saw this pirate ship wanted it , even though he beautiful large wooden one . i gave bought it him his birthday . it loaded little pieces make detail impressive . my husband put it together , it didn't take him very long . i highly recommend it great pirate ship any age	1
we got this our pirate-obsessed 4 year old christmas - it now august , i'd guess he played it almost every day since then . i know some people complain its fragility quot ; tiny-nessquot ; some pieces , but i think this great way teach child care his belongings - we've still got just every piece , included those four tiny wine goblets . it also great developing small muscle control - our son gotten very adept putting tiny swords tiny hands , loves mixing matching hair , beards , etc . it probably not every child - but i pretty much worship playmobil !! no other toys come close capturing pur son imagination attention	1
playmobil toys wonderful , no question , but more elaborate they , more problematic . this ship gorgeous great detail , including real string rigging . this toy took forever assemble , especially pesky rigging , usually excellent insrtuctions falling short . after day playing , my two boys dismantled ship enough it wasn't fun anymore , after three days i could no longer get all parts back together . it now somewhat expensive box filler . other playmobil pirate sets still much loved , conscripted nearly invincible good ship fisher-price	1
i bought this my daughter room so she could listen classical music while she sleeps . i going buy regular cd player then i seen this one . it matches her room beautifully works great . she too little carry it around or use it herself ( she 1 1/2 ) , but she loves her " pretty radio " she calls it . we haven't any problems ours " toxic " cord , i plugged it once i don't plan moving it so its not problem me . only thing i don't like cd player skips if you bump it . it doesn't happen if you walk it or shut dresser drawer hard , only if you tap it or bump it accident . i thought odd considering it designed carried around , but since ours just sits dresser i don't problem it unless i hit it . overall it great cd player . adorable functional !	1
this item great i got this two months ago it still works just fine i making movies my friends awhile now we always lightsaber fights we hit hard we both my friends i make movies others they both well work just fine they've them longer but only problem waving sound little sensitive even who needs batteries any way it shoots up self thats good enough me .	1

this product absolutely useless . " paint " so thin it not work advertised . you cannot write it body or walls . complete waste money	-1
my 4 yr old begged begged this toy i finally gave when i found it clearance . after playing it maybe hour , even he said " mommy , this waste money ! " if he doesn't follow directions exactly order said , or tries skip ahead , game unable keep up then he gets frustrated . i'm really glad we didn't pay anything close full price this useless piece plastic	1
item just awsome . we play it every night . we could only purchase department stores cards not complete game . it so much more fun board	1
after struggling find gift she would enjoy would also provide little educational content , i'm happy i wound up choosing global puzzle . it good challenge her , but not so difficult she got frustrated or bored gave up . i would gladly recommend this product others children this age range .	1
during christmas , i bought this puzzle entertain my 5 , 6 8 year old nieces nephews while my sister cooked dinner . i am not puzzle person , but thought it might keep them busy teach them something same time . i right . what surprised me how much fun i 29 year old completing puzzle ! i shocked how little geography i knew . during holidays , we ball completing puzzle saved it . each time i come over , we go look puzzle identify new places members our family traveled . great product	1
okay , so it not really educational , however , my older kids , who big snl fans , gotten good sense older shows game . we've blast playing this together . little game pieces snl characters , however , they mostly recent ( land shark conehead only older ones . ) pieces cute though ! really funny . one disappointing thing while dvd plays portion skit , it doesn't play whole skit . surely , dvd ( part $40 game ! ) , they could included entire skits . i like questions general , found game challenging , but not overwhelmingly challenging . i think it great average snl fan	1
this so fun i love saturday night live i love this game go sparta	1
my son loved this book so much he got up 6 a.m. next day ( lucky me ! ) just play it . unlike most toys , this one stayed close used frequently since then . so this would bargain even full price . this discounted price , wow	1
i bought this my 5 year old son . this far best leap pad book he received . he played it almost daily over month now . cards make it extra fun him they easy keep track if you keep book/disc cards package .	1
wonderful learning toy ... well made everyone loved bright colors ! thank you selling quality toys well worth amount paid ... which more than reasonable .	1
i bought this toy thinking , " well , it plays music ... maybe it keep my son occupied . " he loves it ! he spins tummy wheel over over again ! you may find yourself humming music times like i ! there on/off switch back so you don't wear battery down , also 2 volume levels so you set it loud or soft . luke face lights up every time i bring it out . it doesn't bounce or tricks , but tummy lights up plays music when you spin it , my 8-month old play ever it ! any child who loves spin things or play balls blast this little elephant ... it even sings 2 bedtime songs . singing voice very soft gentle , making it even more appealing . price , it definitely worth purchasing	1
" idea " adorable it looks amazing box , but actualy product very poor quality . it takes forever blow up , then we couldn't get headboard part stand up straight . it kept leaning . construction very poor also . sides attached oddly not made last ( hard explain , but it not one sold piece , each section seperate ) . ours also slow leak would partially deflate morning causing castle ( which already leaning ) collapes . i called , e-mailed wrote company get replacement ( i couldn't return it ) they would never respond . you leave voicemail message company i couldn't get live person . after 3 months i gave up junk sitting closet . i wish disney didn't allow their name put this product	-1
this one most frustrating toys i ever used my child ! it not work :	-1
my 5 year old daughter , who seen me return home pottery studio my works hand , really excited received her own pottery wheel her birthday . we both greatly disappointed find wheel power so insufficient each time she even gently placed her hands clay , wheel came grinding halt . given this , it impossible even teach her basics centering clay , let alone create any sort thrown piece . i not expect this work well wheels i use , but i expect she could least learn few fundamental skills . this product completely disappointing i would not recommend it , particularly if there no parent throwing experience . if this best product out there , i recommend sticking hand building clay -- they learn thrown wheel when they old enough go proper studio	-1
i purchased my granddaughter . she love bake this great educational tool	1
if you love sugar cookies , chocolate cookies , yellow cake i really , really think you should get this super value pack , ' cause instead just getting 4 easy-bake mixes , you get 12 mixes , i don't know you , but i think great super value i think you should go nearest toysrus , or where ever you get your mixes get this easy-bake oven super value pack	1
dangles so soft , squishy cuddly ! we got this our son when he just few months old . it quickly became his favorite snuggle toy . he 1 year old now must his monkey snuggle order go sleep . unfortunately he likes suck his tail it get quite yucky . fortunatley dangles washes very well ! i put him washer handwash cycle then tumble him dry 90 minutes fluff/no heat dryer he ready go time next nap ! although he not perfectly soft fluffy he when we got him , what you expect toy washed washing machine constantly dragged around ! i rated dangles 3 stars educational value . you might not think stuffed toy educational , but we think he ! when we ask our son where monkey eyes , mouth , nose ears , he points right them . he gets his hands feet mixed up , but he'll figure it out soon ! we purchased extra dangles nana house avoid crisis forgetting bring him .	1
combined jump-o-line this toy great . they not maintain thier shape very well but that fine because they soft safe . younger kids use them games learn colors . soon they more stock i'm buying two three hundred	1

my entire family loves this card game . it fast-moving , playing pairs results unpredictable moments . teams try advance car race collecting using mileage cards , while their opponents try give them flat tires car accidents using " hazard " cards . although directions may seem complex , it takes just few minutes understand rules this simple game . it nice portable game those who travel	1

i bought several these use our church . they excellent alternative standard globe . i didn't want spend bunch money regular globes , we don't lot room store them . these globes deflated easily stored when they're not use . also , if you using them classroom , you want child identify country globe , you simple throw it them . believe it or not , we didn't any trouble kids getting rambunctious it , but it keep their interest	1
my 7 year old son thinks these planets really cool realistic looking . he now name all planets he thinks they realy neat look day or night . i would give this 5 stars but intensity glow not very bright even if i leave lights awhile before bed time	1
we completely disappointed this set . our boys ( ages 3 5 ) received it gift ... i certainly hope purchaser didn't pay $20 ! planets flimsy plastic balls two pieces . they various sizes , but not remotely scale . fishing line tacks tedious assemble . gift buyers should sure recipients want attach nine planets their celing tacks extra adhesive putty ( not everyone ! ) . we would much rather cool mobile where planets could rotate around sun ( which missing this set ) . ours going trash soon	1
we got this over two years ago my daughter when she 6 months old . we looking mobile wasn't " traditional . " she still loves it so her baby sis . yes , there isn't sun , but if you look proportions , you would need beach ball sun ! we hung planets differ lengths fishing line . our only problem jupiter too low we kept hitting it . easy fix . don't forget put star stickers star tacks . if tack fall out ceiling , you use flashlight night locate it quickly !	1
my 8 year old 6 year old love this game ! it genius make game played 3 ways . never get bored it . although my daughters love horses , so couldn't possibly ever happen	1

my 8 year old daughter loves horses mad riding . she loves game - partly gameplay partly information game cards ( which list colours , breeds characteristic markings horses ) . fact there three variations game some solitaire versions included just bonus	1
i surprised how strong spring . it works great , really only kids , obviously doesn't look realistic adults . good laugh	1
my only gripe colors , ha ha ha ... seriously , got some these just because i'm immature wanted play even though i'm bit old it i suppose ... ended up loving them , quite surprised what you get so little money really . kudos toy cheap versatile , fact , works described !!!	1
i originally purchased 4 these my husband father day play our three boys $5.00 each plus free shipping , i thought if they didn't work , what heck , i spent $20.00 they pretend they work ! well , when they opened them up got them figured out , ( it took good hour because they very sophisticated)they didn't put them down all day ! i wished i would bought one everyone their friends block ! what great value ! they play them everyday- outside inside ! i am so glad i got these-a very good bonding experience father sons ! week after i received these , i went circuit city sure enough , these shelf $50.00 each ! you won't regret this purchase !	1
these little gadgets pretty fun play games them good way take break work few minutes !	1
my son saw this advertised tv begged it christmas . i looked it everywhere finally found one last one shelf right before christmas thought it great score . wrong ! after playing it 10 minutes , watching alien " balls " fizzle like alka seltzers til they exposed couple cheap , plastic toys , he completely lost interest . van poorly constructed parts not fit back , nor it stay together . just try store it shelf without it falling apart spilling its contents everywhere . this piece junk going right give-away bag . my son won't miss it	-1

i bought this my eight year old christmas bunch " whats popular now " toys . this far toy kept his attention more than few minutes . more like nearly 2 hours first time we took it out . it also kept my 6 year old daughter every adventerous 4 year old busy . i keep dad digging dusting or else kids wouldn't gotten turn . after finding three bones - i told them it time put it away save it day . my husband wouldn't quit 30 minutes until they found unearthed one more bone . they many hours fun left which return give them added bonus -- not only they fun ; but learning same time !! one consideration it say ages 8 above , but my 4 year old his sun glasses managed quite well . his only problem getting dad out way !!! highly recommend !	1
i'm really pleased this toy . i didn't want one would fall over easy or spoke spanish . i just wanted simple toy my son would enjoy longer than 5 minutes . this it . my 13 month old pull himself up easily it play it . i lean it against wall since it would slide hardwood floors but we haven't any problems it . he keeps going back it play it it one first toys he plays morning . i think because it so many things he doesn't get bored easily . it alphabet numbers well colors texture shapes . then you switch it music ( which he loves dance ) keys all light up which grabs his attention . my 4 year old enjoys playing it well .	1
this product lot different things touch press . my son play this while before he even thinks getting bored . he especially loves picking up balls underneath unit , standing up putting them through chute . my son 13 months , my only complaint myself not purchasing this toy earlier !	1

my 8 1/2 year old daughter got this four years ago christmas i honestly say it one our most used toys ! it set up all over house outside too . up until last year she would still sleepovers it ( it getting little small her now ) . but it still taken out set up quite often . i usually set it up myself ( i am 5'tall , less than 100 lbs . it extremely easy simple me . ) unlike previous reviewer , we never problems tearing , it amazingly durable . i 18 month old now , he also loving it . i use just tunnel him sometimes , too ! we love it so much i am getting one my two nieces this christmas . this one toy you get lot miles out !	1
rather than call boggle jr game i would call it educational tool . it very boring ! it several dice each sides labeled w/a letter . there also flash cards you put holder cover up either 3 or 4 letter words look picture spell words dice . that basically it . whoever spells most words correctly wins . not most fun game but would great teach or improve childs spelling	1
interesting reading other reviews . i guess if you very strict interpretation what game , you may disappointed there no music , beeper , timer , or lights . i think there clearly winner this game , it my 3 yr old learning word recognition . he knows his alphabet , but this game shows him all those letters make words . my son gets very excited when he see he completed word . i think this game excellent learning tool . i also breathe sigh relief when i find game or toy these days not lights , sounds , batteries . i however , add one sidenote , agree reviewer . we found couple words not formed , because occasionally two letters needed form word same block . you eventually spell letter changing blocks around . this definetly error make things tricky little one . however , it only couple words	1
all my friends family love this game , always wanting play or borrower it . so many people looked it stores yet find it , i say you buy it amazon . we played all types friends family , even our grandparents who their late 70s love it , well cousins there teens	1

this game teaches math skills , reading using reasoning skills . te animation wonderful sponge bob crew keep my 5 year odl daughter enternained hours ! great buy !	1
idea this game child helps sponge bob collect ingredients create new secret sauce . animation cute , but games too easy ( my son 4 ) it takes too long collect ingredients . once enough ingredients collected , child then gets play " kitchen chemistry " which not much fun . child either guess recipe or tap or spongebob get it . patrick taste test it funny watch his reactions , but " kitchen chemistry " just not exciting , interesting nor challenging enough keep child coming back more . addition " kitchen chemistry " , cartridge four other games : " counting claw " : 3 levels , deals counting change . child sticks coins into slot until he put right amount . my son blindly sticks coins slot until spongebob reacts . then he enjoys playing claw machine game wacky prizes come out . but he learns nothing . " conveyor chaos " : very similiar bunny game comes leapster system . little better , but not very versatile . " musical garden " : child only play assorted sea music until timer runs out . child symphony not played back . music appreciation ?? whatever . " bubble scrubber " : one redeeming game this cartridge . unfortunately it only deals 4 letter words . there nothing entice child try more challenging levels . i get my son start using level 3 instead 1 playing it him now he prefers level 3 . although i know value repetition , few more words would nice . after experiencing first grade ( which still my son favorite ) , i disapointed . this game only mediocore .	1
once again , amazon sold this toy lowest price $3.99 . later i found out nursery addition house includes twins .	1
i wish i could give this toy zero stars , but amazon doesn't rating . this item selling like crazy ebay , so when i found it here , i snapped it up . normally , i don't buy things until i've able check them out first hand . this precisely reason why . i opened this figure pushed button make it work . first time , it just made panting noise like scrat character movie . 2nd time , it collapsed tipped over made more panting noises . every other time i tried operate toy , it one those two actions . i honestly can't tell if i got broken toy or if this supposed how toy works . it looks like toy suppose scoot across ground , but mine tends tip over most time . either way , it doesn't really anything . i think even youngest kids bored this toy after 20 minutes it'll end up bottom toy box after . , now , i'm wondering why i so interested toy begin . my advice would save your money , because , unless you get it like [ ... ] or less , it not worth it	-1

this got coolest lightsaber i ever purchased ! granted , it my first fx saber , but not my first master replica . hilt details amazingly accurate blade lot brighter than i expected ( especially only three aa batteries ) . my only problem now which one get next ; obi-wan ( episode iii ) , luke ( vi ) , or darth maul ( double-bladed version ) ..	1
hilt very well constructed doesn't feel flismy like some other fx lightsabers . ease changing batteries also welcome change ( see anakin skywalker blade ) . tip blade looks cheap , always . some point , mr got create slightly-tapered , one piece " sheath " leds electronics , but i'm sure would add cost . color blade nice , but same problem darth maul saber ... red gets washed out bright areas , while dark , if you look relatively closely , there dark spots blade where individual leds connect . sounds both good bad ; power-up/down idle hum loud more menacing than good guy sabers . triggered slash/clash sounds kind bleh ... they sound good , but extremely unpredictable ( sometimes swinging it all you're worth doesn't produce peep , while slightly shifting your hands handle could trigger it several times ) . this problem any fx line if batteries low or compartment loose , but what mr customer service told me , this problem more common/prevalent vader blade	1

we used this monitor ( dual receivers ) 2 different houses now over 18 months . we think monitor very sensitive ; i hear my son breathing if i turn up receiver volume , other relatively quiet noises register light display well . we love lights it allows us other things ( like talk phone or play music ) still know if our child needs us ; they also great night , we usually leave volume very low . only static issues we when we plugged certain types electronics into same outlet receiver it created bad hum , when we left our cellphones right next receiver it would occasionally chirp . when plugged there always low white-noise background hiss , also visible 1 constant bar light , not there when they run batteries , but this neither loud nor troublesome even my normally sensitive ears unless volume very high . we specifically wanted model would run outlet power , but appreciate we occasionally unplug take monitor outside battery power while we yardwork . overall we very pleased . added bonus , units durable enough we let our toddler " discover " how they work carry them around without worry or damage	1
this monitor not work well . this lot static it not sensitive sound . this one going back	-1

we bought this my daughter her 2nd birthday . it best 6 volt ride-on toy i found . i lot research most little ride-on 2-3 year old either too small(her knee hit handlebars she very petite ) , too slow ( they wouldn't go grass or up any slopes also only 2 mph ) . this one perfect size 2 year old i think she fit it couple more years . it say up age 5 or 6 up 50lb . we going get her barbie jeep but they just too big her she couldn't even reach peddal . pro's:-great size 2-4 year old's-great speed 3.5 mph ( fast enough you need little helmet if riding cement)-light enough ( you pick it up one hand put it back garage)-cute color little girl pink purple-very durable-battery stay charged forever . ( we only charged it first time she rode it 3 hours 29 day later it still going strong)-goes our grass small rock area fine ( sometime we give it just little nudge keep it going these areas)-good price $99 sear free shipping time . con's:-doesn't adjustmeant speed so it could go little slower when they just learning . -doesn't reverse . -battery located under seat only velcro holding it together . ( although my daughter hasn't yet figured it out)-you can't take battery out charge it like your counter , you hook up charger bike . -steering isn't all great , can't make sharp turns . ( fine if you large area them ride)-assembly took longer then 10 minutes me . you need someone muscle hammer last bolt . 30 minutes me then i wait untill my hubby came home hammer bolt . all all i would recommend it .

our son really likes sink his teeth this toy . easy use wash . makes good noise get his attention but not overwhelming	1
this one my favorite games . it also excellent way enrich one vocabulary . this day i recommend using dictionary when you play just sure no neologisms sneak . still , extent which other players try win fun game itself . i love this game !	1
scrabble word game anybody play long they spell language which game played . it lot fun but it wise dictionary hand settle disputes arise when somebody creates dubious word or spelling . dictionary should only used settle disputes - leafing through its pages trying find word fits your letters definitely cheating . game intended played two four players but it possible practise alone i'll explain how later , though it isn't much fun playing against person . if more than four people available , they either team up or just find something else use instead racks hold tiles . scrabble comes various editions but all them certain things common . there 100 tiles each letter them , four racks ( one hold each payer tiles ) bag into which all tiles placed start game which all players draw letters game progresses . main playing area board 15 15 squares , most which standard gray color . some squares red , pink , dark blue or pale blue - these premium-scoring squares ( triple word , double word , triple letter , double letter respectively ) . begin , each player draws seven tiles bag . first player makes word any or all their letters places it board , beginning , ending or crossing central square , which automatically gives them double word score . ( it pink ) replaces used tiles corresponding number tiles bag . subsequently , players take turns create new word ( thereby building crossword board ) , attempting score many points possible . any tiles added must all form part one word link tiles already board but strategy well vocabulary useful . most time , you just place letters focusing existing tile board , using tile part word you create , however , if you letter your rack , you may able add it end existing word while also using it part word your own , if there clear room board you so . thus , you score your own word but you also score word you made into plural . this just one example how you ( sometimes ) score more than word while sticking rules , but it teaches you not waste letters - keep them when they most effectively used . when there no more tiles bag , play continues until one player uses up all their tiles or nobody able . point , points unused tiles still players ' racks deducted their score . play alone quite simple , if less satisfying . object score many points possible . obviously , scoring much easier since you build crossword very open design - you aren't trying block your opponents - but if you find those opponents usually beat you , bit practice your own might improve your chances beating them future . so , if you decide buy scrabble , it comes down deciding whether buy deluxe edition ( if you afford it ) , travel edition ( taking away home you ) or standard edition . just make sure you dictionary hand settle disputes , otherwise it won't much fun	1
scrabble my favorite board game all time . it fun play not ever get boring . game not only fun challenging but it very educational . game made up 30% luck 70% skill . this perfect percentage breakdown . there enough luck involved so everyone chance win(if skill levels not too different ) enough skill involved so game not ever become boring	1

this my second replogle globe . replogle best ! their pioneer world globe little everything ( well almost ) . it shows major cities , raised relief mountains , ocean currents , color-coded countries states , legend . like most their globes , it also comes plastic time zone dial over north pole , so you sort figure out what time it other parts world compared others . my favorite feature which stands out among others its gyroscopic apparatus , which enables you tilt earth upside down without lifting its base , so you see antarctica its entirety . other lower-priced globes , you lift whole globe , base gets way , so you really cannot see antarctica . there two things i dislike this globe . it no topographical information , but i suppose what atlantis world globe . ( i guess you cannot everything . ) also , it scratches easily , so don't bang it around . insignificant thing i notice placement political information . because globe constructed strips cardboard ( like orange peels ) , none city , state , or country names printed across two strips . it not take away quality information ; it just quirky look . i am very detailed-oriented pay attention everything . most you probably not even notice this	1
although cold nose puppies cute cuddly , my children love playing them , i am still very disappointed would not buy this toy again because mentioned other reviews , battery packs not stay inside toy . velcro not stay fastened . i am tempted sew this toy together , but would create problem when it time replace batteries . i cannot believe manufacturer would design such poor battery compartment . amount money toy cost , i expected it designed much better	1
i bought cold nose puppy my little sister she really likes she not want share it	1
rules two sentences long off you go . terrific gateway game people who played othello but maybe never played " euro game " . rules lines dominoes components quite nice . lots room improvement more you play , but early plays equally rewarding . great great game	1
after playing enjoying lost cities game designer reiner knizia , i decided stop our local game store check out ingenious . last night my wife i played it first time , lost cities , we loved it . immediately after playing we wanted play again . there no doubt my mind we not tire game . common quality lost cities ingenious share " addiction " factor ; both games you saying " let play again " over over again expense sleep . i don't believe greater compliment said game than this . ingenious incredibly easy learn , takes less than 1 minute after setting game up you begin playing . game play consists playing hexagonal chips 6 different colors board turn-based play . chips like hexagonal dominoes , 2 hexes connected , each hex containing different color . once no chips placed upon board , game over . player who lowest amount points any 6 colors loses . game strategy requires you score points each color , this requires concentration strategy . understand ingenious not strategy game leave you frustrated , overwhelmed weary . no , ingenious not like . ingenious just enough strategy you scampering win , just enough random luck make it unpredictable . my favorite part ingenious ? all players know when board full , game over . there end sight , just like lost cities , you play against yourself just much you play against your opponent . your strategies kill you , or leave you victor . spend too much time acquiring points one color , you might sacrifice your victory . try it , you won't regret it . i paid over $35 my local gaming store , it worth every dollar . game sturdy components , assure you playing it 10 years . 1 4 players . yes ! you even play this addictively fun game solo	1

" two hours later my wife read me other two reviews ... too late return product . anyway , valve stems , springs , rocker arms work terrific ... until they're assembled . then they barely move all . amazingly i able get spark plugs light .... after testing brand new batteries make sure they juice because silly lights would not turn . then i tested battery box ( i got voltage tester christmas now this wonderful opportunity learn how use it ) . tester , however , work advertised i discovered battery box functioned . i then pulled little motor out which miraculously worked when i placed it back into it brace ... hmmm ... go figure . now it time break out champaign . i turned out all lights fired up ignition . my 10 year old son still thinks it pretty cool even though he wasn't able assemble much anything . he manage open packaging without help though	-1

i bought this lego toy because we've several megablocks sets they fall apart over over again you build them . i hoped legos would better , but they're not . when built , fortress stands only 12 inches 12 inches , so scale small you can't really play it , given fact one wrong move sends whole thing crumbling . my son 7 experienced lego user , but even he said , " oh , man ! this bad megablocks . " this going end up our lego box spare parts , which sad considering we paid $39.99 it .	-1

i bought this bed my son when he 18 months old because he just would not sleep his crib . it take little elbow grease put together but not too bad . he slept it perfectly first night never fell out . i used mattress support his crib instead board ; there no boards my tru salesman suggested i use mattress support . i don't know why issue . my mattress fit perfectly there no gaps . this great toddler bed , however my son now three he constantly hitting sides night . i feel he no room move it . i am disappointed because i expecting get lots more use out it ! other reviews i read , this not seem common problem . perhaps my son just restless sleeper !!	1

this biggest wagon i could find . me it seemed best , it would fit three kids ( then 1 , 3 , 5 ) or two kids beachgear ( including shovels , chairs , food , parasol ) . good thing : it ! downside : it so big , it not easy handle kids sometimes even heavy adults (' big turn-circle ' ) . i would say : if you buy it transportation it ok , if you look wagon kids play : buy smaller version	1
my daughter loves riding her wagon . it also easy her grandparents take her around neighborhood around backyard	1

we got one these gift , couldn't get back panel batteries open . tried using small philips screwdriver , safety pin , etc ., it simply would not open . lack sound disappointing , though our child still liked pretty puzzle . we got battery-activated melissa doug toy also failure -- " vehicle sound block " toy supposed make sounds vehicles when blocks lined up correctly . we could get batteries , but toy simply didn't work . no sound , no nothin . ' this company seems well plain wood toys , but when they branch out into electronics , products fairly shoddy . i plan avoid their products future	1
i think we give them 5 stars . it true they very similar some other products out there , but they littlest pet shop toys which huge rage right now . pluses : keychain attachment seems pretty sturdy . i've it hooked my [ ... ] coat couple days now he hasn't pulled it apart . he doesn't " get " all pet combing stuff yet , but he really likes push buttons , watch screen hear music . great plus , volume very good level - loud enough hear , but not so loud drive mom nutzo . it seems like hamster monkey probably most rare - hard find around here . there tons dogs kitties available	1
this got worst toy we've ever bought . my four year old wanted it very badly christmas extremely disappointed when it didn't work . we let him dip marshmallows chocolate syrup then threw whole mess away . i think twice before spending my money this company again .	-1

our daughter received this christmas 2005 , we couldn't wait open it her . it very easy assemble , first time you write board it great . when you try erase your art , it won't erase ! magnetic board cheaply made , absolutely not completely erase , no matter how many times you swipe eraser bar . we very disappointed this item , would recommend if you considering this toy your child , you should pass . get them magna doodle instead , those work wonderfully	1
one my 4th graders gave me this game christmas play my 3-yr-old son . i bit apprehensive because i thought my son too young play this type game . boy , i wrong ! we play this every afternoon after school , several times weekend . some verb cards more difficult , but he learning we go what things how best " show " what they . i highly recommend this game plan buying several upcoming birthdays	1
we bought this game five years ago our then 3 yr old son . not only it his favorite game , but it now favorite game his little brother , who four . fact , he even plays it his imaginary friend ! game basically charades kids who can't read yet . it relatively non competitive . each turn , player spins spinner , advances number spaces colored spot board , draws card same color , then act out whatever picture card ( bird , flower ... ) . it great fun play your child -- hilarious what they come up " act out " their turn . ( imagine 3 yr old acting out refrigerator ! ) frequently we cheat look card while they acting , make sure we figure out what they doing . our whole family enjoys playing this little ones	1

anyone who seen these trains display bookstore or toy store probably realized their durability . they hold up , kids ( all ages ! ) love them , even parents too ! feature i like -- names written bottom ( my kids just couldn't believe i hadn't memorized trains ' names like they ! now i just lift train up ! ) . they cute , kids act out storylines books or movies , they going last long time -- most likely passed down next generation	1
my son big fan thomas tank engine friends . his favorite percy . he takes his percy trains him wherever he goes ( bed , car , around house , etc . ) . we even bought extra him just case he loses one them . if your children love thomas ( what toddler doesn't ? ) , i piece advice -- get duplicates trains . you never know if one get lost , or forgotten ! i got doubles most trains , percy included , it real lifesaver when one gets lost or left behind	1
our daughter loves play dress up . i bought these $5.00 clearance bought extra other little girls we know like dress up also . ours not smell ... but i know skunky smell some reviewers mentioned but happy meal toys mcdonalds . we getting lot enjoyment out ours ... no smells !!	1

game pretty good , but kid , competition basicly who could read faster . questions apear screen they don't read it out loud . i played my friends i thought i going great because i watch spongebob 24/7 but my friends beat me because they read faster answered question first .	1
my entire family loves this game . every answer actual clip episode , not dry text answer . eventually you start see repeat questions , but doesn't happen long while . game mechanics quite simple which fine -- fun answering questions anyway . we played this lot , kids usually beat grownups	1
we pleasure playing record 80's-90 some family friends . we played using teams try pool our knowledge . packaging graphics very well . it double-necked guitar game path covered 80's-90 images . you feel like you've gone back time . multiple choice format very helpful some our memories aren't what they used . one teams chose not use multiple choice answers their turns extra challenge . categories " 80 " , " 90 " , " mosh pit " , " you're stage " toughest ones , " one hit wonder " " real name " . we fun because game requires mix luck skill . questions range easy very difficult , so there something everybody . nobody felt left out ! we played three times night averaging 45-50 minutes per game ( alot singing air guitar thrown ) . our place rockin ' we can't wait play again . we highly recommend this game !!	1
my 3 1/2 month old son just starting smile , but he doesn't smile most toys . this changing table mobile main exception . he absolutely beams when he sees it dangling above his changing table , he used hate getting changed there . he even coos giggles lion . i would love bring it us everywhere ... lion must magical him ! plus , it doesn't need batteries ... yay !	1
i love this product . we bought it our 2 1/2 year old i looking way integrate academic learning into our daily routine . i didn't want make up alphabet cards or cut-out stencils hard time finding all-in-one , customizable product could help me teach her everything . when i found this , i overjoyed . it so much fun . desk comes my first leap pad , product well-reviewed its own right , great leap pad book many activities , playable piano keyboard interactive alphabet games deductive reasoning exercises . i sure book would lacking some way , sort built incentive buy more books ( this one those toys demands new cartridge/book accessory when your child gets bored ) , but this not so . all games endlessly re-playable played variety ways . this one book attempts comprehensive introduction system - it teaches math , reading , logic/reasoning , narrative structure , music , encourages creativity . even though i bought pack 6 extra different books e-bay , i haven't opened any yet . desk itself more than simple gimmick which store leap pad . it comes great set 4 shape-stamps , stamp pad paper stamp , full set traceable letter-stencils ( thick durable plastic ) , three different ' creativity sets ' let your child paint , marker draw while learning write letters numbers , recognize draw shapes ( among other things , i think ) . we only opened one so far , she loves it . alphabet creativity pack comes magic erase markers you use trace out letters color pictures illustrate use each letter . you erase re-trace forever onto little alphabet book , which great . i hate activity books single use because they not allow children practice same skill repeatedly . i also love this product looks so great kid room , furniture . it makes my kid feel extra-big her own desk ' work ' , makes it easier her pay attention games/activities than if we just sitting around . alternatively , leap pad itself entirely portable , taken played anywhere . if you cannot find this product ( look e-bay , that where i found mine ) , then purchase my first leap pad instead . however , this desk great value really enhances what leap pad itself . i highly recommend it .	1

i got this my 2 year old daughter christmas she loves it ! we're working her playing " rules " but we also made up other games it . she loves setting everything up " picnic blanket " . fun game toddlers	1
we got this my little sister who 6 christmas . she soo happy get one , so i because i forced share my ipod her car or any other time she spotted me using it . it comes two stories 6 songs . pros : volume !! my parents originally thought getting her ipod shuffle but after i pointed out she abuses volume control mine , ( turns it up too loud)getting her own wouldn't good idea . volume goes high enough car rides safe enough home use well . it doesn't seem eat up batteries either . we're just now replace them , but then again she forgets bring it car only uses it seperatly sold stereo speakers . it cute , it pink like mine it easy use kids who can't read yet . cons : softwear bit annoying . you only add songs either purchasing them their website or burning them off cd . this annoying because i couldn't tranfer songs her off my ipod hers without wasting cd . but it wasn't so bad , just annoying . we haven't bought any stories or songs off their site , probably won't . although stories great bedtime ( fp3 stereo)she doesn't care them much since she listens music i get her , she past age " i two cats " ( one songs included ) likes songs more upbeat songs like " brother sale " olsen twins . it alittle bulky . it not so easy her carry player her like i my ipod . headphone very bulky big compared player itself . so even if there time she remembered take it car , it wasn't something could easily tucked away . we're considering buying smaller headphones since volume control doesn't effect headset .	1
i got fp3 player my 5 year old granddaughter because i didn't want her left out able listen music ( her sister got ipod shuffle ) . she loves it ! headset perfect her , controls easy her manage understand . she listen same music her big sister ( age 10 ) . technology isn't only preteens or teenagers . kids smarter these days exposed more technology than ever . they see their parents , siblings , grandparents using computers , mobile phones , ipods , video games . they like cool stuff too ! they shouldn't left out . i only one suggestion . place clip back fp3 player kids clip their clothing instead hanging around their neck . it gets way when they dancing because it flops around !	1
this fp3 player great ! i deleted pre-programmed songs but kept stories . now my 3 year old daughter listen her favorite songs i don't worry whether volume too loud or if it damaged when she drops it . software could better - add songs you cd program copies it there but you can't move music files already your computer . i only added 12 songs approximately 3-4 minutes each but i think i could add almost 3x amount	1
we bought these keys our then 18 month old , when he obsessed keys set my car alarm off one too many times . toy great . key chain big so its easy kids hang onto , buttoms colorful appropriately sized , make honking noises , car starting noises , etc .. they keys metal like , not plastic , so toy feels more realistic . my now 3 year old still plays them still takes them places us . word warning , because these keys not plastic , very careful where your child puts them . we leaving store one day i handed my son his keys , grabbed mine while i putting my purse front seat my son keying up lock back door trying open it . yikes ! these keys scatch , so word warning .	1

we kind surprised see cooler wagon , but its functional saves us lug cooler separately beach , or haul it inside wagon . it big enough hold few bottled waters some ice , or least six pack cans . neat idea . it arrived quickly , all our radio flyer items , amazon padded heck out them when they shipped . none these items breakable , but we appreciate effort	1
this game great multigenerational way fun . we our parents ( 80 ) , our brothers sisters ( 40 50 ) kids ( 11-28 ) playing together . we make teams 3 age groups great time . younger kids really like playing adults all laughing interaction goes it . questions encompass many genres least one person each team know something aboutwe really recommend this ' family ' game !	1

these rings good concept , but weights them aren't heavy enough keep them place . kids swim through them they sort hop current ( kids swimming ) . when i child ... i set just like hula hoops length rope tied small case . case filled sand stayed put you swam through them . my friends i spent hours setting up courses we could race through . this set nice because it fold up fit small mesh bag transporting pool . but , if you your own pool you might want look set like i way back when .......	1

description clearly states size ( 3 inches ) these very detailed attractive collectibles . they're not really playthings , course , since they not articulated , it would nicer if figures series available individually instead pairs so one could buy players one wanted skip others .	1
this little cube perfect starting point anyone fascinated rubik cubes	1
i given fisher-price " doodle pro glow " my son birthday . although concept doodle pro glow unique , product itself fails live up its expectations . pens came our brand new doodle pro used didn't last more than couple days . screen extremely hard clean i resort using window cleaner remove gunk seems get caked . product comes " eraser " which no more than piece cheap dishwashing sponge disintegrates after few wipes ( not mention it doesn't get anything off first place ! ) . eraser shown packaging false advertisement since it not one you get product so fisher price should really change its advertising reflect true product . fisher price always brand i've trusted enjoyed so i very disappointed how shoddy this product . needless say , after couple days i took doodle pro glow my nearest toysrus full refund	-1
we got this bike my 2 1/2 year old it great . he peddle himself learn steer , or i push him make handles stay straight . handle pushed behind tall enough adult , yet if my son wants push , it goes down his size . i like size this xl , regular fold 2 go seemed too small my growing boy . best part if he doesn't want peddle , peddles don't move , so if you're pushing him , his feet don't go unless he wants peddle . overall , great bike learning toddler	1
this bike pretty lame . it would worth money buy one you steer when you control handle . it cheap so it best selling point .	1
my son almost [ ... ] - he loved bike but it took less then 1 weekend handle break off . i thought we just got bad sample so we requested replacement , it took less than 5 minutes this one break . so my son not bike i start looking one last 1 summer least .	-1
i bought this my 18 month old daughter . she loves it , but tendency tip it over when she tries ride it . it much more difficult steer keep upright than her other ride toys , but she learning ! if you nervous mom , wait until your child little older enjoy this , but it soooo cute she really loves compartment ( we call it trunk ) her put stuffed friend come ride	1
parents who judge education systems/software ability keep attention today add children regardless actual educational content may like this . they'll only ones though since there no educational content . " i love birthday parties , yeah " - " they're here , let party begin " - " oink oink " . this all we here these machines when we use them , which isn't often . kids click pictures elicit related often unrelated noises - it . there little actual phonics training . phonics " games " only ask one softball question per minute surrounded lot add attention getting fluff . these entertainment systems , not educational systems . we should note leapfrog brand dvds we not like leappads all . dvds very good . leappads worthless	-1
shiny chrome handle bars cannot tightened properly . result constant misalignment , consistent loosening front wheel assembly . " why my bike break into two pieces , daddy ? " wondered my three year old i tried picking-up bike handle bar	-1

good challenge my 8 year old put together ... not too difficult frustrating but hard enough make him think bit . he loves star wars so he spent good amount time playing toy after putting it together	1
lets start saying this item over-priced . miss weather very limited . how much better if there : least three pages , many outfits , backgrounds , objects . miss weather dress-up leaves little imagination . this item offers little .	-1
this toy fun ... but bit creepy side . also , it loses its appeal kind fast	1
my 2 year old grandson loves this toy . he plays it himself but much prefers me play him . it well worth money	1
i lot research before purchasing this computer . i read lot rave reviews , but greatly dissapointed ! first it great ( 1 week ) , then we problems , it would show upside down screen , we fixed , then we no keyboard , cd itself worked . i written twice customer service over span 7months i still haven't got response . i would call , but no number their website . go leapster instead , don't waste your money	-1
christmas , my mother bought this keyboard my son . he just few days shy if his first birthday . since he always fascinated mommy daddy their computers we all thought this would good idea . he absolutely fascinated first time we put this front him . i completely agree previous people software comes this basic . it completely age appropriate him since he 1 , but i couldn't imagine 6 months this software keeping him interested slightest . now though , it . we additional software well my only complaint ones overlay i physically tape them keyboard him play them . once he older shouldn't necessary but try explain logic overlay 1 year old not really option .	1
our daughter 16 months old she loves this . we got it because she saw us use computer wanted use ( bang ) computer too . note , you almost definitely want buy some add software go this . software comes keyboard intentionally quite simple . we got " my home " much longer varied animations . nice feature all software comes many different languages . so we could , example , switch it spanish mode help her learn spanish . we so happy this product we thinking buying up lot more their software titles .	1
first time we played this game , when initially going " contestant row " section , it put same prize up , oh , i don't know - maybe 13 out 20 times ? this one most blatant bugs you piece software . fact , i can't even go enough how horrible this - if i could get into negative numbers handing out stars i would . there testing team when this product developed , or they permanently out lunch , playing halo , or both ? would you like know how easy it write code won't show you same product 13 out 20 times when you return contestant row ? it looks something like this : randomizecall contestrow()function contestrow () prize_number = int((100 * rnd ) + 1 ) displayprize(prize_number)end functionfunction displayprize(number ) wscript . echo numberend function doesn't look so big task , it ? if you software developer . if i wrote code like people developed this game i would never sell anything due frequent requests my customers return their money , which leads me believe this product software development perhaps left hands director marketing effort cut costs ? or maybe it janitor ...	-1

what sold today stores colorforms bears little resemblance original colorforms set . original colorforms 5 large pages heavy-duty vinyl shapes spiral binder , each page different color . colorforms stick very well 2 boards included set , children ( adults ! ) spend hours transforming shapes into pictures . original colorforms set pricey but last lot longer than today colorforms ( which seem lose their stickiness after only few uses ) really sparks child imagination .	1

i say if i it over again , i never would let my son see fisher price catalog pick his christmas present . he saw shake go racetrack wanted it mater lightening mcqueen cars immediately . i am not so happy it because it takes lot keep race going . cars don't go more than 3-4 turns around race track before they shaken again then time race over , your wrist hurts . my son only 3 he doesn't know shake it enough so him , it just not fun . he likes it but easily gets discouraged it when he can't make cars go more than one lap , if . i would not recommend this 3-5 yr . olds . maybe older kids , but i wouldn't buy it again . i wish i could get my money back , but box all it wrappings went out christmas wrap trash . not waste your money	-1

my 3 year old daughter playing geotrax last 17 months . she loves them ! far her favorite toy . this city , even though it doesn't typical bells when train drives thru , still her favorite part . maybe it large size , maybe it all little cubby-holes her animals sit watch train go , maybe it crane turns ... she always include this piece when we build layout . we pretty large collection geotrax now - perhaps city better addition once you've already got many other pieces which more interactive train driving thru . only negative comment she ever crane doesn't go down far enough actually drop containers onto train cars . it only goes " middle floor " . i say geotrax extrememly educational toy . it very mathematical put tracks together . last few months , she building her own tracks completely her own . they very simple , but she doing it , it awesome !! we also work together build sometimes very complicated tracks . absolutely great toy great investment . all pieces thrown , dropped , she fallen them , literally not one thing broken .	1

after quickly destroying 4 cell phones dollar store , i bought two these cell phones younger 2 boys our 4 children . i wish i bought one each our children , ages 2-8 . phone allows you record play back short message . we've lots fun getting creative feature . also , 30 seconds after you close phone , it ring back . it makes phone seem more " real " . i originally didn't buy this phone our oldest two girls , ages 6 8 , because i thought maybe it too childish or too drab color them . but , they constantly playing these phones i trying find more locally , but unsuccessful so far . we added stickers personalize phones , so girls could make theirs more " girly " way . i've not seen any other toy cell phone nice this one	1
this third out four cartridges my son . aside freebie comes system , we also winnie pooh finding nemo . my son reallys seems enjoy bob builder , although he get easily confused it sometimes . it usually letters parts . i don't normally supervise him while playing ( how much trouble he get into video game ? ) but he invariably ends up calling me ask help letters sequences , usually things he should know himself . this his favorite , but also hardest one . finding nemo newer , so he hasn't tried all it yet .	1
my son just received this his birthday loves it . he plays it learning colors , patterns , lots other good things preschoolers need know review . definite must bob fan or boy who into tools .	1

this one needs work . we tried , annd tried make this microphone work , it -- minute time . when it falls out you keep starting over again . we returned it . too bad , it fantastic idea if it could only stay connected . our leadpad works fine other books , it just microphone top cartridge makes this invention top heavy so it won't stay	-1
i bought this my cousin daughter 2nd birthday . she seemed really like it . doll very soft , when you press rose her tummy , she lights up . she little bit baby powder scent , but i thought it nice , especially because it helps avoid " plastic " smell some dolls	1
my four-year-old loves her dora castle , magnetic " magic wand " accessories very slick	1
although it supposed three years up , i bought it my daughter first birthday . i figured we could fun it anyway . i couldn't more right . moment she saw it , she only wanted play horse . initially it started me putting her horse helping her rock , however within few months she climbing up down rocking her own . i am not sure if her climbing skills accelerated due horse , but she sure more daring than many her similarly aged friends	1
this game not quite what we expected . steering wheel only part needed . pedals looks . there 30 games all together . some driving games , some shooting games , some puzzle games , some activity games . you probably won't like all games , but there enough there you would probably find several favorites . graphics not like graphics you'd find current-day computer games ... more like tv plug play games made my younger years . my 6-year old loves it ! he very good controlling buttons , but he already experience playing computer games moving things arrow keys keyboard . i see kid who isn't used some difficulty using up/down/right/left button , particularly games where you control your movement precisely avoid falling , missing ball , or caught something . i trouble sometimes myself because it kind touchy button . not all games require you control button really well . my 4-year old really can't play any games well all ... he his reluctant even try . but he enjoy watching my 6 year old play games . i'm bit hooked some games myself ! adults tough time getting comfortable , however , since there not enough space seat steering wheel . i just sit behind straddle sit , putting seat my lap bit reach steering wheel . instructions games lacking quite bit . there 1 instruction sheet summarizes what object game specifies which buttons use game . however , instructions don't go into details game . example , " hero spud " , you collect keys bring them castle without hit pumpkin or bat . you learn-by-doing you make pumpkin disappear momentarily shooting it once . bats require 2 shots go away . example " tricky brick " ... ball ricochets off bunch bricks , you use paddle make it bounce back up hit more bricks without missing it . periocially , symbol floats out bricks . if you catch symbol , something happen , such your paddle get bigger or smaller , you'll get or lose life , ball go faster or slower , etc . instructions don't explain what symbols , so it takes while learn which symbols catch which avoid . despite its drawbacks , we very happy this toy	1
my children ( 36 ) o-o -o-o- o-o -o-o- o-o -o-ve this dvd all games / activities go it ! this their favorite story !! they actually share take turns controller ! this system great because controls simple enough 3-yr-old use ( sometimes he happy just turning page hearing story ) , games reading your own practice engaging enough 6-yr-old . if you read me dvd system , i highly recommend this dvd	1
this read me dvd helps kids letter recognition , matching lower upper case letters together ! it also emphasizes rhyming , which important pre-reading awareness . my daughters i found out chicka chicka boom boom blue clues , so when this showed up christmas morning , they so excited . my almost four-year-old daughter understood how use this toy only minimal instruction me . she watched dvd " read " book her , then she chose play games based book she just read . it very interactive , educational , mesmerizing entertaining . she play this 30 min-1 hour , asking me questions every now then . she likes she controls what happens , whether it just reading or playing games . she asks play this when she wants " big " kid . she thinks she playing video games , just like dad	1
when my son got this his first birthday i didn't think much it because it didn't seem interactive other toys - but six years later we still it number two loving it much number one . this toy outlasted all others - every kid who comes over loves it many their parents gone out purchased it because their kids so much fun it . this won't one those toys you spend lot money then find hidden back closet . it works wide range kids - first they love just banging hammer watching cars spin ; later it fun experiment steps catapult . watching stuff fly through air gave my kids hours fun	1
this great toy . i gave it my daughter 1 year age- too early . i put it away tried again when she almost two . it lots neat little things . bears played alone , or their cars , or play center . lots switches knobs things . she pound too hard play hammer shapes get hammered thru whole , fell down cut her lip , but i can't see how chicco fault . they really make great toys . their activity table ( not electronic one - one train , instead , award winner ) wonderful . this great break fisher price toys	1
my 6 month old loves this , but i very disappointed when i opened box , it lot smaller than i imagined looking picture , maybe they should show picture baby holding it so you see how small it	1
if your child likes playing thomas friends trains , james one main characters series . his 6 wheels not big gordon , yet not small thomas ' , but james just proud who he : red steam engine . he pulls tender full coal , so he won't run out fuel like diesels . james ' personality little snooty , he thinks his jobs most important . eventually , these thoughts land james trouble . rest assured , james always get his work , which why i recommend him your collection	1
my 2 year old son loves his james . he likes him best because bright red color . his thomas tank train set only toy he plays period he plays it everyday . other than thomas trains , he plays outside . when we guests , he takes them all play his train set . any first time buyer thomas trains you notice prices seem high toy this size but you remember these toys not plastic but made solid maple lifetime warranty . people asked me why i buy these trains when they most set not battery powered . reason because it my experience children get pretty bored just watching train go around track . thomas tank trains your little loved one gets actually participate moving trains . all trains different colors , numbers names which help promote memory skills recognition while fun . thomas tank engine books dvd teach lessons morals hard work , kindness , accepting responsibility , etc , etc , etc ...... your child ages they begin build their own track layouts so toy grows them . makers this series also included items series good people tighter budget . if your child likes trains but you can't buy full track set , you always buy play mat track printed them or you get thomas tank engine felt boards stick-ups . i hope this review helps !!!!!!	1
my daughter loves this few months now . she started playing just little crinkly toys 6 months , now 11 months she loves pulling buckets apart chewing tails . this toy great it teaches putting things out , soft , lots thinks chew , lots textures - overall great find	1

i really happy when i finally found them . we bought chicco flip'n'play earlier , which comes 14 great chicco blocks , all different shapes my 9 months old loved play them - we built all kind things together . i wanted enlarge our options ordered ( waited forever , which not part my product review ! but anyway ) these blocks , assuming they least some different sizes , allowing more creativity , but these 36 pieces only come 3 shapes - 2x2 blocks , 3 pieces 2x6 bridge shape 4 pieces 2x2 angle top ( roofs ) . so i am little disappointed . bag printed some different shapes . but unfortunately , they not there i couldn't find some extension sets other sizes	1
my husband i kind parents used think loud flashy light toys best . these blocks proved us wrong . my husband ordered these blocks last year christmas when he oversees among many other toys . she only nine months so she recieved them so she just held them chewed them . i would stack them her she blast knocking them down . we took them out again when she 1 . she now 17 months hasnt stopped playing them . they come plastic see through backpack storage so she loves put them take them out . she stacks them top each other high she then rolls over laughing after she knocks them down . all those expensive loud flashy toys still sitting there collecting toy dust .	1
i purchased this my son 8th birthday . he delighted . unfortunately excitement quickly faded when we discovered two crown gears not included box . i contacted company they quickly agreed mail these me . two weeks later , geers not arrived . when contacting company again , i told these air mailed day my original contact i would now need contact my " local dealer " . web site provided . unfortunately local dealer full days drive away . this resulted very disappointed boy little confidence company or their customer relations	-1
i surprised how big it , especially since it one smaller ones . but it nice . i'm glad i got my little girl real radio flyer . my daughter only 2 , it huge her , but she'll grow into it , her baby brother get plenty use out it too	1
he loves ducks , so he really enjoyed playing this toy . bal	1
our son started playing it when he 1 . my husband makes amazing things these . even my daughters play them while they otherwise not interested anything not " girlie " . great stuff . only thing it took us while find out superstructs . it used tinkertoys but it discontinued last year ( 2006 ) now sold superstructs .	1
my daughter got this christmas loves it . she takes pony everywhere her . she also loves give pony cup comb her hair . it great alternative baby doll	1
well , bitten strawberry shortcake bug over last few months ( hey , i'm geek . " this girls ' toy " thing doesn't apply name technology ) , my mouth foamed when i saw this item - " i definately mus it , technology sounds so cool " . however , like fisher-price laugh learn learning puppy , this toy wasn't available malaysia either ( fact , only toys i ever saw those little collectible dolls , few other plushes which i regretted not buying . nothing else . those disappeared late too ) . so , i swallowed my pride got it off ebay too . little under rm200 3 weeks later , doll arrived . now , i not saw any these review when i bought mine , but toy arrived fine , working pen all ( tried replacing battery ? ) . so , all systems go . time see this baby sing . my first complaint doll book activity states scan dots order hear entire song . perhaps they should've said " song replayed " instead , because certainly isn't whole song i hear ( watched " meet strawberry shortcake " heard songs their full , completed glory ) . i absolutely loved " friendship grows like flower " , dismayed when song wasn't played completion . neither " strawberry girl strawberry world " , a.k.a " jump clap turn around " . or other songs matter . maybe there some demo tab must removed . but there nothing it manual . box ? i foolishly thrown out box before i chance fully check it . ouch . thing one buttons first activity states scan find out " who baking delicious treat " . scanning it reveals phrase " delicious day " instead . angel cake gain nickname " delicious day " sometime ? other notes toy better . pen kinda interesting me , although activities offered kinda so-and-so , but pen ... well , it scans surface particular color . different color = different reaction . interesting technology . backpack keep pen when not use . ingenious prevents danger leaving pen cabling exposed . thing i've taken like doll " you're my berry best friend " music clip . although short , i actually liked it so much i devised method play song without scanning book all ( scan nearby good-luck bear plush clover activate mode , then carefully scan strawberry hat . any luck clip would start playing ) . other things ? well , book looks kinda sturdy ( my standard ) , pressing her right hand makes her talk , but you already knew . she says couple phrases which seems come random order , but that fine me . nutshell , it nice toy , although it doesn't sing entire song	1
all other reviews i very disappointed . pen attached doll not work book . doll keeps repeating " you play song me ? " my 4 year old daughter very fustrated doll . hardware 1980 not what shown box . i would not waste money this doll .	1
dress up clothes huge hit our home , however box they come way flimsy . i would suggest getting this product but purchasing different trunk hold clothes . trunk lasted less than day ripped apart .	1
these little pokemon figures beautifully made big hit goody bag item my son pokemon birthday party !! fact they came their own little plastic egg made them perfect goody bags extra enticing kids . if it up my son , he would loved keep them all	1
this toy great young child . it works great it really easy control	1
we bought this our son , excited his first remote control car ! however , after month playing it , gears became stripped it wouldn't work anymore . we very disappointed . intention this car wonderful , but when you actually get car , you realize how poorly crafted it . i would not recommend this toy anyone . when you spend money toys , especially toys decent toy manufacturers , you expect quality there . i am sure this tested over period time , so i am sure they knew this car not provide very high quality .	-1
i love dora castle we've lots fun ours . my only issues it dora ( fabric ) dress always falling off ( frustrating my daughter ! ) -- it should just painted or fitted better , this table . my daughter hard time it -- but i'm not sure if it would difficult across board other kids , or just her . so , we still love this , it very cute . one best things castle all sets -- you don't put all stickers yourself ! i've spent many birthday or christmas eve up all night sticking stickers getting angry when one ended up crooked -- so kudos fisher price doing hard work us	1
i bought these blocks my two preschool children 3 years ago . unit blocks wonderful way explore early math concepts because they related size . therefore they stack balance very well . this particular set long thin piece excellent creating bases roofs . this piece doesn't exist other sets i looked . only comment i they made rubber wood so they get little dents them . they not splinter or cause safety issue . enjoy !	1
good selection animals per groupings , wood edges smooth so these wont catch splinters . but magnets not strong enough . pieces fall out i shut each heavy wooden page . it also happens when my child doing so car . we lose quite few way . not great travel puzzle i hoped it would . my 2 yr old toddler loves adding her vocabulary after seeing these colorful animal pieces but its hard keep collection together	1
we puchased this toy our 9-month-old ended up returning it store . concept looks this toy great , but mentioned other reviews , this toy pretty noisy . it so noisy we afraid it could affect our daughter attention or hearing . toy not come volume control , music annoying some people like us . moreover , motor create force blow out balls runs so loud it ruins whole fun intention this toy .	1
we started out magnetix because brand readily available all major stores . my son played it lot i realized we needed more parts . i wasn't thrilled quality magnetix brand . small magnets came out sticks balls became dull very quickly . i $40 into it since most brands not compatible each other , i decide whether it practical start over new brand . after reading reviews i decided geomag . we got huge deal 660 piece set which no longer available . soon i opened set i realized magnetix junk threw them all away . if you serious building large set then forget magnetix . geomag only slightly more expensive , not enough worry . one important note my son plays balls sticks much more than plastic inserts . get some sets inserts , but build it mainly balls sticks .	1
we 2 inflatable convertible chair/sleeping bags our girls ages 5 7 ( 1 nemo 1 tinkerbell ) . we use them regularly . they light so girls move them around take them friends or relatives houses sleep-overs . tinkerbell bag easy inflate cover removable so you toss it into washing machine . it bit struggle get already inflated bag back into cover once it washed since it takes 5-10 minutes inflate bag we don't deflate it after each use . our girls twin beds so we slide inflated sleeping bag under bed until we need it . this storage spot also helps keep all sorts other toys " hiding " under little girls beds too ! most time they convert bed into chair leave it infated their rooms . our girls love play video games use their chairs all time - it great feature . they carry them down playroom or living room ( if i let them ) . even 5 year old convert it bed into chair 1 minute . we very pleased these inflatable chair beds but reason only 4 out 5 stars first tinkerbell bed bad seam would not inflate . we returned it without any problems company sent new replacement which worked fine . box you receive sleeping bag , inflatable bed , pump 1 time mini repair kit ( vinyl patch glue ) . if you plan buy inflatable sleeping bad , then purchase one like this convertible chair feature . it certainly worth it	1
once again , playmobile it ! i love their products . there lot detail imagination put into things they make my son ( almost 6 years old ) loves them ! we now entire pirate collection well few other sets . highly recommended kids handle keep up teeny tiny pieces	1
i've so far put away this toy except shark , i don't feel my four year old son ready all small pieces perhaps till his 5th birthday . shark excellent floats beautifully bath , unlike usual plastic fish sharks we . boat looks good , although i'm not sure i want see all those small pieces going bath . oars very unsteady , so i'm thinking little boat would go well bath itself , leave rest pieces table top play . very cute pirate , i'm sure seagull some words say him	1

this bubble machine great . my 4year old helps fill it , he turns it bubbles every where . even our two dogs get act . it great fun summer time	1
it fun while it lasted , but i hate how poorly toys put together these days . what happened well-constructed american toys ? one thing , it eats up way too many batteries . they should make it run 9v one instead . all those aas cost money ! then after couple months it just stopped working altogether . my husband tried open it up fix it could only get it running again wrapping whole thing up black electrical tape . everytime it stopped working my toddler son i jiggle it just right something connect right again . frustration , frustration . we give up ever getting one these again	-1

this product waste time ! don't bother . handheld game entertaining my daughter , but connecting it online via website frustrating say least ! once connected , we walked around " virtual world " nothing . it too complicated my 8 yr old alone . there much better products out there children similar , but easier play . i would suggest webkinz or neopets . these 2 sites very kid friendly educational games play , unlike muichiz site ! good luck ..	1
don't waste your time this thing until they fix bugs . we bought bratz one it thought it pawz when we took it online . after 10 or so total hours ( yes , i know what i'm doing ) fighting it i gave up took it back . tech support joke . there nothing manual or online help , only link tech support who sends exact same auto response every time , none those responses addresses issue .	-1

first all , stones fit into tube without problem - you only roll sacks up board instead trying fit them all top afterward . i can't compare board ' classic ' version , but i find this one durable convenient . pente become instant favorite , game designer myself , i greatly respect its elegance . if you've never played this game , try it ! rules incredibly simple yet game-play surprisingly rich deep ( much more than checkers but less than chess )	1
i purchased these clubs my son who juggles well balls wanted progress . his 19 took care when he tried use them but they fell apart after 2 months very little use . company completely unsympathetic i would recomend trying more expensive ones or different company	-1
while i am not chemist nor volcano expert , i am certified teacher . this kit provided hours hours quality time my 4 year old , my six year old myself . we measured ingredients , mixed solutions , made predictions , learned vocabulary , discussed results . you think many toys offer all ? i thought booklet contained instructions well-sequenced , simple experiments followed complex ones helpful parent script . there two drawbacks : activities required direct parent involvement sometimes 2 hour wait time required " reactions " happen	1

i'm avid rubik cube player 3x3 model owned my cube nearly two decades . since i solve it under 2 minutes , i decided invest 5x5 bigger challenge . unlike its robust sister ( my 3x3 cube well lubed vaseline , only one re-glued sticker ) , 5x5 proved fragile within first two days . i used careful touch , since i'm very familiar how untried cubes explode . nevertheless , many stickers started peel first day , two center squares completely falling off look non-reparable . i lubed my 5x5 before using it , though it more difficult because squares smaller turns tighter . i also careful turn rows precisely avoid misalignment subsequent explosion . even so , it broke me . it shame , because i really getting into challenge it . now , it just sits like broken toy my desk . $30 or so product , i find this inexcusable . rubik supposed strong brand name i very happy my 3x3 cube . i'll never invest rubik product	-1
my 3 year old daughter huge fan paz she really likes draw , so i figured this no brainer . she enjoy using it , but there some drawbacks . light projector not very bright . if you try use regular printer paper it hard see object illuminated . i haven't tried it yet , but i'm hoping tracing paper work better . other major drawback it collapses easily . order use it , you must lean two sections together . unfortunately they don't lock into each other , they just sort balance each other . so if you try move it or push it little too hard it collapse . even so , she loves draw markers , calling herself " artist " . chalkboard side hit too . overall i would suggest this toy	1

i bought this my 8 year old niece who loves playing school . christmas , it only gift she seemed really excited ! other reviewers said , it should include dry erase marker white board , but my only complaint . age range should also marked older kids . it very nice set	1
my 9 year old daughter this toy 2 years she still plays it regular basis . she her friends play school each other or even their animals . they also sell refill kit when you run out stickers paper . really great value kids who love pretend	1
fact almost all reviews children should tell parents one thing when considering this their child ... this fun it what your children want . imagine great " toy " also " educational tool " . parents children both happy this purchase . my child starting spanish fall ..... this must our household . actually i want fly too !!!! :-) p.s. great tool homeschooling family !!	1
my son ( 6 yrs old)loves these drum sticks . i love them because they off switch . great value your dollar . they noisey , but they drum sticks . no wires attaching sticks . they use batteries . they seem very durable . they also button change sound ex : cymbals button hear beat while you play .	1
rock beat rhythm sticks seem just fun anticipated . they work my children seem enjoy them . unfortunately , this company , music little people not provide good customer service . they sent incorrect item first . then when they contacted they wouldn't ship out correct item until they got first item back . mean time birthday party i ordered these toys come gone . i ordered these over four weeks ago just recieved them . if you want fun toy these might treat .	1
our 5 year old daughter loves it . very easy fun play . great buy	1
we received this game gift i not very happy it we try limit focus vanity our young daughters . said , game gets lot playing time . box says ages 5 up , however much younger children play , bottoming out 3 because choking hazared sized pieces . we change rules so you choose which direction go so game bit more than random spinner game . ( adds tiny bit strategy ) kids off refuse wear earrings because they pinch type ( course ) then just lay them front them . we used sharpies color numbers spinner because they hard see they gray gray	1
this table great . assembly pretty easy . it require you drill nails into plastic which little strange but not hard . table adjust angle kids draw more easily but so far i never put it setting him ( he little over 2 years old ) because it not easy they make it seem . when my son wants draw , there just no time mess setting . one more thing i want mention we table wood floor , bottom slippery wood floor so it slides all over place . so i put some non-skid padding feet make table stay place	1
we got this game when my daughter first grade . she some trouble her homework because worksheets made it difficult her tell difference some coins . she getting frustrated kept saying , " i don't get it . " this game helped her get more comfortable money , value money , counting money .	1
my kids their friends all adore this trampoline . it great indoors rainy days or evenings too . santa brought it christmas this year mom dad put it together . it chalenging job but we it together 45 min . i wouldn't want it myself because it difficult attach elastic cord . like other reviews , you make minor adjustment here there but it no biggie . our complaint whole thing just broke ! friend jumping it who weighs 70lbs . elastic cord pulled apart broke middle her jump . we looking contact info company hoping they replace cord maybe mesh kids jump . riveted holes may too sharp caused elastic cord break ? i gave this product 4 becasue over-all it great kids love it . i hope co . replace parts ! mom 3yr 5 yr old .	1
both my girls love this ( age 2 4 ) . i am getting tired music but they love it ! they spend lots time jumping this - only few mishaps when they jump too out control . handle great balance . when this arrived i put it together it larger than i expected . i able put it together myself . great product kids	1

my daughter 10 years old . she enjoys playing game . graphicsare very good such inexpensive game . i would suggest it anychild ages 4 up	1
these given my 2 1/2 year old gift i admit , first , i thought it rather dull gift . my daughter loves it , though . she uses cookies counting ( sometimes counts mms top ) . she also fun playing them her kitchen . she cooks cookies feeds them her stuffed animals . she counts how many cookies each doll gets . she spends lot time arranging cookies ( other foods ) cookie jar . it really great toy . we like lot learning resources products .	1

i'm not big fan pictionary . however , game , when played lot people good time - fairly fun . so when i heard squint , type pictionary clone , i wasn't too keen getting it . but i knew publisher , out box games , made some incredibly fun games , so i decided give squint try . so squint worth your time ? short answer if you need inexpensive filler , then yes . longer answer follows : first all , short description game play . squint comes 72 small square cards different simple shapes them . these shapes include lines , circles , curves , etc . these cards spread face up all over middle table . each player then takes turn . they draw " squint " card box roll die . die numbers 3 " 1 "' , 2 " 2 "' , 1 " 3 " it . die determines which word card player use , " 1 " easiest word , " 3 " hardest . small timer then flipped over , giving player 45 seconds get other players guess their word . they this arranging picture cards middle table into shape or picture . they may not give verbal clues , but may animate their picture or point part picture . if someone correctly shout out answer , they player making picture both get points indicated die . ( 1 point " 1 " , etc . ) if no one figures out picture before timer finishes , then no points awarded . next player then goes . whenever points awarded , small green chips ( tiddly wink style ) given out points . after each player gone specified number times , game ends person who highest amount points winner ! comments game : 1 ) . components : out box games produces some best components their games . this small game , but stuff inside top notch ! timer nicely colored , very sturdy . picture cards nice shape , quite thick durable . " squint " cards thinner , but only used minimally , so it doesn't matter . die clear numbers written it , easy see . box same size many ootb game boxes , very sturdy , easy fit shelf . all components fit superbly box . only components i wasn't pleased scoring chips . they very small ugly pea-green . they too easy lose , fall floor . i would preferred bigger , easier handle chips . but still , it doesn't really detract game much . 2 ) . rules : all ootb games , rules very short , very easy understand . they 3 pages laminated thick paper , easy read . back page i found quite helpful , it shows picture every picture card . not only this good inventory purposes , but it handy reference when you deciding exactly how build your picture . rules also offer several tips help include game play . 3 ) . ease play : it possible teach this game less than minute . most people familiar pictionary , comparisons evident . people differ picture cards . some ( like me ) like picture cards much better than drawing picture . others would rather draw picture than search through cards make picture predetermined shapes . it all matter personal taste . many " 3 " words also extremely difficult build picture cards . 4 ) . animation : little feature allows you animate your cards not only fun , but very useful ! example , when i make cannonball , show it shooting out cannon , it lot easier others guess it . this my personal favorite part game . 5 ) . playing area : we found this game actually plays very well floor . game name implies , it actually easier see pictures when you squint them . so , if pictures farther down , floor , it actually works better . 6 ) . fun factor : squint fun . we lot fun playing it , moving around picture cards , animating them . i think it price easiness play teach , many enjoy game . however , it lacks certain " zing " i've found other party games , like time up apples apples . people interested playing game when i suggest it , but they don't get excited they other games . squint fun , but not massively fun . however , i still recommend game . it good party game , it really quick play . when you short , fun game pull out , you wonderful little filler game . it not best filler i've played - but it quite functional fun . so try it out see if you like it ! tom vasel " real men play board games .	1
purchased our 3 yr old grandson , usual , you can't beat leap pad system both fun good learning toy	1
i purchased this bear my 3 year old grandson christmas . it absolutely best gift ! gavin listens his bear talk constantly . he loves music also . i read earlier review before my purchase bear not speaking clearly . bear speaks just clear anyone . it my opinion this bear great teaching toy fun also . if i could change one thing bear , it would make it more cuddly easier carry . gina westv	1
i bought this bear number stories my 3.5 year old . she wasn't thrilled it store , but she " issues " animated toys general . i found it amazon half price knew if she gave it chance she'd love it . i right . she likes her alone time i find her listening stories , interacting bear , singing songs her room . she follows books no trouble fitting tjs accessories into his hand her own	1
i bought this my daughter her 15th birthday . she huge elmo fan since we african-american i thought it cute little " black " girl doll love elmo much my daughter . it huge hit she loved it ..	1
this classic game still concept appeal , however cheap materials ruining effect . we played this game kids loads fun . bought it my 4yr old , found game more trying due cheap plastic ants . olden day ants made harder plastic yet still flexible pop . today ants thinner plastic bend more easily , making them get out shape normal pressure then they don't pop up , so game trying . you exert just right amount pressure pop ant not squash him . we tried several occasions different individuals , same results . however , appeal still there , so when my daughter(4 yrs ) who lighter hand makes score when no one else , it immediate delight . but even her lighter touch not sufficient get all ants without ants becoming distorted . i would say toymakers use little more umph plastic ants you'll easily revive classic game . other downfall dog suspenders not fix into box while assembled . so setup takedown required each game	-1
we purchased this my 2yr old 4yr old christmas before reading some reviews amazon . we paid $30 . after reading reviews , i nearly took it back , but figured we'd try it out return it if it seemed bad noted here . i very surprised find , contrary some reviewers , quality just fine . this set made plastic , but it only $35 ! it not most durable thing , kids definitely pull pieces apart . however , during normal use set works beautifully . my boys really enjoyed bowling , my two year old no problem learning how throw ball down alley . automatic ball return really cool , kids aren't dig into unit get ball out . it really encourages them stay right there wait ball get back . floor ( which one reviewer compared garbage bag ) much thicker than i expected . it definitely durable enough last sometime . overall , i'd say price this set well worth it . my boys get plenty entertainment out it . if you get similar deal , i'd go it , especially if you kids want bowl just like their older siblings	1
my son loves bowling . i no idea where he gets , since only time he actually bowling alley his sixth birthday this year -- long after he developed this craze . his favorite computer games " gutterball " " polar bowler " . he makes his own little pins plays tabletop games . i don't pretend understand it . so , when he asked this toy christmas , he weren't surprised . we hesitant buy it , however , because we afraid it would big disappointment . when he made his list santa , this only thing it . this all he talked weeks before holiday . we get it . i'm so glad we ! it great purchase . it easy put together use . sound effects big hit kids -- even our 5-month old loves watch us play . we use this toy reward ; " get ready bed quickly we'll time bowling ! " few complaints : pins pop off occassionally hard rolled ball . luckily they snapped right back . also , ball return fickle , but this probably result our uneven floors , though . this toy takes up quite bit floor space . it not feasible pack it up take it out when you want play . you really need leave it out if you expect it played . although there one-person setting , after initial newness wore off , my son didn't like play it alone . he prefers play it friend or parent . this presents small problem maximum number players play time two . however , there only six frames per game groups kids play " round robin " or " winner stays up " quite easily . bumpers , automatic pin setup ball return make this much fun than old sets we grew up ! we really enjoy this family game . i would recommend it ages 4-9 , older siblings parents fun well . definitely good purchase if you room	1
my 6-year-old daughter absolutely loves this toy ! so my 4-year-old nephew . just couple days , molly wore out first set batteries ; she played it all day ! one caution , though ; don't let controller get wet . my daughter inadvertently got it wet it dry out 24 hours before it would work again . overall , though , excellent toy	1
maestro hulk good figure . i like character am glad he marvel legends style . however , he too short . character 7 feet tall , but doesn't seem like it when you stand him up next bishop , iron fist , or anyone else past series . he same body sculpt used smart hulk back short-lived hulk classics series . so , if you stand him up other hulks , he look just fine . my opinion , if you're going make hulk-or anyone else-make him right size . figure great articulation excellent paint job . joints not too tight well concealed figure . details nice , too . his crown fits his head nicely , but fall off during play . you could secure it one those clear rubber bands come action figures these days . since he possible future hulk , he plenty little warts wrinkles all over his body show effects radiation battle his body endured over years . he comes copy last chapter 4-part captain marvel story . it real recent storyline older kids , so it few , inappropriate 4-letter words it-which i not approve . it sad testament comics these days they resort things like order make their characters plots seem real . they'll whatever it takes get them sell , i guess . i threw comic away keep my kids reading it . comic shows very little maestro hulk anyway . , it kind confusing just pick it up start reading last chapter . you really need preceding 3 comics get benefit story . i think they could picked better comic . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this way . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . maestro well stocked , so if you want him apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting great action figure who plays displays nicely . but , i only give it 4 stars because he too short inappropriate words comic . they forgot this toy recommended kids young 5 . i don't think most people want their 5 year old reading these kinds words yet .	1
this great product . my son 3 it works very well his motor skills . geo trax played each evening	1
i initially bought this toy work . playdough great fine motor activity used variety ways during therapy sessions kids all ages . course , it found it way into my 2 year olds hands she loves it ! rolling out dough pressing out shapes .. she could this hours . plunger little difficult use little hands , it may cause frustration if there not adult there help . little scissors also big hit great way teach scissor skills . bucket also keeps everything together . if playdough only gets put bucket not their little containers .. it still stays fresh	1
my two year old new fan dora , so i bought her this beach set stocking stuffer . say she loves it would understatement . we many dora toys now , but little dora boots figurines this set particularly loved . what nicest them they small enough her hold one hand , so very portable . they also hard molded plastic , so while they aren't poseable , they also aren't breakable extremely easy clean . she bring them bathtub , bed , play them meals sandbox . i wash them super hot soapy water unlike stuffed toys we own . paint held up well wear . i ended up buying one these sets backup , case one gets lost , different set get tico character	1
i like this pool floatie lot . only thing annoyed me this purchase thru amazon , it doesn't tell you there several different patterns it comes . it only mentioned blue dolphin pattern . i bought this my son we got green one flowers it . quite disappointing	1
i don't consider this toy . it just what i need 1 yr old pool . i using baby carrier . this great	1
this toy absolute junk . purchased 2 boys christmas . one quit working day . amazon amazing replaced it quickly .. but only one side works again . second one drains battery . even tried new battery charger . still drains it matter minutes . it great concept , but not durable all . gears turn " shells " go out quickly . then you left useless toy . tyco should little more product testing before this one put out .	-1

my 6 year old loved it . many games it not enough learning materia	1
like many others , my 3 year old daughter received this christmas . she received castle packaged w/3 bonus ponies . castle feels solid easy her open close . she likes option using wand open castle or pushing button above doors instead . she enjoys putting her ponies or other toys it . i also like she close up many her ponies it evening everything confined into one little space . she even carry it one room way . problems : there really isn't room play castle few small accessories it comes , some accessories very small , magnet dance floor little difficult manuever . none these issues bother my daughter , though . she loves castle , which makes it money well spent	1
castle cheaply made comes so few accesories worthy mention without types accessories would make it something fun play . my daughter hardly even played hers , exception opening closing castle just hear sound ! she also noticed her own apecial " wand " used open castle not like one adverstisement .... " mommy , there no crystal my wand , look ! " also , dance floor so weak it nearly impossible my 5 year old even manuever . definite disappointment $	1
this toy really cool . my 3 1/2 year old daughter got it her pap-pap christmas . only reason i'm not giving it full 5 stars price , $59.95 +tx , it should totally come dinner table , like picture , or free pony . i also wish you didn't push purple platforms top level before closing thing up tight . if you try close it purple platforms protruding , you could break purple platforms . wand idea make it open up into castle excellent concept . my daughter loves her castle . it really really cute . just wish it came more price	1
list price almost $30 . it sale $9.99 amazon . my 5 year old chose this toy online she likes i t.t he crown jewel stickers pretty , but hairclips don't really work . when she runs curling iron through hair nothing happens , because water isn't cold enough turn it pink . ice cubes too big fit curling iron , so i just set cup ice water her dip brush into .	1
my 5 uear old loved it , so her 11 year old sister though she hates admit it . great value fun least hour . it cute accessories shared	1
previously stated , colors not quite right . also , my son wore it only fifteen minuets when we noticed stitching comming apart down back seam . he should least gotten whole halloween worth out it	1
talk your off wall questions you always wondered upon but just never knew answers too twist some question you clue too . it funny hear what people make up spur moment almost scary hear people you know lie so well you believe their very answer if it given fact . its also extremely impressive when you or someone actually knows answer . i played this game group people ranging 41 14 , we all enjoyed it . first time we played we teams , so dont stop up six players , its still just fun group , but diffidently more fun individual . there few times one member group would draw blank even begin answer , first time this happen , player answer " its government conspiracy . " which became running gag when anyone ever drew blank bluff answer . malarky begins question , only one person room correct answer , you dont know whom it till after round ended . you go around table everyone bluffs their way through it correct answer . than all players guess afterwards whom spoke rightful answer ..... than truth comes known who able lie through their teeth ... ha ! points won guessing rightful answer . fun , laugh little , always make time play	1
this game awesome ! i played it some friends now i've looking it everywhere .... i found it here ! it so much fun play . not only you learn your friends actually know weird stuff , you learn weird stuff too !!!!	1
my 11 month old son received this christmas he loves it . he loves watch animals pop up make noises . it fun watch his face light up hear him squeel delight when he hits one buttons animal pops up	1
this one my son favorite toys if not his favorite 5 mos now . when i bought this him he didnt know how pop up bobble heads but didnt matter him because once i showed him how open it he fascinated those little heads . he quickly mastered closing each one . music suprisingly also activated when you hit bobble head well hitting knobs/buttons so he could still enjoy it even if he still learning open it . out all money spent toys this 14.99 toy surpassed my expectations still played every day , several times day	1
who would thought this would hit christmas . lots fun all ages 6 , 8 , 10 , 43 . tons competition lots ways make it more challenging . after two days playing it non-stop , my husband says , " i haven't lost yet ! " i looked 6 , 8 , 10 year old said , " super , honey ! " great game , lots fun	1
i truly enjoy playing this game my 5 year old . she greatly improved her reasoning skills while playing this game asking yes or no questions their physical appearance deduce character my card . it helps her observation skills , it also exposed her pictures people differing ethnicity . allowed us conversation helped me teach her how properly politely describe their appearance , potentially avoiding embarassing episodes down road . you never know what child age say where they say it , so it unexpected benefit this game it lead conversation	1
i got this game my son who just completed kindergarten , begged it . i thought it bit beyond him , he just learned read write this past school year , but he rapidly learning recognize differentiate correct incorrect words , he loves it . i guess lure spiderman makes even spelling fun , reading same story over over .	1

they exactly how they described . my granddaughter who close four years old really enjoys using her imagination them . they small enough her carry her " purse " or play them car . i am very pleased my purchase	1
ours never worked . we turn button , giggle , then nothing . little fairy doesn't really play environment much - there not lot it . i'm not sure why this so expensive since it doesn't much but sit there . only thing my daughter found it lose detachable fake leaves . i can't get spokes top stay it either . far , worst toy purchase i've ever made	-1
i almost didn't buy this cotton candy maker because poor reviews but our unit works like dream ! we plugged our unit after pulling it out box , pushed toggle switch , waiting 10 minutes motor warm up , poured teaspoon table sugar into spinner within 30 seconds we cotton candy ! consistancy little heavier than professionally spun cotton candy you'd get fair but i didn't expect much better . spinner shield helps contain mess but you'll still little sugar crystals jump out bowl , i one pop up my eye while we figuring out process . we accidently added sugar before we supposed but it still turned out , so it pretty much fool proof create perfect cotton candy . there some sugar crystals finished cotton candy but not huge amount , it didn't detract magical fluffy candy . my kids sure didn't care , they pulling small handfuls out constantly . machine ran 15 minutes repeated batches made back back . we shut machine off because we'd our fill our sugar high we afraid ask too much this wonder machine . i'd buy this machine again sure know we'll get more than our money out it . we ended up star performing machine first time , unlike other reviewers who tried repeated units find one worked it should . recommended !	1
it great price great find . i love it , i completed my disney cars collection thanks amazon !!	1
i got this my son four year old birthday . he hasn't stopped playing it yet ! he loves it . box little misleading because it says set includes " articulated diego " . i thought it meant diego character included talked . no , computer attached rescue center talks diego voice . not big deal . it great way him express his creative play . little sister sees it dollhouse ..	1

my husband i gave this ( radio flyer wagon ) our almost two-year old grandson christmas this year . his parents probably appreciated pad more than wagon since they don't scramble blankets , ect . when taking him wagon ride . it perfect fit wagon seems very durable .	1
we bought this item our daughter birthday because she loves schoolhouse rock . after opening it playing we discovered it just songs one game ? when you read what offered it says " games " , we only found one whole thing , guess we misunderstood whole principal cartridge . i ended up returning it because if i wanted her watch videos i would buy schoolhouse rock dvd , which we . anyway , thought we should share this because when you read it you expect games songs ?	-1
i think this toy made kids just fun making fun deluxe clothing their chou chou doll aka dolls pretend real people who think thiese dolls real	1
i bought this my little one when she 3 months old help encourage her during tummy time . i wasn't all impressed it after i gotten it out packaging . thing always falls over pull string makes music start mouse go around difficult pull , particularly little hands . now i've attached it side crib she seems like it better . definitely not worth money	1
this best playhut toy .. no poles just flip open fun .. my one year old my 10 month old love this bus ..	1
it great , my kids ( 1 almost 3 ) love it , we took it grandma grandpa ( because it folds absolutely flat takes up no space car ) everyone played bus . it perfect birthday present my nephew ( 5)(because he so much fun it grandma grandpa . ) i continue amazed imagination my kids all places bus goes . yes , it could probably sturdier , but it not ripped or torn . i still wonder , mentioned one review , why we got 2 steering wheels extra toggels exit door back .	1
what great this tunnel you remove segments use it any way you like . right now i removed one segments it attached my daughter playhut , other 2 segments i together single tunnel . material very well made i am confident last until my 5 month old begins play it . my 2 year old loves crawl through this tunnel	1
my daughter got this her 4th birthday , she loves play dolls , especially hair practically learn how cornrow because it . i like it accessories her well . doll closer her skin complexion more realistic her . girls spend lot time dolls i don't want her develop any complexes . i wish there some kind storage unit base head keep track accessories	1
battery received no packing slip , plastic housing onthe battery cracked . my husband fixed battery ( blue plastichousing ) but i feel it should not delivered condition , no " packing slip "	1
our battery quit recharging after year . it very dissappointing charge battery hours then tell your little one it didn't work . it difficult find battery . i thought fisher price 12-volt would work but it not connect . apparently , you buy this brand , which , by-the-way , cost third cost our tractor ! what you ?	-1
this perfect first remote . we got it my son who 2 1/2 yrs old . i think he bit young , probably more suited 3 year old . we great fun it , however . rest our family use it chase twins around they love it . it pretty resilient too . we only one hub cap pop off ( now , isn't realistic ?! ) it easily poped back . it pretty easy batteries too .	1
my son received busy beads pal his 1st birthday , unfortunately 12 months this toy just fails grab his attention . suggested age range 6-18 months so maybe if he got it 6 months it might more interesting him . this stage he more interested sorting things , like blocks etc or colorful sing toys	1
my son always fan blue clues so this natural choice ! not only my 3 1/2 year old son v-smile all figured out - without slightest assistance me or his mom , but he mastered blue clues game plays it constantly . it instant hit !	1
thought price + free shipping one those " too good true " deals , but went against my better judgement ordered it anyways . glad i . sturdy table nice set trains/tracks , but you tell original thomas/brio tracks/pieces better quality ( 4 times price ) . there quite few scratches wood pieces one glued pieces storage box wrong place so i pry it off reglue it order " walls " fit place . also piece table glued piece fell off so i re-glue one too . under product features , it says " rolling storage trundle under table " . there no wheels storage box . playboards 2 holes ( 2 inches diameter ) . i suppose it make it easier pull boards up , but i covered them up because edge risers kept falling holes . all all , good value my 2 year old loves it ... which trumps everything i said above .	1

my 3 year old daughter recieved variety color wonder products gift christmas . we hooked since . we recently lots problem keeping it all paper . since we recieved color wonder it not problem all . they not make any mess outside paper . we tried markers finger paints . i would suggest this product any one small children . they great	1
we purchased this our son christmas so far it hit . he developmental delays so i am always lookout sturdy educational toys him . he loves stack blocks other objects but becomes very frustrated when they fall- this pegboard , pieces fit together so when my son stacks them- they unlikely fall . my 3.5 old also enjoys sorting them color or shape . all around , it nice toy	1
it great skills puzzle ! however , it doesn't fit puzzle holder made same company . all our others this one sits tops . . . rather unfortunate	1
this beautifully made puzzle good challenge 2 year olds . under each piece there picture inside object ( what backpack , what under shirt , etc . ) which extra fun . buttons , laces , zipper large enough little hands . it take some time little ones get hang completing tasks , but it time well spent they'll feel great once they it . wonderful those who beginning want dress themselves ( " i'll it myself ! " they say , right ? ) now , they way practice those skills so they feel successful . highly recommend this	1
i bought this set my 4 year old nephew . my main concern he would get bored it concidering loud flashy toys out there ... but this one stole show . even his 7 year old sister fun playing it . great toy	1
our four-year-old daughter wants horse farm more than anything else christmas . all she talks how santa bring her horse farm . she sooooooooo excited it . we selected breyer paddock pals glamour girls ranch because it looked beautiful picture , because breyer solid reputation building quality toys . tell truth , we excited receive it ourselves . it arrived today , so we decided open box set up farm . that when disappointment struck us . this not standard north pole quality product . simply put , quality this ranch terrible . we able get farm assembled , true pictures web , it look nice . however , getting it point act frustration tested our patience resolve . then , playing it matter entirely . other reviewer commented , windows doors not remain barn all . slightest touch knocks window shutters doors off structure . some doors not want open all without popping off . one door actually not fit . fence ? let just say it wouldn't hold any horses i know - prtend or otherwise . we joked this barn reminds us one those satirical " some assembly required " christmas toys takes forever put together , then falls apart soon someone moves . barn itself " feels " flimsy . it almost feels brittle - it thin brittle plastic . it very cheap ! it doesn't close together evenly or easily . it " snaps " it closes instead smooth motion we expec t.t he horse , girl , stable accessories supplied barn fine , but they aren't anything special . we plan send it back . doing so , we now face daunting dilemma ... we now three days find suitable farm would meet our expectations , more importantly , our daughters ' expectations . obviously , we not recommend this product .	-1
i bought this because kid my grandparents one i would play constantly everytime i visited , age 7 certain i could solve it . i never , eventually it broke , it wasn't until i sitting my work waiting my computer something , i thought i needed something while i waited my computer unfreeze , or network come back online . so i bought rubiks cube , figured it good portable puzzle thats easy store , only one piece . it came display stand , so i keep it displayed next my monitor , co-workers come scramble it hoping i won't able put it back , but i always . like i said its puzzle , but not alot pieces , its portable , so if your taking bus home , you kill time it , then put it back your briefcase , or backpack . i love it haven't gotten sick it yet	1

my family adore peek blocks . nesting blocks latest long line incredible toys , so our expectations quite high . while these toys constructed well , they not , my opinion , peek blocks because they not closed blocks . charm peek blocks you get peek inside sealed blocks . these not sealed blocks . good , but not par other peek block set	1

first magic set my 5 year old , he loves it !! he his friends created magic acts each other laughed all way . tricks easy enough their age try , remember how . directions come pictures , so they figure them out if wording too comlplicated . set itself durable enough fot most tricks over over . blocks take some reshaping rabbit ring trick not really fit right , but overall , good first set . it definately hit rainy sunday !	1
very fun entertaining . our friend son got this birthday present all kids wanted play it . i'll getting one these my kids , x-mas . they'll love it !	1
i needed lightsaber halloween this year . it too late mail order one , so i went mall see who carried them , what they looked like , how they worked . looking anakin ( blue blade ) or mace windu ( purple blade ) models , but only able find darth maul ( red blade ) , darth vader ( red blade ) , luke skywalker ( green blade ) models . fluorescent lighting stores , vader maul blades not very bright actually rather pink looking . green blade luke saber much brighter comparison . volume sound effects seemed louder luke model well . i attribute superior brightness loudness luke model fact it takes 6 aa batteries , rather than 3 like other two models i played . maul also some plastic handle up near blade , which turned me off . luke model all aluminum , turned machined , no plastic except on-off switch . there nice chromed steel belt hook folds handle , but sword so long i doubt you use it actually hang it your belt ( it shame blade isn't removable ) . all electronics triangular cross-sectional plastic carrier batteries , which just slides out when you unscrew end . on-off switch works well , doesn't accidentally turn or off when you don't want it . my main quibble diameter handle near blade : due batteries such it can't fully choke down like real movie prop , section it painted orange rather than brass color , but you can't everything . pictures web obi-wan ( blue blade ) looks very authentic , but it only takes 3 aa batteries , so it might not bright or loud . all models you see electrical " sections " leds blade turned off - they maybe 4 inches long or so each . but scroll pretty fast , so chunkyness isn't too distracting . swoosh sound effect varies sensitivity : sometimes moving handle just little kicks it off , other times swinging it won't produce sound till you stop - but it isn't too bad really . sounds themselves authentic - bit tinny , you might expect small speaker , but well . one three clash sounds played ( choice seems random ) when blade sharply struck ( takes bit too much impact trigger it imo , i worry breaking it ) . like everyone , i wish blade could somehow retract , but it beats me how you could build something would work this well also retract , so it trade-off . overall , i'm happy i able find luke model don't any regrets	1
i got this uniqua doll compliment my niece birthaday some backyardigan dvds . price i pay excellent toy . it small but baby girl doesn't matter !!	1
i ordered 4 cuddle chimps my grandaughters christmas . they arrived few days though we wait until christmas real review i tell you they cute , cuddley love	1
i purchased several furreal toys 3 large , 2 small . they so realistic they always hit christmas -or birthday . however , all three larger toys , one arm doesn't work ' quite ' right due children picking them up kids pick them up ( arm ) . i noticed reviewer mentioned this well . kids fans these particular animals ( bear , koala chimp)and they still love them which why i still buy them ! i able take advantage sales but i don't think reg . $30 price tag necessary .	1
i bought this game my four year old who loves early reader i spy books . i wasn't sure if it something my nine year old might interested playing since he often bored playing games my four old plays . we decided play this game our sunday family game night it huge hit . i very suprised see how much fun my husband game ( he hard please ) . i admit i great time playing well . game play : everyone gets eye spy board takes turns flipping over deck cards . each card there picture each game board . everyone must find which picture they their individual board must ring bell ( included ) when they . fun part everyone continues find their objects yell second , third . each position there points ex . 1st person find object yells first gets 4 points , second gets 3 points etc ., family decides number they reach determine end game . us 30 perfect . we laughed alot during game , especially because my daughter who i afraid might not find many objects quicker than my husband i . it challenging fun , good addition family game collection .	1

i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search !	1

those you who new yu-gi-oh tcg , i suggest you start starter ( naturally ! ) , but you'll want get this other structure decks eventually . not only they contain many what we call " staple , " or standard , cards -- which found nearly every deck due their sheer unbridled power -- they built tough ready duel cards work one -- not so starters . unless you're experienced , however , you won't know how use ' em , so start starters . this particular starter deck , " blaze destruction " starter , comes some deadly combos . backfire burns your opponent 500 damage every time he kills off one your flaming beasts ; solar flare dragon burns ' em 500 every turn can't attacked if pyro-type play your side field ; ultimate baseball kid gains 1000 points every pyro-type your side field , possible 4000 points ; infernal flame emperor potential blast every spell or trap your opponent play right into next week upon his very dramatic entrance . really see destructive power this deck possesses , buy one try it out . it good place start if you want get into tournament play -- you won't win any regionals it , granted , but it good place start nonetheless . also check out it brother deck , " fury deep .	-1

i actually bought this expansion kit toysrus , but buy playzone itself amazon , since toysrus discontinuing it , it hard find this product local target stores . this kit great , makes big difference area covered playzone	1
compare shipping rates . you may find it cheaper buy two complete playzone kits rather than buying one playzone several extension kits . i highly recommend combining two playzones so mom dad play their toddler inside . smaller play zones ( any manufacturer ) simply cage-like feel them . i am * guessing * teddy bear sticker not included playzones any longer because they could peeled off , or partially pulled off , just cause problems . i really prefer playzone teddy silhouettes instead stickers	1
my 4 yr . old received this christmas we love it ! it stores easily under his bed . it great play doh ( contains mess nicely keeps play doh smell off our other tables ! ) comes lots cool tools , molds , etc . we put it floor i play play doh both my kids same time . however we also use table so many other activities like paint water books ( those stain easily so it great using surface we don't care staining ) , coloring , more . sometimes i pull it out my 4 yr . old 2 yr . old color table same time . there lots great spots around table keeping crayons pencils rolling away . we small house , so this fabulous toy creating work /play space our kids .	1
great product , play easy everything together you don't search , clean up breeze all you put things back desk pop top back . my 2 1 year old love i	1
this great set ! my son got this his 3rd birthday he his 6 year old sister enjoy it tremendously . they both play together since there so many things . set comes bunch play doh , cutters , stampers , plastic scissors little knife cut play doh . funnest part table top little molds make all sorts fun stuff . it also includes some crayons paper , but i am not really sure why ; they seem out place set . neatest thing this set when they , they use little tool pick up loose play doh pieces put all parts doh back into storage case very easily . this would great any child enjoys play doh , it so many features there fun anyone , more than one child play time . it also lot more space if you want expand buy other play doh toys store them box .	1
it fun because you your own icecream like mcdonald pakage contains mc furry maker , 2 springs mix , 2 flavors , 1 spoon , one cup . only things you need cream , ice , salt , water . i recommend these toy very fun	1
i read some reviews here i think other people just didnt read directions properly . my 3 year old son i make mcflurry all time our machine we love it ! it easy use easy clean-up . we never mess when using this we never gotten water everywhere . also , entire thing plastic able put water so clean-up super easy . this no more difficult than cleaning blender after use . i dont know why there so many negative reviews this- we havent any complaints all . also , you use 3/4 cup cream 1/4 cup mix so i would assume make 1 cup ice cream , which i feel plenty child eat . it not fill up cup entirely but if issue you , i would suggest either you use smaller cup or make 2 packages . super easy use . super easy clean . very yummy . it reminded me ice-cream maker we when i kid . remember kind , you put ice salt then turn crank like 30 minutes . maybe other people arent familiar ice-cream making process but this just like only smaller faster . my opinion , 4 6 minutes not long wait this yummy treat	1
this game fun way introduce geography . manufacture recommends this game 3 up , while amazon states 6 - 9 . our home it enjoy children ages 4 -adult . older children adults get tired bit faster than preschool younger school age children . it easier play game child who read - but even those limited or no read skills fun . game bright colorful . it captures your attention imagination . this game teaches good basic map skills . players state names countries looking them . if they don't know them , they quickly learn recognize them .	1
game rated 8 years above . it would quite impossible most 3-5 year olds play , since reading required . i believe there error amazon age rating . however , my 7 year old i enjoy playing . , after my daughter brought it her 1st grade class , her school teacher asked where she could purchase game , because it fun educational	1
this highest quality play money i've seen . bills more durable than most coins made dense plastic . realism very good educational purposes . my 7 yr . old gets lot use out it	1
i bought this my son when he few months turning 3 . he absolutely fell love . even his older sisters ( 9 7 ) joined fun . it allows children use their creativity imagination . all plastic pieces high quality last . only thing you'll eventually replace play doh once it through enough .	1
i love little people toys their durability their ability keep babies/toddler interested . my twin boys just got this their second birthday they play it all time . they love animals all sounds . they figured out how make farmhouse play all sounds now starting get interested which sound goes which area . i love it educational teach them thigns they need know hit milestones they haven't achieved yet . fun toy	1
this last little people set i purchased my toddler son . he most other " big " sets , didn't this one , so i read reviews decided buy . i say i am little disappointed my version not scarecrow or catapulting bed :( however , i find my son enjoys this toy . he loves place animals their " homes " hear noises they make . he enjoys piling all animals , including farmer , into horse cow stall . cute ! what you get : 1 barn1 farmer1 farmer cart1 horse1 cow1 lamb1 pig1 chicken1 removable rooster top barnfeatures : sounds everywhere ! there sounds each animal wherever animal " home " located ... ie . if you put pig pigpen press lightly , it oink you . course , it also oink if you place horse there , or any other animal , but i figure it great way teach children proper sound each animal makes . farmer bed also makes snoring noise when he sleeping , or rooster call when it time him wake up . there workbench makes sawing noise or hammering noise when pressed also . there merry-go-round front barn produces few songs such " farmer dell " or " old macdonald " when turned . overall , this great little barn , but i'm writing fisher-price tell them they should taken away scarecrow or bed feature because it obviously great feature !	1
we received this christmas gift my daughter when she almost two . we lots fun playing it together , she loves play it her own . however , if it batteries it she just compulsively presses buttons . we took batteries out we see real imaginative play .	1
i am not really complaining but add heading indicated i would receive more than 1 shovel . shovel big sturdy but no " sandbox toy " beside shovel box .	1
my son received this blaster treat he so excited play it . sounds lights terrific ( they're even better when played different room ! ) . i would definitely buy this again	1
i purchased this table chairs my 3 year old twins . just other day some reason one chairs upside down i noticed little plastic plug unscrews comes out . well , i found out chairs filled little sand so way they not tip over anymore . my twins both falling off chairs everytime they would go get them , but now sand holding chair down they little more stable . i hope this helps everyone this set . i am pretty happy this table now	1
purchased this our almost seven year old neice . she one doggy fur real loves it . polar bear makes less motor noises , which good . switch little hard reach , but also means it very well-hidden . child-size fingers get it better than adult-size fingers . some trouble getting it hug function . it think it supposed stretch out its arms ( which it ) then close them into hug ( which it didn't ) . our neice better this stuff than me , so maybe she got it work . everything else -tickling laugh , eating , burp , hunger grunts snoring worked fine . very cute . just remember turn these guys off when you're . otherwise they go into sleep mode , but batteries still gradually drained	1
hi . i'm nine years old i got this toy my birthday . i think it alot fun play . i would recommend this toy all kids who like interactive toys , because it lots neat things . however you should not get fur real friends any young kids . i 5 fur real friends i like collect them	1
this doll great dissapointment . once you take it out box , you find out doll body oddly shaped . half legs fabric , main body too heavy its extremities - doll cannot stand or sit . mine not recognize its cup , it supposed , it really grows too fast into toddler . most times it not respond when you give commands . also it not cute picture . i would not recommend this doll anybody	-1
i love suzie . she best doll i've ever !! suzie comes loads acssesories ! i use them every day ! when i change her diaper i feel like real mom !! she needs lots care love . i tell her my deepest darkest secrets she doesn't tell anyone , not even my best friend !! suzie talks me she plays funnest games me ! i bring her my best friends house she plays suzie much she , my friend wants her really bad ! when she drinks her bottle she makes cute noises ! long you don't press her buttons she absoulutly perfect ! i think everyone should get her ! i love suzie , she part my family !	1

my grandson lego fanatic . correct , starwars lego fanatic . he puts these things together faster than you open box . he loved this one . especially since you make wings move up down finished product so realistic . this came ontime , even though it said it may take longer , great gift	1
this set worth every penny !! if you someone who likes collecting characters , buy this !!! i don't recommend this set kids under 8 years old because this set takes around 38 minutesto make medium difficulty build . other than ... this set off da hook baby !!!	1
this great blaine doll your barbie collection . he much better than cali guy blaines . only bad thing him straight arm body . but i fixed prob swapping his body bent arm ken . now he more posable . add this doll collection today	1

i think it very creative young children . i got it my 5 year old grandchild who wanted it but i think she bit too old fit right vanity but it great each time they take out tool it talks what it used	1
our 4 year old daughter this christmas . so we bought it . it very easy put together . instructions very clear . it only took me 30 minutes or less put together . most time spent looking piece i dropped it rolled away . we also bought accessory set . which adds even more fun vanity . my daughter loves style her hair everybody else who walks into our house . she loves make ariel appear mirrow . only downside i see , they should used ariels voice " little mermaid " . i think my daughter looking forward , but instead we got different voice all together .	1
i bought this toy christmas gift my 18 months old boy based reviews posted other parents . what great toy this ! i pound ball delivered my work immediately opened it . it lot fun play ( even my co-workers played ) . balls little hard pound through first , but after trying couple times , balls went through fine . even my son able pound them no problem . i only wish there extra balls available purchase ( my son already lost two ) . overall , this toy sustain lot abuse , it easy clean keeps kids entertained hours	1
i sent this my daughter my grandson first birthday . she returned it emailed me this comment : quot ; i return pound-a-ball . it looked great , but balls impossible pound through . you couldn't it unless you strength adult . hammer coolest part , but useless getting balls , then when they went down they always took same track didn't really move any other things inside much . quot ; so live learn	1
we bought this our kindergartner who just not remembering how count her " teen " numbers . she our preschooler spent hours it- we counted numbers , guessed what number it , picked our favorite colors ... it bright cheerful gives them big , tangible number hold play . even our " puzzles babies " 7 year old found herself drawn into it we made up game her add subtract numbers it	1
my son received this his 1st birthday instantly loved it ! he loves playing songs , watching train move or just playing animals . he it 3 months so far it very sturdy . no new batteries yet everything still works great despite his battering it !	1
my little boy who 7 months old time received this christmas gift . he totally captivated music animals . he absolutely loves it . , several different tunes , you don't listen same song over over again . great toy !	1
i find it annoying preschoolers so limited what they " supposed " learn know . course , this because parents encouraged teach their toddlers skills required entrance public kindergarten . pre-k screenings across country , 3-4 year olds quizzed basic shapes , colors , whether they recognize their first name , variety other skills deemed " necessary " their local or state board education . while it okay , even necessary point , it also limits free wheeling learning young child mind capable . this puzzle allows little child enquire shapes beyond just square , triangle , rectangle , circle . my little claire loved them tracing . they served race cars . contacts work 100% time ? honest , i can't even tell you ! i not paying attention , i usually there saying shape name , if that what we doing , or if they race cars , saying " vroom " or if we doing colors , saying color name . so -- great puzzle lots shapes , multiple colors . enjoy	1
this great puzzle ! voice speaking names each shape very clear , my 2 year old learning his shapes using it ! puzzle says shape name , then he repeats it . teaches beyond circle , square , triangle ! very good learning tool ! seems durable , batteries lasting quite while .	1
i'm disappointed discover this game too junior myself my friends . question cards experiments way too easy . this game would only interesting somebody third grade or younger . i really hoping somebody invented truly creative game involving science , but this basically something like chutes ladders some very elementary mechanics questions thrown . plus side , game very nicely made cute drawings good artwork . i wish they would make adult version truly creative challenging	1
my almost 3 yr old loves this set . it great quiet activity . there ton beads several laces allowing you make several necklaces . everything fits nicely into storage case .	1
my 3 year old daughter loves this puzzle ! pieces sturdy picture just complicated enough her put together . i think this great puzzle preschoolers .	1
my 3 year old son received this puzzle gift friend he very excited carry it around thomas tin , look picture while he putting it together . great fun	1
we haven't put it up our wall yet , but my son thinks it great . good desig	1
this christmas gift my 8 year old daughter who into absolutely nothing but animals . she absolutely loves it . she turns it every night her our other children go watch it . i even watch it . it two settings . 1 . where it goes through phases moon . i mistaken how this works , i thought it went through phases moon , however , it blinks through them pretty quick . 2 . moon just set single phase moon . i seen them go through both settings , there small remote control child set themselves . only problem remote because its size it get easily misplaced , especially if your kids like mine would lose just anything . my suggestion this would put some velcro back remote stick it somewhere . also it sensor turns off when sun comes up back when sun goes out . it also runs off batteries . ours came cd , which i thought would something they could watch computer , but it isn't it just talking moon . overall it good purchase , i would definitely recommend it child who very hard shop	1
this great idea my 2 kids christmas , i thought . unfortunately giga hassle inflate 15 air chambers took close hour fill . then our first time pushing kids around 2 friends ( only one child time . each kids weight under 80lbs . it rated up 150lbs . ) one air chamber ripped seams . i now giga ball used 1 time duct tape holding one panel together . it ripped 3 four sides holding it together . most chambers held 5 seams . this chamber right one two openings . so my giga ball experience pretty flat	1
my daughter so excited use this toy her friend first warm day spring , but sorely disappointed . it took nearly three hours fill each individual chamber air , time i , her friend go home . if you leave it outside , it gets very grungy it pain clean all grass dirt bug carcasses out crevices . since you can't fit through regular door without deflating it bit , ours wound up mostly outdoors . some chambers leaked went flat . it somewhat fun , although i worried kids would roll over too hard break arm . it hard younger kids push around . my older daughter fun it during raging hurricane , sitting inside hose running . too labor intensive . looked like good idea , but reality pain neck	-1
i got this toy my son when he just mastered sitting up ( 8 months old ) it gave him activity would let him hone skill . he swings ball ( anything else ) little bat loves announcers voice --" it outta here ! " just cracks him up . i recommend it highly . mommy	1
i homeschool my three girls this fun easy way learn locations states . you also learn few fun facts . game says 3rd grade up , but we using it 2nd grade no trouble . it easy set up there only few simple rules . within minutes opening box you learning . fyi : more you need learn states more fun you .	1
this game so much fun , your children won't think they learning they'll want play it all time . because it repetitive easy , children learn fast . i would recomend this game all parent	1
i grew up loving monopoly , still enjoy it occassionally , but adult strategy become painfully obvious . land property , buy it . build houses soon possible . pray dice land right . this edition adds few minor changes completely change stategy winning , while keeping heart game same . if you enjoy board games , this one must	1
i bought this my 15 year old christmas . he didn't want any toys , only $ . i put some gifts under tree , so i chose this figure few others . he really liked it . he set it up immediately display his room . good quality , detailed	1
this horrible product . pieces won't stay together . it would very difficult child put this together without constant adult supervision . product very poor engineering quality control .	-1
not small kids , paint messy . goop good consistency , it would serve science project or so , but not toy	-1
this deck better than kaiba . people usually only buy kaiba deck blue eyes .. but if you want it so bad , buy it seperate . yugi deck actually strategy set . it got assorted variety off all types cards , no , i'm not only saying this because it got stupid axe despair black luster soldier , but because it strategic deck that put together us buy . but don't try using this tournaments because most people know this deck like back their head . wait , people know what back their head looks like ? hang , wait moment while i try andd see back my head .. =	-1
this worth buying go baby alive doll . my daughter loves not only doll , but accessories i purchased	1
my brother purchased this item magic convention , showed it me i one friend mind who kind sense humor . since buying it giving it her , she called saying they ball it . it greatest entertainment there . grown people crazy it . it creates lot laughter . other people wanting borrow it take gatherings/meetings they going entertainment value . you can't keep your hands off it laughter abounds . great , great toy !!! now i think i am going order one myself like my sister . she couldn't resist either	1
this great r/c model ... you need wide open space drive this .... parking lot , basketball court , etc . not driveway or house ... it packs lot speed you need wide open space run . it very responsive , very good proportional controls . no need hop-ups . battery goes 20 minutes full charge . recommend additional battery . i bought 3 , so family i resolve it track not worry bout no point battle !!	1
we bought our son this age 28 months . he'd never lovey or blankie or pacifier or any other those typical comfort things . weird , huh ?? we thought so too . but soon this elmo out box ... he became part family . he ever wants him bath . easy batteries truly adorable toy . it sensors or something so it actually interacts w/ child ... seems like elmo literally talking right you . reasonably priced well worth i	1
i played this my 9 year old daughter , 7 year old son ( who reluctant because it " girly " game , he loved it though wanted play more , but i help him because it requires reading cards play ) , 16 year old son ( who also reluctant -- he won't admit it , but he fun , i'm sure i " force " him play again ! ) it great way get your kids talk each other , laugh joke around , very family oriented . i would highly recommend this family game or game slumber party preteen girls	1
just what we looking . more durable colorful than " disposable " stuff drugstore . this beach set perfect anytime play playground	1
mat entertaining age appropriate . it provided hours pleasure my 21 month old granddaughter her older sister too . it travel-friendly wipes clean . i feel it good value cost item saved other children well . i would definitely purchase this item again gift others	1

planets made sturdy plactic but they not glow long after light turned out - less than 15 minutes . not include sun like some other sets . easy hang	1
my girls loved this doll . it nice her voice sweet not loud others . they try sing together annelise !	1
my daughter recevied this her birthday after i purchased it amazon , i can't tell you how excited she receive it . she plays it constantly , especially when she playing dress-up princess anyhow . i recommend this toy highly . record , she turned 3 her birthday , there no small parts me worry over her choking . most parents , that very important . i know it eases my mind know there really toys like this out there .	1
i didn't any trouble software , my son name list . someone else claimed it doesn't on/off switch , but that not true , it internal box you plug into computer . main problem this toy same problem lot electronic toys . it doesn't really much , nags your child constantly play it . it tell your child when it time lunch or nap or something , but it not like they're going carrying around 24/7 so they're around hear it . mostly what it say " let keep playing , shall we ? squeeze my hand . " then when you , it proclaims it likes same food or animal your child likes . then it asks it hand squeezed again . my son probably little young it , but i can't see him getting all much fun out squeezing teddy bears hand over over listening it electronic yes-man . it not terrible toy but you're probably better off toys engage your child imagination	1
i bought this toy clearance local store around $12 , got it home after reading box , realized i didn't even take it out program it . box flap back lifts up easy access toy , software you use your computer usb cable ! it came equipped everything you need download it ! i pulled cable out , hooked it up toy , turned toy " " position , hooked other end cable up one my pc usb ports , inserted cd rom into drive . software downloaded onscreen directions so easy follow . it took only 15 minutes all get it ready my daughter play . this christmas present , so after i got him programmed , i remember turn him " off " his box so once he wrapped under tree , he wouldn't " talking " , etc . only downfall i mention this toy he only programed 3 songs/stories . you get select up 3 songs/stories software . i wanted 3 songs 3 stories , but choose total 3 alltogether . so i chose two songs , 1 story . but it easy , he ready go ... it bargain me catch him clearance , able program him so easily	1
this one over 30 phonics games little one play . put it front any child 8 or younger they play it . lessons geared toward 6 younger crowd but it great fun anyone . when my son nothing i'll get out one leapfrog books we'll play sound game . this book especially great its letter sounds music . learning last lifetime , so get them started fun friends leap frog .	1
my son 4 finally learned sounds letters this book . characters funny songs so catchy , my son sings letter sound song all time . getting him knowing alphabet song actual sounds letters big leap , but this book really really worked ! i've already bought next 3 phonics books so far , he love them too . he also can't get enough book bob builder , teaching reading comprehension truly fun way he relate . great stuff !	1
harr , landlubbers ! raise mainsail ! hoist mizzen mast ! we're off treasure island mega bloks pyrates ! harrgh ! when i discovered mega bloks producing pirate line , i excited . this definitely something look forward , given mega bloks usual quality attention detail , their pirate islands crews would no doubt absolutely fabulous . well , wait over , pyrates subjected my scrutiny , here result . good news first . check out these minifigs ! this set comes one each type pirate -- sea marauder , privateer , skeleton crew . articulation these guys awesome ! ball joints shoulders hips super posability . legs bend knees , arms bend elbows . head ball joint well . these best minifigs i've ever seen . you pose these guys ways you could only dream posing lego figures . this how all minifigs should . but our good news doesn't end here . detail paint jobs these guys beyond fantastic . detailed outfits , pirate scowls , adventurous facial expressions , texture detail outfits , hats , faces . they're like mini action figures . accessories our three guys include cutlass , pistol , spyglass , ghostly harpoon skeleton , lantern , couple barrels , treasure chest gold . that good news . bad news smugglers fort challenge assemble . there good number large rocky cliff pieces here . i difficulty getting them stick each other . pieces refused grab onto each other . i look underside cliff piece ( where it supposed click onto ) discovered some excess plastic couple little pegs ( which supposed grab onto surface pegs piece ) . excess plastic prevents underside cliff grabbing onto piece . some scissors effort , i able shave just bit this extra plastic off get cliff pieces stick together . however , there just isn't much connecting each piece other begin , so they easily fall apart . it mostly single , flimsy line pegs holding cliffs together . this minimalist building set . assemble some rocky cliff pieces , place few plates trap door across middle , add few stock building blocks good measure , put two walls roofs there give it remote semblance " fort " , slap some ladders there , couple rocks , couple pieces foliage , palm tree , we've got ourselves very mediocre pirate island . behind fort ( i use term loosely ) tall lookout tower . working features include aforementioned trap door , spring-loaded cannon , ... that it . also included rowboat oars shark . durability less than questionable . presuming you're able get this thing built begin , don't expect moving it around much . i lookout tower cliff it built go crashing floor while trying move mine . aside design island rather lackluster ( it could use more foliage , very least ) , design cliff base pieces leaves much desired . let hope mega bloks next attempt pirate island easier get up running better designed . my verdict : one thumb up minifigs , one thumb down smugglers fort . my advice : stick captain cutlass stormstalker , dreadeye phantom , smaller island sets . put together , they enough those cool minifigs keep any pirate captain happy	-1
i bought these 13 year-old christmas . package impossible open . i forgot batteries . when we got batteries , we learned you only play drum one stick , you play cymbals other . so you cannot use them simply drum ! they not work all if you use them tap surface , so you must air drum . also , one two sticks missed every third or fourth beat . this product disappointing it could possibly	-1
when i opened this present , i like " oh great , useless present i never wnat play " well , i opened it up , read simple directions , began making music within next couple minutes . you plug headphones right into it or even plug it into your standard amplifier . i think if you just like playing music toys , then get this . if your actually serious thinking playing drums or whatever , i think you would happy this . even though there only 6 drum sounds , you actually make some serouis music this thing . instead buying $500 electonic drum set , just get these !!! also , since it just classified toy , you would think when you wave stick , sound would come out 10 seconds later or something - well you wrong ! this very very accurate , sound heard soon you wave sticki just think everyone should no these drumsticks amazing , i cant stop playing themnow , stop reading this , scroll up , click " add cart	1
i bought this my cousin who 3 years old . he loves how it talks him . he needs some assistance changing pages , can't figure out games yet , but he learning new words it . i love leappad products used them my children years	1
my daughter 6 leappad books - this only one she doesn't like . i am not sure why , but it just isn't good rest	1
bought this item my granddaughter . sure she love it ... she loves all princess stuff hard time finding this stores .	1
it hard hold his attention . but he loves this cartridge . he watch it 45 minutes straight . , me amazing	1
my 3 year old starting sound out words spell them - all thanks this cartridge . i take lessons he learned use them every day life - this amazing , i believe my son early reader , this giving him amazing boost	1
it doesn't work it states it should . my 6 year old doesn't even try get it work right anymore . christmas we followed directions closely . it doesn't really tell you when you warmer , even when we stood right front it , it didn't say we found it . this waste $30.00 . if your child really wants it , try steer her elsewhere . this not good toy . i suggest game hide seek safari alternative . it works great fun all ages .	-1
when item arrived it much better than anticipated . it super soft very cuddly . i bought it gift almost didn't want give it up	1
this so cute . same idea mr. potato head but more " current " times what kids like . i always love mr. potato head but since my kids enjoy spongebob so much , this perfect ! keep those little pieces together , though	1
i just bought this my birthday i play it lot i like how you change his expresions put gary anywhere . if you like spongebob you'll like this but beware small parts keep them away small children like my brother he almost got hold one	1
i agree person who said it needs cardboard backing or border . since puzzle so large it doesn't interlock , pieces move when my son adds state which makes him angry -- he not yet 3 . i hold down pieces when he adds states if i'm not available help he gets frustrated . addition , because some pieces so large ( oceans texas ) they tend warp more than doug melissa other floor puzzles . puzzle saving grace my son learned all states week	1
i bought this puzzle my 4 year old twin girls . they absolutely love it . pieces cut state lines , which makes this puzzle great learning tool geography . they currently know least dozen state names where they located within continental us . after half dozen times putting this puzzle together using box guide , my daughters able put it together memory . we great conversations each states learn little each one . example , washington state piece picture apple it , so my kids now know washington known its apples . they also understand when i travel where i am going how far i am going relative where we live . i highly recommend this puzzle	1
i'm going get this my nieces . i think comment puzzle not fitting together not proper comment . jigsaw puzzles those which you speaking , because they irregular shapes fit nicely together most cases . puzzles not all jigsaw . just little reminder	1
i'm sad see this toy getting such poor reviews . yes , it say " get out way " " slow down little fella " , but my daughter still loves it . volume control bottom loud louder , that definitely negative me - course it doesn't bother my toddler . but all all , this toy great . it well-loved still works like new . my toddler loves drive , this toy kept her interest over year . just because it not specifically designed education doesn't mean there nothing gained . we make it educational naming animals , shapes , numbers , letters colors toy . we also sing songs " radio " - my child gotten so good it , she hit button rapid succession get song she wants . fun toy	1
terrible . if i'd heard what it said annoying tone it always speaks , i never would bought it . it high quality , it won't break . i've tried . nothing like teaching your kid honk horn obnoxious voice yell " get out way ! " . " slow down little fella .... " why makers assume only boys would play this toy ? don't waste your money .	-1
i guess some these other reviewers got this toy 18 or 19 month old child ... well my mother bought this my 8 month old daughter she loved it day one ! out all christmas presents she received few weeks after getting this toy she only plays this toy . we take it car , we take it when we're visiting course we play it home . she absolutely loves it ! i guess i see where " rudeness " comments come but child this young it still doesn't really matter so maybe you should buy this toy if it younger baby rather than 18 month old .	1
i don't actuelly this set , but i want point out some options possiblities this set . 1 . you could take leaves ( there only 3 them)and realy good if not exellent replica clean x-wing . 2 . leaves tie fighters , bombers or darth vaders tie fighter you could recreate scenes battels both star wars 4 6 . i also want say how much improvment this set over original . first : color it much better . secound : " nose " swept . really missing original . third:it more proportional than original	1

i'm only writing this say my young children love these things great time them they very child friendly . before buying them , i read few places these too difficult children more appropriate adults musical experience . it toy ! if adults fun cool stuff them , great , but they made , sold used toy . why not 5 star rating ? no reason other than it not their favorite toy . :)	1
these markers great . my grandaughter loves them i like them because they don't make too much mess	1
what happened hot wheels tracks ? anyone else remember when you could buy box whole bunch track connectors create your own layouts ? sets available come paltry 2 or 3 yards track maybe bunch hard plastic pieces . only limited number configurations possible .	1
this awesome toy .... this my son very 1st hot wheels toy he loves it . my husband likes it well . :) it very sturdy toy cars fine track . only problem i it where booster batteries , it very light . when cars come around go thru booster , it really shakes moves around lot lifts off ground . it not effect track , but they could make heavier so it not move around floor ....	1
i just came back buying electronic battleship advanced mission game . first , i bought one comes blue box . after five minutes into game , i could see how badly this game . especially annoying voice announcer lets you know if you hit or miss target because not only he sounds awful but also you just cannot understand what he says . therefore , if you playing advanced weapons use tomahawk missile , when game announces spaces you hit missed you not able tell difference two no matter how many times you press repeat button . it so frustrating i immediately packed game went back refund . then i saw electronic battleship advanced mission comes green box i exchanged it one . wow , what difference ! voices , sounds , design , everything just excellent . here what you get this new revised game . remember , it one green box . 1 . original game play bigger grid ( 10 14 ) , salvo mission ( you fire one shot each one your ships still afloat ) target plus one mission , or bonus mission ( you earn extra turn every hit or successful scan until you miss ) . 2 . advanced weapons now used salvo bonus missions . 3 . voice announcer understandable . you no problem whatsoever understanding hits misses . 4 . attack squadron planes now move scan same turn , planes now scan space immediately underneath them . beware anti-aircraft missile battery , only defense against these pesty little creatures . 5 . aircraft carrier missiles eliminated . now attack squadron planes equipped one-time use only missile automatically hits every space where it detects enemy target . it first target found only , then it only scans . 6 . battleship one tomahawk missile hits everything 3 3 square where it lands . now called light missile cruiser two harpoon missiles covers three vertical or horizontal spaces . fast-attack sub two torpedoes travel one side other grid unless it hits target first . sub also scanner tell you enemy ship vicinity but not tell you precise location unlike attack squadron planes . 7 . new design brings game eye level but if you must you place it conventional way . ships redesigned place where you store pegs actually works ( you know , it not open after storage ) . plus pegs not fall grid easily . 8 . new sound effects cool necessary . before sound missile launching hit too confusing . now not only you distinguish two but also there different colored lights indicated launches , scans , hits misses . my opinion , this great upgrade classic game . small screen record your latest moves still necessary . i mean , more than once we found ourselves forgetting what pattern we choose our planes scan repeat button repeats only last sentence said . but until then , enjoy this beautiful impressive electronic battleship . it actually made me remember how i felt around twenty years ago when i got first electronic battleship made . i hope you much fun i then now . bye .	1
i really enjoyed this game first loved playing it our friends . but , after playing 6 games you're . what waste money . you basically get 6 hours playtime total you might well throw game out . big bummer . wish i bought scene it music edition instead ..	1
we really enjoyed playing riff . this real music trivia game , great challenging questions broad range music topics . we played hours , plus we could check inside hard rock vault see some rock roll memorabilia . highly recommend this game ( it also great value money ) . others just riff-offs	1
i bought this game order spend some quality time my family - cottage , sunday evenings . what great investment . best aspects this game it interactive ( players chase each other ) , it very quick learn ( great kids ) , outcome doubt right up until end . adults certainly substitute money tokens ball , kids just happy clobbering their parents or siblings . i highly , highly , recommend this game !!	1
major fun ! this pitching game attaches door interactive play . we hung ours door end hallway . backdrop nicely padded , so far all heavy pitching , there no damage door . led display keeps track strikes balls needs three aaa batteries . game come them but you want extras hand . our son enjoys playing this himself , his dad , grandfather , sisters . i hear lot laughter whenever he playing big boys . seems they like argue umpire calls . great family fun baseball fans .	1
i only got this toy this summer but we enjoyed it . we live river swim it constantly , my son ( 8 1/2 ) i . it so cool see fish lights give enough light see betewwn rocks . it fun . it so far held up well strap pretty durable but seems ealy replace if it break	1
my almost-3-year old daughter loves this toy . she also maid marian set loves 2 princesses ride carriage . she likes putting knight set into horse , she tell they all " go " together , versus her fp house . because my daughter princess fantatic , this set huge hit : especially since cinderella re-released * this * set carriage . who knew 3 year old would know what carriage ball ? i think it delightful she actually pretends go ball carries conversations princesses . imaginative play , i gave this toy 5 star rating . our princess bit well-loved ( some paint missing ) , but who wouldn't after continual living little girl pocket ? definitely recommended toy	1
this fun toy . our 2-year-old son like it , but it doesn't get played very often . fun camera though - when it gets played . ;	1
gorgeous doll . simply stunning . she so beautiful i decided not give it my daughter last christmas instead wait until she older . since she 3 , i decided collect these signature dolls few years present them all her when she 10-12 years old	1
we collect barbies our youngest daughter . we saw this advertised few weeks before christmas $14.99 then didn't see it again until 2 weeks after same price . gorgeous doll , great price quick shipping	1
i very impressed delivery time my order happy product . cost better then other places most stores sold ou	1
my daughter loved these . my only negative battery hard change since screw stripped so easily	1
this pretty nice little game . it keep you busy help pass time . there lot different puzzles , so you never play same one twice . i only draw back i found date depending lighting screen little hard see . overall this fantastic little game	1
i've wanted this while , but thought price bit high . i recently found it sale purchased it i say , even regular price , this fun item . i wasn't disappointed . even easy puzzles little bit challenge ( it definitely ny times ) . mediums ones great brainteasers . i haven't tried difficult ones yet ! two warnings : first , system itself very small . great travel ( fits nicely into small purse ) , but i imagine this would very hard older eyes . my father little difficulty seeing it he just middle-aged . i can't imagine how difficult this might elderly ! second , it doesn't mark which puzzles you've already ( or if it , i haven't figured out how it ) . each time you choose puzzle , you choose numbered list . would nice if it either marked ones you've or random generator . ( 1,000 puzzles choose , i think choosing numbered list eventually chore . ) other than those two things , it great little machine . i'm taking it me my next vacation	1
most reviews similar theme , great product but not exactly intuitive fold up put away . this should help : how fold - http://playhut.com/fold_instructions.phpthe dora hut similar screen room 200-500 series written directions but video only shows how put it up . taking it down watch " hideaway adventure " video watch closely few times . it much smaller but folds exact same way . here link video - http://playhut.com/images/fold/0bf7634b04a5fb7763f45c10fb847973hideaway-folding.wmvworst case scenario - toll free : 888-playhut	1
i bought this my child outdoor birthday party . it unstable . it falls over when kids play inside . it too hot , air not circulate inside . three short horizontal poles which you insert give it structure warped when it outside garden . it hot here but no excuse such poor quality . i am plannng give it away . maybe someone find use it	-1
friends out town introduced us this game , time passes so quickly this game . instuctions little laborious , but once you start playing everyone catches . it strategy game several levels . cards 1 ) pictures merchant ships differing levels loot ( gold pieces ) 2 ) pirate ships various ' power ' levels 3 ) pirate admirals ( trump card , effectively . ) game progresses players attempt capture other players ' merchies maximize gold pieces while trying prevent their own merchies captured . trust me , it fun family . course , everyone talk like pirate .	1
this line figures mcfarlane quite different take classic fairy tales . little red riding hood possibly best bunch . it great looking figure sm style red . she scantily clad dons spike studded boots ; sliced open wolf accessory pretty grusome but all-in-all this one fantastic looking display piece . that point , it display not really toy . red stellar stand-out piece this sadistic set	1
bought this my grandsons christmas . they 6 , they love this toy . it well made toy numerous parts put together many different ways . they love all mega rig toys spend many enjoyable hours playing them	1
my 5 year old son got this santa this year he thrilled it . he asking this months course , we scared it would not live up commercials . we plesantly surprised toy sturdy , easily assembled easy younger kids manipulate . this toy breaks apart into 25 separate pieces so you several different variations theme- it great see my son creativity come out ! plus pieces basically big colorful enough you won't constantly worry pieces lost . i highly recommend this , especially now i see price $[ ... ] less then what we paid	1
tinkerbell uno best game ever !!! i played this last year thanksgiving best time !! gotta love pixie dust protection card . come now , name like , how could this game not great ?!?!?!?	1
we use this timer clean up . it great b/c my kids love race against time they see . we also use it make them brush their teeth more than 30 seconds . i think it little expensive what it thoug	1
time tracker great idea , however , we've found it works best if you program it manually . it works well keeping kids task while eating their breakfast mornings before school timing video game play . i also bought ac adapter , but without batteries it sort flimsy , if you unplug it ( which easy , esp . if kids pick it up ) you reprogram everything . ( it not if it constant use except clock ) we've found since our kids 6 4 concept time foreign , this way it warns them when they minute or so left play it seems cure disappointment turning off t.v. etc ..	1
i purchased this toy my son this afternoon he hasn't kept his hands off it all night . he 3 1/2 loves puzzles computer games . he especially loves it handle looks like briefcase . he trying read directions inside cover tried almost all puzzles so far . i looking purchase extra card sets very soon .	1

mumble adorable , everything i thought he would . i am very satisfied this product	1
i purchased this safe 6 year old boy . it easy him use perfect his age	1

this stuff waste money . it too sticky anything . i threw it all away kids didn't even care . lousy product	-1
purchased it my girls christmas . tough assemble , but smooth ride fits my 8 yr old four yr old comfortably . deep wagon -- big wheels . i plan use it yard work when girls grow out it	1
my kids , ages 3 5 love this puzzle . however , i don't think it challenging ( i.e. it doesn't keep them occupied too long ) but i guess it age thing . highly recommended first puzzle	1
dread pirate ( second edition ) , front porch classics , one most attractive interesting games i've ever come across . it not game casual game-player , but real collector , this game perfect . front porch classics calls its games " coffee table games " , meaning they're attractive enough leave display while they're not played . game not come cardboard box , rather , it beautiful wooden treasure chest . game " board " actually large pirate map , printed piece fabric . each player gets solid metal ship ( which large-about 2 inches tall inch half wide stem stern ! ) which they move around playing board rolling wooden dice or drawing pirate card . object game collect doubloons treasure moving around board , raiding other pirate ships ports . treasures small jewels , much like those which often come mancala sets . doubloons real ( heavy ! ) golden metal coins which look quite like what one might imagine pirates ' booty would actually look like . each player keeps their collected treasures gorgeous velvet bags they play game . addition beautiful fun game , dread pirate also informative . instruction booklet includes excerpts 1691 journal captain arthur howell , each " dread pirate " card lists fun fact pirates . any avid game collector who appreciates attractive games incorporate real materials who enjoys clever strategy games love dread pirate .	1
i very happy service . items i purchased shipped good condition timely fashion . i would highly recommend making purchases through them	1
fun play friends , easy game people pickup you never out game until very end .	1
i'm one weirdos liked rodimus prime . his character depth , arguably most all g1 next star scream . so i buy this figure . excellent . transformation very smooth . acurate alt mode robot mode . love it . definitely worth $10 it'll cost you retail store . look out wild first	1
he voiced judd nelson , replaced optimus prime leader autobots , hated fans , called variety names : hot rod , rodimus prime , rodimus major . through it all though , he still makes one sweet toy longtime transformers collectors blast . since hasbro no longer owns rights name hot rod , rodimus here all his glory this deluxe classic figure , he looks sweet . looking pretty much like futuristic sports car debuted 1986 animated movie , rodimus , previous reviewer already pointed out , surprisingly easy transform back forth vehicle robot . robot form , rodimus looks pretty good well , albeit bit bulkier than he ever cartoon , but that nothing new transformer figures though it ? he comes missle launcher actually shoots easily put his hands . all all , rodimus great transformers toy collectors young old love , he deserves welcome place any collection	1
todd macfarlane it again this awesome tom brady figure . last , new england patriots get respect they deserve this incredible piece work always remind patriots fans their improbable super bowl xxxvi victory ! usual , attention detail amazing . i hope macfarlane consider making figure some other patriots . i think players like troy brown , adam vinateri , ty law lawyer milloy deserve much credit brady their success . thanks todd macfarlane keep up great work	1
if you new bionicle don't many sets , you won't appreciate iruini much . it still great toy it own- poseable , fun build , just looks cool . but if you few other bionicle sets , toa especially , you'll really appreciate this one . while his construction similar toa metru , it little different . most notably , round shield his chest his mask . mask hasn't used before or since , it gold boot ! all his gold pieces welcome new additions my collection . plus , his unique building techniques ( shield his chest , making his staff ) opened up alot ideas me use my other bionicle sets . his rhotuka-disk launching shield my favorite part all . it looks really cool ! it kind hard use it launch disks , so i just use it hold disks . slot holds ( not launches ) his second disk particularly interesting looking . like vent or sorts . clumsyness launcher doesn't take much away set , i don't launch them anyway . launched disks tend dissappear , only end up mangled cat toy pile .	1
i bought toa iruni my self spare allowence money it worth everything it cost . all i see way negatives 1 , spinneres rip cord always seem get lostand never found . 2 , i personoly am geting board toa metru desinge . enouge abuot cons pros . 1 iruni extreamly flexibal all toa . golden chronicle staff tip allown makes it worth measly $9.00 it costs .	1
this bionicle great . there cool peices including sheild fires out spinner . also , toa iruini brand new mask really cool . he also posed bunch ways . this bionicle one two special edition bionicles , so if you collect bionicles , you should get this set . this set definetly worth money	1
tank this small should only used betta fish . any other fish need good filter , heat , oxygenation . still it way small even worth it . my advice you save your money , go buy 10 gallon kit your starter aquarium . then you keep some realy fish . also goldfish should kept least 30 gallon aquarium , so i even if you get 10 gallon , please research fish before you buy them	-1
this very very difficult toy maintain . gravel extremely difficult remove clean without getting cardboard background wet . after one cleaning cardboard background gets wet that end . plastic scratches very easily pieces periscope broke off easily well . goldfish need lots water this doesn't lend itself many types fish . i never such difficult time trying maintain integrity toy while trying keep fish alive tank clean well . not recommended all . save your money " real " tank	-1
our son received video now xp gift , it kept him happy all weekend . he loves he'll able take it car long ( or short ) trips . i love it help our kids not fight backseat . there lots possible pvds we purchase future . much better alternative than our laptop or renting dvd player car or airplane trips . we're thrilled	1
" pistol " pete maravich could not big star n.b.a. he college , but because when he louisiana state university playing his father " press " maravich he greatest scorer all-time . but what made him legendary showman not only he score lot points , inventing ways put ball hoop his way basket , but also he threw passes like he playground . scoring machines not usually dribble behind their back or make passes legs . his day maravich considered hotdog , but he popular hotdog . he also legendary gym rat , who dribbled ball everywhere he went . l.s.u. he scored 43.6 points game freshman team . then he moved varsity over next three seasons he led nation scoring averaging 43.8 , 44.2 , 44.5 points per game . senior he scored 50 points or more ten times . . u . ' 31 games , setting n.c.a.a. records most points ( 1,381 ) highest scoring average single season . 1970 he named college player year , but tigers went nit because they played southeast conference dan issel kentucky wildcats ( remember when only one team conference went n.c.a.a. tournament ) . course maravich holds virtually every major scoring record n.c.a.a. , most career points ( 3,667 ) highest career scoring average ( 44.2 ppg ) , most field goals made ( 1,387 ) attempts ( 3,166 ) , most career 50-point games ( 28 ) . imagine what he would if they three-point shot back then . maravich selected atlanta hawkws 3rd pick 1970 n.b.a. draft ( behind bob lanier rudy tomjanovich ) . he scored 23.2 points his rookie season named n.b.a. all-rookie team . but case college , maravich scored lot points entertained fans , but his teams not win lot games exited quickly playoffs each year . when expansion new orleans jazz created 1974-75 season , they traded maravich bring him back " home " louisiana . but winning new orleans proved even harder than winning atlanta . but he win his only scoring title jazz 1976-77 . then he injured his knee following season when jazz went utah he ended up released finished his career coming off bench boston celtics during larry bird rookie season . maravich averaged over 24 points game his 10-year career , which pretty good until you consider it 20 points less than what he averaged college . maravich elected naismith memorial basketball hall fame 1987 , named nba 50th anniversary all-time team 1996 . but pistol pete died 1988 , suffering heart attack age 40 while playing pickup game gym . this 6-inch ( scale ) figure maravich bringing up ball jazz wearing purple home jersey team . however , if you make effort you find atlanta hawks variation well , but maravich greatest player history new orleans jazz ( karl malone gets greatest franchise history nobody new orleans hornets topped maravich yet ) . figure extremely limited amount articulation , basically neck right bicep , looks like pistol pete whip bounce pass someone . base basketball court , you might find some minor warping top layer . maravich part mcfarlane sports picks nba legends series 1 , which includes basketball hall famers julius erving philadelphia 76ers , larry bird boston celtics , bill walton portland trailblazers , wilt chamberlain philadelphia warriors , willis reed new york knicks . again , aware there some variants out there most these figures : erving net , walton white instead red , reed blue instead white . hopefully future series they continue go even more old school , which would mean not only likes bob cousy elgin baylor , but i think george mikan figure would totally appropriate	1
well , here i am one more dissatisfied customer ! you would think someone singer would read these something it !! " it really sews !

i first skeptical due manufacturer recommended age 18 mo . my daughter big 3 year old ( 41 " tall ) trike perfect her ( its eaven shortest seat position ) . she loves it !! its easy assemble if you experience , otherwise it comes terrible assembly manual instructions barely no pictures guide you . overall good , although no streamers .	1
my daughter got these christmas loves them . when we walk around neighborhood she wears them jumps all way . she 10 usually complains her legs hurting when walking running but not these ! rubber bands brake frequently we need replace them often but shoes came plenty	1
these seemed like such good idea my daughter her best friend actually willing spend their own hard-earned money them . so we bought them i spent hour or so assembling two pairs . within hour we knew they go back . first foremost , girls totally disappointed what they . blame box , it deceptive , but i willing chalk up real world education would let my daughter deal lesson . more disturbing we replace half dozen or more black rubber bands within time , they snapped . now i know why they give you so many , it not just heaviest kids ( who proabably too old toy begin . ) it so every time kids use them adult spend time putting new bands ... until you run out . needless say , they went back same day .	-1
it ok . i thought it would red laser dot coming out . it only makes sounds . they only played it few times . i little disappointed it . ( parent speaking	-1
my kids love this geotrax addition !!! kids love watch trains go through tower activate music . all you push button top when you start play trains light sensor set music trains pass though . after couple minutes no train activity , it turn itself off . only down side would it plus if you lots track it requires some elevation track . so i wouldn't recommend it if you only basic geotrax package .	1
yet great geo trax product . great pricing .. great value ! we love geo traxwe family get down play this product line .. great quality , great pricing , incredable imagination builder ! our little geo city grows grows every gift giving holiday	1
i love cabbage patch babies . i ordered this baby advertised page , thinking it would look just same . it red hair , but not purple outfit different hair style . my daughter personally picked this one out different one sent . i didn't know they send whatever may look similar . baby cute anyway - outfit probably not one i would picked if i saw it store .	1
this great set young experimentor . i bought it my 6 year old who asking chemistry set . it uses items you should already around house , like salt baking soda . they easy experiments . i would recommend this maybe 5-9 . younger ones need parental help , but it fun	1
this toy durable ! it survived my 10 year old son early childhood , now ( so far ) survived my 3 year old daughter attacks . both children love it , but others mentioned , some pieces loose it takes perserverence keep it together . my cure i hide it except trips doctors other appointments . this makes it quot ; specialquot ; toy , it easier keep track parts . many bright pages colors keep their interest , though they love pulling out snap-on pieces , they difficult little one snap . velcro balloons attached my daughter ( mine ) favorite part . buckle too difficult her , but she loves putting her hand glove unzipping lady-bug find quot ; babyquot ; lady bugs . i feel positives far outweigh negatives highly recommend this toy -- after all , if she not losing these pieces under couch , she would losing her barbie car keys , lego pieces , building blocks , lincoln logs ( etc ) under couch	1

this handheld game potential fun yet educational toy young minds but instead , it processes jeopardy quot ; answersquot ; scroll pattern moves quite slowly also provides quot ; questionsquot ; scroll multiple choice selections . device operates off two aa batteries secured backside beneath screwed cover takes eyeglass screwdriver access . i think screw cover great idea kids but wish screw larger size so time isn't lost picking up smaller tool . anticipation great toy entertain road trips but toy just didn't measure up jeopardy name	1

after three years dragons who walk all fours , we get dragon who stands upright . seems kind strange . stendhal one most detailed dragons date , sporting some impressive articulation dragon roar feature . he doesn't light up , but he variety growls roars activated button his chest . he lot articulation . his hind legs ( which he stands ) stiff only move back forth . but it gets much better when we examine his arms head . his arms move back forth , away his body . shoulder joint move two directions . we get two additional points articulation elbows wrists ( his wrists turn addition claws moving back forth ; really nice ! ) . his neck move back forth , his head move all manner directions . always , his jaw opens . his tail flexible super-posability , his towering wings . he also turn waist ( very cool ! ) . my only complaint this guy articulation his stiff hind legs . stendhal mostly dark red black highlights , white claws his feet , silver colored armor . mentioned , detail here better than ever , everything realistic look . armor his left arm different his right arm ( nice touch ! ) , his wings even some pieces armor them . he comes removable piece armor his jaw . i think he looks better without it , but maybe that just me . stendhal one most charismatic dragons i've seen ( it all face eyes ) . this action figure comes almost completely assembled . i just pop his head onto his jaw attach his wings . also included some parts building small tower torch light flag , odaku warrior shield weapon . i very pleased stendhal . he got my recommendation big thumbs up . i like detail articulation , especially movable claws articulated wrists . stendhal great addition any dragons collection fun action figure play around	1

if you're looking hours fun doesn't get " boring " , this game you . okay , enough pitch :) we play lot board games--we're sort fanatics -- usually we get tired game after while . carcassonne unique respect every time you play game , your objectives different ( particularly expansion packs ) so it doesn't get old . family fun almost everyone , carcassonne game engages logic imagination . game last several hours ( depending how many expansion packs you want put into mix ) or you play quick game without losing overall impact or any fun ( which unique board game arena -- where you usually " cut " rules or objectives play quick game ) . this game also unique fact multiple people play -- or just pair people play equally engaging way . there aren't many two player games out there , quite few other games become dull when less than 3-4 people play together . that simply not case here . set itself enviable anyone who basic carcassonne set , or purchased expansion packs seperately , i appreciate everything kept together one neat little box . if you're considering basic carcassonne set , spring " big box " you won't regret it . this would make great gift board game puzzle lovers all ages ( probably 8 or 9 up -- though younger kids love watch " help " ) . it would also unique gift readers fantasy , those good imaginations ( or need little imagination exercise :) . overall , this highly recommended product . fact , i can't think bad thing say it . first time i played it , i hooked . don't say i didn't warn you	1
this set includes all individual expansion sets game carcassonne . this provides two great advantages : price storage . first , i calculated difference list price each expansion set individually " big box " , it comes out 25% savings . ( this not take into account any discounts ) . plus , note these games not sold amazon , but third party resellers not free shipping , so i would add $10 extra shipping , which , if you factor everything , comes out 40% discount buying everything " big box " instead separately . pretty good . second , more importantly me , box single box ( instead 6 different boxes ) it well organized inside . i don't want all clutter 5 or six different packages . this keeps them all together , which nice ! there 5 different storage places box where you put tiles go each expansions . this makes it easy play original game alone , then add expansions you see fit . i never played original game when i bought " big box " , but i decided buy this anyway because all great reviews i read . i am really glad i . i love original game , expansions making it more exciting reinvigorating game play when we add new tiles . pieces ( box ) high quality , this makes games lot more fun look , fun handle . nothing looks poor quality . reason i like this game two players play this game alone , sometimes it hard find games like . you typically two owners game third person who plays less often always disadvantage . also , game doesn't last too long . you not going get bogged down hours , you " get game " before you go bed , or before you go out . note : you also may see some other " carcassonne " games : " carcassonne : castle " , " carcassonne : hunters gatherers " , " carcassonne : city " , " carcassonne ark covenant " . none these games expansion set carcassonne , they each individual standalone games . therefore , don't worry they not included " big box " , because they shouldn't	1

if you know lot trivia you'll like this game because you've got listen clue make decision - fast ! unfortunately people who don't know lot trivia , or who don't want concentrate so hard , make it guessing game/game chance . because every time they hold up their fact/crap sign they 50/50 chance winning . this slows down game such players rarely guess first right so no one gets pick up double chips . play if you're easy going handle both styles player or choose crowd trivia mavens fun out-knowing * stuff * . game takes hour finish , or you could start fewer chips it end soone r.p.s. i would not recommend this game children . it contains lot difficult words , like latin names plants/animals , odd place names , etc . some over-30 crowd game i played couldn't pronounce " catalan " ( language) ! i imagine would frustrating child	1
main tools great my 19 month old plays them daily . nuts , bolts , nails kind useless because they difficult hold work same time .	1
there no equal this game . taboo , outburst , scattergories , password - all good , but this great . minimum 6 people maximum fun . pick creative , smart crowd though . if word quot ; panquot ; then quot ; tinkerbellquot ; job faster than quot ; potquot ; . review below said they couldn't get 1 word 5 very sad . we always start bidding 7 words i've even seen 4 clues 5 words once ! there no board so i throw timer cards my weekend bag everywhere we go case rain/snow . inevitably friend say , quot ; you bring ' words' ? quot	1
warning : not purchase this game unless you willing continue host more parties . your guests request rematch after rematch . we play men vs . women . inevitably there ton laughter . game piques your creativity . time element keeps things moving , so time flies . we never stopped 10-card quot ; officialquot ; win -- it just too much fun	1
when i saw this toy it looked like it would so cute so i bought it my baby . coming sassy , i thought it must good . boy , i disappointed . you pull string , put water , it just sits there string going back . i thought we broken one until i read other reviews they all said same thing . sassy should ashamed putting their good name such poor product . it really isn't even worth 1 star , but you can't give 0 stars . if i could i would definitely give this loser toy 0 stars . how disappointing coming company who won toy awards so many other toys	-1
we bought this our 7 year old son . he wanted something went fast . like most 8 year olds he bit rough his toys , but this proven withstand abuse ! it go fast , sometimes so fast it hard him control , but then it crashes half fun . i highly recommend adding recharagable battery pack , it keeps fun going , charges quickly	1
i'm risk fan , but don't get many opportunities play . i find this version fun fascinating variation . it integrates very well movie theme provides dramatic twist where one side gets automatically take random territories certain point game . ( it order 66 if you remember sw episode iii . ) rules pretty well laid out easy understand if you already know risk rules . all new rules all blue so you skim quickly through them . if you aren't familiar risk , i recommend skipping all blue rules play classic game first . just keep mind it more fun all rules . some new variations original include : 1 . cards special thematic actions you take advantage 2 . powerful anakin cards which become useless republic player after order 66 . 3 . ability turn collected cards space ships lend bonuses your rolls ( instance , roll 8-sided die rather than 6 or re-roll any ones . ) 4 . special thematic characters republic catch ( separatists hide ) earn bonus cards . 5 . dramatic order 66 dynamic which gives seperatists chance convert territories ( armies ) their side . longer they hold out against card advantage republic more damage they . 6 . two player game actually fun unlike most other risk variations . low point star wars risk : clone wars ugly , ugly board . you might expect something gorgeous since it based such visually oriented movie franchise , but board definitely function over form . least it doesn't get way game play . i highly recommend this game risk fans more dramatic shorter variation . after playing few times when everyone gets rules , you might even get game under 3 hours . that very short risk . those who compare variations , i find theme artistry lord rings variation far superior it introduced some game play ideas this game use . however , i find star wars risk : clone wars much more fun overall . i've heard more complicated " hardcore " variations risk like godstorm 2210 a.d. better games , but i haven't played thos e.p.s. review here suggested separatists always win . hasn't my experience i've seen discussions forums opposite situations where republic always wins . it all strategy ... die rolls . :) later this year ( 2006 ) , there supposed risk game based original trilogy star wars movies . i'm very much looking forward	1
this best board game i ever playe	1
this set so cute , so true movie character outfits , etc . box used cinderella room . you close it up velcro flap it even handle . it cardboard box though , handled care . but i always feel these companies never fully test these products before they put them market . both sets shoes not stay , ever . they sort dangle . her two wigs not sit perfectly her head either , they constantly falling off . dressing stand bit clumsy . but ... i guess these things i noticed . my daughter hasn't bothered much , only shoes . canopy bed great though , it her favorite part set . price , i guess you're getting what you pay . i hope they improve way shoes stay , but now , we still continue buy disney princess mini playsets anyway . precious years our little ones into this phase so limited , i guess i'll take shoes don't fit lost few days . we're making memories playing set together , all matters	1
i bought this card shuffler i must say , it a-m-a-z-i-n-g ! i shuffles each deck 4 or 5 times every time it usually works flawlessly . i used it year . when i use it , i use it hours time . 9v battery works long time too . it noisy sometimes , but not often , gets jammed . but overall i give this product 5/5 because it so much better than hand shuffling . course it going noisy jam up time time because it automatic . think it . it shuffles deck card , cards extremely thin sometimes it gonna slip it . but it not big deal . buy this say goodbye manual shuffling forever !!!	1
this game hysterical fun . anyone 12 years old up play it . we play it every chance we get invariably end up laughing our a**es off ! drinking alcohol whilst playing may cause inability finish game due uncontrollable laughter . huge hit everyone we've played . makes charades look like fluffy , boring affair	1

i saw shout movies tv thought it would make fun gift . turns out i right , game fantastic great fun . trivia ranges quotes , movie stills scenes movies . only problem after you play title initial 3 games , disc useless . you see , shout movies gives you 3 games play start . each game same layout rounds , but uses different questions . sure questions different games , but if you replay game , you get same questions answers thus ruining replay factor . $20+ i would expect little more than 3 games . i really like game , but i can't justify spending $20 other discs zero replay	-1

it good toy , but sometimes vowels don't work . even when you enough money buy vowel push " buy " button , it doesn't work . it still fun toy you tote it where ever you go . this not complaint , but when you push volume button , sound , it goes mute instead lowering volume . sometimes it just little too loud .	1
i truly enjoy this handheld game . i find screen bit small my visual capablities this time . it fast accurate . i believe it played more one player , but not time investigate this yet . it capablity using sound or not , which great public settings . there subtotal button so you see how close getting extra points scoring 3 kinds top row . you able see your highest score touch button . this game much more enjoyable playing stratagies i learned over years . again , its great game but hard my vision .	1

these yahtzee jr. games wonderful all ages , including preschoolers just old enough identify pictures count 5 . i owned one several years , i never tire playing it my grandchildren neighbor children . only downside this particular version there more than one disney " character " each side dice , making it more difficult call out exactly which character you trying . all-in-all , this still great game all kids , young old	1

we love this puzzle but it 48-piece puzzle not 100-piece puzzle ... wrong info this site	1
i purchased christmas gift . item arrived timely fashion , well packaged well received . however , i disappointed find it my local store $8.00 cheaper . but there element shopping home .	1
this great product , our family loves it . car seat base work just like real thing . 1 . it heavy duty , this not some cheap piece plastic . my kids could not break it if they tried . 2 . seat pad removable washable , but more importantly it stays when kids play it ! 3 . 5-point harness chest clip let kids buckle up baby doll properly correctly just like any good parents would . harness quality better than most real strollers i seen . 4 . it even comes latch attachment cars car seat anchors . 5 . car seat snaps clicks into place when put into car seat base . hopes this helps , you won't disappointed my daughters love it .	1
although i'd love get my hands transformers i grew up , i feel these new updated versions definitely improved . others mentioned , they much more poseable than i remember them . prime got fully articulated hips , knees , elbows , etc . great keep your hands occupied while long phone calls ..	1
this still bit different than g1 cartoon where smoke stacks shoulders , no wind deflector cover which new all trucks anyway , least not trucks late 80 . but figure very anatomically proportional , joints mostly flexible , so i put it many really cool poses i come up , it would stand sturdily . both guns transformable integrates into truck which very good design touch . g1 robots look better staying transformed modes , but this one way cooler pose your room/cube robot mode . i admit not trailer box/command center like original version bit disappointing , i feel like i'm not getting my money worth :-) some rotating parts distinct clicking sound when moved , makes me reminesce when i played w/ older robots little kid , making my own sound while transforming robots . this might not suitable kids too young because some parts very stiff i afraid if i pull too hard i may break something . make sure you follow manual when transforming , until you routine memorized . overall , this very good toy moderately complex design , definitely keeper collectors	1
this good game plenty re-play value . travel addition small light helps long plane trips . i could quibble ... quality unit isn't great - it hard get pieces out after game little pieces small hard handle get lost . but why quibble ? it small light cheap fun	1
i luv it i just got it yesterday already played it although lil tip- people who cd player-burner computer , dont plug little cord bottom headphone jack if you it top one it works better it anyway i gave it five stars overall because its fun !!	1
this really cool . it bratz stage . it unessisery play but it make it funner . i reccomend this all . it also go bratz rock angels recording studio playset bratz rock angelz band instrumentz playset . rock angelz best all bratz . this completes my collection rock angel bratz . my opinion , this best . you noticed it also most expensive though ? use ebay save $$$ ( hint hint ! ) this not educational all dont worry , it doen't teach music	1
great horse , great toy . i love how horse moves so nicely , my daughter put saddle bridle horse . my only complaint i no idea why they made reins so hard keep . far i tell , they just hang end bridle , every time you move , reins come off . am i missing something ? this one little annoying detail detracts toy , which why i gave it only four stars	1
i got this because my grandchildren always wanting play ceramic manger my mother made . these figures just right size their little hands i still teach them what manger stands hands-on teaching instead always telling them leave it alone because it break . they great time it	1
view master still fun toy all . my daughter loves it . it durable always .	1
i bought 2 plasmacars my lower body disabled grandkids , ages 4 6 christmas . putting them together required hammer intelligence but essentially very straightforward . they portable , easily used very much enjoyed my girl boy grandkids . they unable use their feet so need use their hands locomotion , this perfect their needs . plasmacars also large sturdy enough so bigger kids family also easily use them without destroying them their larger size . so far they durable enough withstand active children , including 3 large boys play . grandma marily	1
i like light side . sith only use their anger . like anakin says episode iii , i see lies jedi . i don't fear sith you . so , i got blue . me my friend fight very fast . just like movies . blue lightsaber very good . you get fine grip it so you battle . it doesn't light up , but it still fun . i looks like anakin lightsaber . fulfill your destiny ! may force you	1
i think this cool . it much more realalistic then electric one since electric one part blade sticking out . thiss one doesnt this one much more fun play because it strong . electric one break so when you fight you hit soft thats not fu	1
my 3 year old got bella cheerleading christmas . she absolutely loves this toy . she now cheerleader loves cheer moves she learning . it first thing she wants when she wakes up last thing before bed . i love watching her learn moves doing cheers . i think this great toy give it highest rating . i wish i could buy cheer outfit girls wear video . would top off whole cheerleading experience	1
my son got this his birthday when he turned 4 . he actually very good it . it helps him gain better control his fine motor skills . unfortunately , my 2 year old daughter thought it looked like fun too . instead trying play game it intended , she decided chew little body part pieces . game rated older children , but 4 seems like ok age start . just beware getting this game if you smaller children around who may try hijack pieces eat them . they dont fit little slots very well once they chewed up	1
first this game downright frustrating maddening anyone any age . little practice strategy though it becomes easier lot more fun . though some pieces still little difficult but not too hard . course comes after playing game several times developing strategies how move pieces within their holes pick them up succesfully . so if you just thinkin you reach just take them out no strategy you wrong . so i difinetly don't recommend this younger kids . my 5 yr old niece only take out 3 pieces 12 which not very fun little kid . so if you're thinking buying this 6yr old kid forget it . i think this game should rated older kids because it too dificult young kids . reason i put two stars educational your kids come up strategies remove pieces successfully . also your kids learn parts anatomy like elbow , knee , shoulder etc . this game fun older kids but younger kids such my niece it may too difficult even several games practice . therefore i would only recommend it older kids adults .	1
my three younger children really enjoyed this game-it easy understand fun play ... there several ways play game so it adds variety also . great homeschooling , also educational game playing .	1

( more so than we expected ) our daughter 6 . she crazy elmo ( so am i , i must admit -- he much better than barney or teletubbies ! ) i know she want hold onto him long time . you find him her bed or floor her sitting or lying top him like pillow . he pretty sturdy . it great , unique present any one who loves elmo . if you want something special really gets wow ! 3 foot elmo your man . i also hunted all over net say this excellent price . don't get him confused really cheapo version fisher price ( fisher price elmo doll so poorly made . it cheap ugly ) gund one made out really nice fabric much bigger . i give this thumbs up all around quality - looks price	1
my daughter received this doll house christmas . my husband i tried unsuccessfully assemble it . this not project beginners ! we now hired someone who hopefully follow directions assemble it . person who bought it thought it came all paint , accessories , etc . it just box full plywood sheets . we very disappointed this product	-1
when it positioned your layout , it makes bright , orange underpass , but using it it intended purpose bit troublesome . little gray cement barrels don't always fall down when you press top , it gets my kids frustrated they bang it several times . also , unless you position cement truck just right minute position , you not going get cement piece into back it , it extremely fine fit . gate arm same used toll booth bridge , it horrible . most time , it doesn't work , rest time , you use extreme pressure your finger ( hard even adult ) get it work . forget your kids enough strength press it . 2 little cement barrels pretty small , bound get lost , then this thing serves no purpose . but , like i said , it looks nice big , orange tunnel !	1
my grand daughter loves her tonka dump truck . she put lot her toys it , then dump them out ... over over !!! truck durable fun . great buy	1
this ball fun . my 7 month old likes watch this thing go . one problem we it though when it lands number 2 , which square , it sometimes gets stuck there can't get moving again it own . you hear it trying go but it can't get off 2 without little help	1
while table looks nice enough yourself favor avoid this . assembly process nightmare you find yourself spending hours just trying get long screws ( there many too so prepared)to fit into nuts you also situate into cheap wooden frame . screws much my shock not thread into supplied nuts you now buried 3/4 inch into frame . no matter how much you turn them tweak nuts inside frame they often fail catch . you find yourself taking whole sides off just because other side would not latch due this . it looks like they packed thing box overlooked assembly process . if you hours nd hours waste this than buy it . product looks decent enough . myself i never saw it . it pieces all over floor nuts bolts everywhere . i could went home depo picked up countless screws slammed thing together somehow but this point i disgusted whole thing . avoid this buy something else	1
i just watch where they playing it , avoid water mess carpet . but they love it . i wish it came color , though . our girls light skin dark eyes hair , so it would nice find doll looks like all these neat things too . because , we don't want blonde looking doll , folks wonder why we bought them black looking doll , cause it darker than " you me " doll toys us , we also bought them	1
if your child enjoys acting out thomas friends series , then they should know emily one friendlier engines . she old-fashioned engine , large inner wheels . she first female steam engine , apart lady , who only appeared thomas magic railroad movie . she given 2 green coaches after saving oliver toad when they stuck tracks . before she her coaches , she borrowed annie clarabelle thomas , which made all other engines sad . emily just released last year " emily new coaches " already , she major role , mainly because thomas friends doesn't show female engines very often . i recommended learning curve sells emily coaches , because i don't think thomas approve emily always taking annie clarabelle	1
we bought blue her friends my dauhgter second birthday . she loves them . she carry them around her . definatley good buy if your child loves blue	1

there 3 new tool tech figures pull string motorized action : billly , jake justice , jack hammer . these new tools replaced heavy , chunky , battery operated powermax tools , but perform same actions , cut down few dollars cost . only downside plastic axe chopping tool very thin , durability becomes question . however , we've it while it keeps working hasn't broke yet . i just don't think it hold up much abuse old powermax tools	1
i am hooked whole shout ... series . it extremely fun play friends family . only downside if you played any other discs , they use same movies , singers , etc all discs . they just use different scenes , etc . but it still good game own .	1
if you're movie buff or just watch lot movies then this game you . best part this game somehow it keeps track score you . it fun , competitive game , extremely portable	1
anagramania , karmel games , fun new twist victorian parlor game which usually called " anagrams " . there three available editions game , junior , intermediate advanced . we found junior good place start get hang game , but quickly stepped up intermediate . i haven't played advanced , but judging difficulty intermediate , i think it probably pretty tough . stefan fatsis book " word freak " , competitive scrabble circuit , he described how expert scrabble players often quiz each other anagrams , giving all letters 15-letter word seeing who unscramble them first . any scrabble player moving into competitive circuit , i recommend this game practicing your anagrams getting hang art unscrambling . this game not just warm-up excersize scrabblers , though , it plenty fun its own ! play junior version your kids practice their spelling get them think words phonemes abstract way . play one tougher editions adult party game intellectual challenge . it very versatile very fun	1
robot i purchased very well made action walking , spinning , shooting very cool ... this very good collectable good price !! i say this my second purchase amazon , nothing but but professional ..... thanks ..	1
snorta fun game if you company outgoing , loud people . if not , everyone just sits around making lackluster animal noises actually sound like animals . overall entertaining party game	1
we pleasantly surprised flat-screen lite brite . my 4-yr-old quite enthralled . it great fine-motor it quite entertaining . complaints : storage drawer works ( barely ) but it sticks - it quite hard open close . i wouldn't surprised if it breaks soon . also , i dismayed templates single-use only . i don't know if i'd purchased it , if i'd known . i assumed they would multi-use . i'd love find some sesame street , dora or backyardigan design sheets out there ! i've hunting around web haven't seen too many interest	1
regards review above , it friggin doll . it cabbage patch kid . they look like cartoon kids anyways . if you wanted realistic asian-looking doll , there plenty them market . i sure hope nobody buys cabbage patch kid doll hoping it'll either 1 ) look like their kid , 2 ) look realistic or 3 ) represent necessarily what people __________ race should look like . if makers cabbage patch kids made kid entirely slanty eyes , i'm sure people would felt it racist . they made it similarly they could others added dark straight hair bit almond shape end eyes , unlike non-asian dolls . little kids love dolls typically regardless what they look like . getting adopted asian child asian doll isn't going get her " touch " her asian culture . i hope you other plans than . comment amazon.com service , i no problem ordering them . i typically get my orders mail earlier than expected . maybe there complications related your order various reasons	1
children really love action . amount track comes wiith set very good opens up new different layouts . smoking train safe . light spray water there no danger harm or fire . children got kick out sprayed water . not enough cause water problems , but it looks good	1

this ride very disappointing ! this gift my son 3 year birthday . his grandparents bought train extra track we set it up surprise his thomas party . we made childsize railroad signs , sir topham hatt harold flying over train track . he own island sodor . but none children party , including my son , could hold down handle keep train moving . couple children got their foot stuck when train would go around turns . huge waste money ! we returned it after 2 weeks aggrivation . it should peddle like other battery power vehicles , he no problem driving his truck he received his 2nd birthday .	-1
i bought it because it sale i thought it would cute party even if it didn't last too long . after reading comments battery getting wet , i put two layers strapping tape over battery compartment keep it dry before i used it first time seeems worked . i put fish pool start pool birthday party my nine year old daughter it big hit . some girls swam around it most evening . they weren't exactly gentle , either . they grabbed it pulled it under several times . they water three hours but next day i realized we didn't get fish out . i found it partially submerged skimmer basket . i shook it out tried it swim event it still swims .	1
i 6 these now they great . kids love swim them but we also use them decoration backyard barbeques . they look real look wonderful pool . great pool toy !	1
this very nice looking sturdy stool . it also very easy put together . i gave it 4 stars because i'm using it wood floor it slips unless i super glue rubber band strips bottom	1

second time , i'll send my husband store get new one ! i wouldn't even bother , but my 2 year old completely enamored this toy . he absolutely loves him . arm movement me not issue ; it no longer sing or talk all . it just makes strange clicking sound when it moves . this 2nd time this happened ! my son extremely upset his beloved " planenman " " broke " " mommy fix . " unfortunately , mommy could not fix ( even though i replaced batteries ) . i wrote hasbro first time it happened , hoping they could offer me solution or some offer replacement . i heard nothing them . so i just my husband pick up one . 2 weeks ago . now , just 30 minutes ago , 2nd spiderman won't sing or talk . i'm my wit end . guess what i'm going ? buy one , bring it home , return defective one new box receipt store ! ( don't worry ; i'll tell them it broken so some other child doesn't get it . ) dishonest ? perhaps little . but so selling defective toys kids ..	1
i purchased itsy bitsy spider man my 15 month old nephew christmas , he loves it . it easy him operate , so he plays spidey songs dances over over . i highly recommend it give it four stars only because it would cooler if there more than two songs . overall , great toy toddler boys	1
my 2-year old grandson delighted spider-man doll he received xmas continues play ( dance ) doll	1
i bought this my grandson . it still working after few uses . it moves around pool cute watch , but that all i say it .	1
it very nice last summer . i put it away after thoroughly drying it out ( 5 other swimways fish ) . this summer when i opened them up put batteries only one worked . others simply dead now trash . if you looking one-season toy , then this fun , but if next summer comes around you probably find they don't work	-1
my daughter received this set christmas gift . i going return it because i already purchased graco set . we decided keep it because we two little girls figured two different patterns would great . i must say , cabbage patch set very well made . quilting design nicely it looks like it going hold up really well . best part it diaper bag . this bag converts into changing pad opening it up . when open , it maintains main pocket everything placed into . this seems logical i know , but graco bag when it opened opens into one flat piece . it not keep any pocket , so whatever bag goes all over place . all all , we one each set my girls love them both . i just think cabbage patch one ( i admit this grudgingly ) little better designed . i highly recommend it . only possible downside older child might find pattern too babyish . us , it great . it greatly increased amount time my girls play their dolls because it gives them way really feel responsible . they understand concept diaper bags , etc . relate . ability take care their babies somehow changed babies toy gets tossed after little playtime into more member family . we can't leave house without them now . anyway , great set ... we love it	1
i really love melissa doug wood puzzles , we own many , so i bought two these boxes order store them better . i didn't realize until it arrived , md chunky piece puzzles not fit due puzzle pieces too thick sitting too close edges puzzle . most puzzles we own chunky piece puzzles , so rather disappointing , but i am sure we aquire many fit years come . now if md made sure all their chunky puzzle pieces sat inch border puzzle , then they would fit , but they not designed way currently - maybe future ! otherwise , great storage solution	1

i played this game few times over years , it fun , but not exactly something i felt compelled own . many years later , i came across jenga again , but this time it combined horror/suspense role-playing game . if you like playing rpgs , but don't like held down stats , die rolls , rules , i'd suggest checking out dread rpg impossible dream ( tiltingatwindmills.net ) . whereas other horror suspense rpgs , you say " my character feeling scared " , dread , you look swaying tower feel scared your character . now jenga game " must-have " my game closet	1
this era mobile psps , x-boxes gamecubes , classic game like jenga not only continues survive , but thrive ! my first experience my 2 nieces . i never seen them before since it always snows mi , we couldn't go out . break awkward silence pass time , my 4 year old pulled this tower fun out . next several hours we played this awsome game bonded each other . it most fun i kids . ok , now specifics . game works first arranging all pieces make tower then making each person pull out one piece time put it top tower . simple huh ? well i said it easy learn but idea select piece pulled out without causing collapse this where men separated boys ( boys usually win ! ) . you actually learn strategize your game pull each piece sequence make your tower taller . each piece made wood right size , finish weight support quite bit weight . if you looking game doesn't entail mindless button pushing or shooting those ugly monstors tv screen , go this one . your kids love it hopefully you too	1

my son got this gift his birthday . parents bought it didn't realize action figures not included . i most area bix box retail places no one sells them . very useless toy without figurines . i am taking one more day look them , if no luck , it boxed up returned . this probably one worst marketing schemes i seen where toys concerned . how crappy sell dueling playset no people duel . very very stupid my opinion .	1

my 2-year old received this present his birthday absolutely loves it ! but so my 5-year old boy so they fight over it . only problem this toy no other cars fit it ... none matchbox cars or any die-cast cars cars ... they always get caught around curves . needless say , 2 cars came product long lost , so it sits shelf unused right now . i just ordered 2 sets replacement cars $4/set [ ... ] . so i look forward both them set cars race down now	1

i bought this toy my 2 grandchildren , ages 3 7 . so far they love it . granted , my 7 yr old barely able fit it it won't long before he outgrows toy ( he wants know why they can't make it bigger ) . my three year old ball , especially " simon says " feature . i agree it not work well carpet . it tends slow down spinning , but all all , both kids love it !	1
smaller size than what i remember one my adult children some 30 years ago . grandkids love interactive game option . 33 year old daughter admitted her sit'n spin one her favorite toys	1
i first purchased havoc heli ( smaller cousin reflex ) very impressed even it limited control ability so i decided purchase reflex . i returned it next day but am still very pleased havoc . neither " real " rc choppers they don't use manipulation angle blades directional control ( not sure what technical term this . ) therefore limited maneuverability . reflex uses main blades hover 2 small fans either side provide directional changes . main problem reflex it always drifts one side ( not related adjusting trim manual states this drifting occur ) if you happen make turn direction unit drifting it sends unit careening out control into nearest obstacle . directional control stick not analog doesn't allow degrees motion but merely on/off click one four directions time making it very difficult control . i would highly recommend havoc heli ( again , smaller cousin reflex ) it great value it low price ( though it takes some getting used ) but those looking more fulfilling ( or outdoor ) rc chopper experience you should go your local hobby shop invest real fully functional rc chopper ( which purchased around $200 all accessories included most shops ) skip reflex heli . it not worth significant price increase over havoc heli .	1
this toy great i love webkinz . when you adopt webkinz you go ww [ ... ] enter code access webkinz world . webkinz world so much fun . you start off 2,000 kinzcash . you get play games earn kinzcash you spend it your pet . everything you need shop . you buy food , clothes , furniture , more ! arcade games so much fun . my favorite candy bash . also you go tournament arena vs other webkinz players . also you answer trivia quizzy question corner . also , there curio shop where you search gems . you also shop there , rare items available there . funnest part i think decorating your house . you also chat friends using kinzchat so no personal information given . then , webkinz newspaper which you read . also , if your pet gets sick or it needs checkup you go clinic . there so much you i can't list it all ! only problem webkinz recently prices going way up they too much money ! i bought my pink poodle 10 dollars march but now same one 30 bucks ! it very unreasonable . so i can't get one because they cost too much . overall , if you get better deal webkinz would great . i bet you or your kid would love it	1

great figure . it huge ! little details pretty sweet megatron gun scope , silencer , arm rest comes off vents prime legs open when he steps stuff . his mouth moves when you push button back his head ! matrix leadership cool well . it heavy too ! good solid construction die-cast parts . even after my 3 year old played it i wasn't too nervous it breaking ( like i would if it plastic ) . robot mode best . great articulation . all five fingers move ... wrist screens pop up megatron grimlock pictures . display stand talks makes classic transforming sound ( it not peter cullen voice exactly but it close enough ) . truck mode step down detail alternators but it still looks like classic truck . spring suspension rubber tires great . amazon best price . like $49.99 + free shipping . that $20 cheaper than anywhere else . it great addition my collection looks great my shelf next my lego yoda statue ( they're same height ! )	1

i originally bought this game something different play our grandchildren , ages 13 - 26 . they loved it couldn't stop talking quelf . they loved randomness game you couldn't predict what you going asked - they loved my version " chicken dance " . this christmas , i gave one game each family we hit christmas .	1
my family concluded our first annual thanksgiving game quelf , i surveyed table . my mother , who turns seventy this year , belt tied around her head ( look like ninja , course ) . my father , seventy-four , sock coming out his shirt collar his shoelaces tied together . my sister , thirty-nine , wearing bike helmet ( card called anything chinstrap ) , her pajama sleeves hung loosely her sides ( card informed her she now " armless " - we roll die her after ) . who these people ? i known them all my life , yet throughout this spirited game i witnessed surprisingly novel actions : my mother pantomiming she wearing flippers snorkel while attacked swarm bees . my father , physician , delivering moving eulogy his fictitious dog " scooter , " who , according instructions card , affinity coleslaw delighted playing large land mammals . never i seen my sister slap herself face , turn me yell " you must not defy king ! " four us agreed we never laughed so hard , or so consistently , we during hour play . i admit , i skeptical before purchase . after reading some reviews viewing pictures box online , it first seemed if quelf some sort wacky game needs certain setting , mood , or substance related enhancement order fully appreciated . this not case . there elements game , such trivia category parts , help quelf maintain its flow keep players grounded authentic board-game style competition ... this game sucks you then absolutely hammers you random acts creativity humor . player age , gender , personality non-factors . quelf uncanny capacity drawing out best ( " best " , i mean ability make other people laugh until they nearly soil themselves ) anyone .	1
i feel this costume overpriced quality . it not just like picture not really good quality . said , my grandson not take it off loves it . i guess what this all . thanks , ruth pose	1

executive summary this game very much like kerplunk old , lot fun . those you who never played any kerplunk simple theme place plastic sticks across game web , dump bunch marbles top web , then start removing sticks one time . obviously , person fewest marbles fall , wins . this newer version kerplunk adds 2nd level placing plastic sticks into yet web . this adds some game , however practice , most marbles not fall until you begin pulling sticks this 2nd level . one comment related my kids . my kids both 5 , they place most sticks holes make web , however web filled , it gets harder harder push them ( plastic sticks need bend if you want all sticks ) - needs big kid help :-) overall , this simply fun game inexpensive price	1
my son got this birthday present . after taking quite while set up , several cheap flimsy sticks breaking , game lasted but few minutes . since no one wanted take time set it up again , it got tossed . save your money ! buy blink !	-1
i love this but it shoots out marble too hard . it bounces offthe track . but its really fun shoot it too hard because you get run after it	1
this toy must !!! my daughter loves it !! we got it her little after her first birthday now year later it still one favorites . i actually bought one each grandparents house !!	1
these great -- fun kids play , easy clean up . absolutely my daughter favorite bath toy ever	1
kid opened it , pulled everything out , completely unimpressed , never play it . this 9-year old boy who likes putting stuff together likes science-kinda stuff , so he target audience this toy . if i guess , i would guess poor packaging put him off . it very bland boring doesn't look like it would fun all , judging box . if it colorful action people pictures , fun set directions , my guess would he would far more interested . it , though , nothing . fair , my coworker recommended this gift item -- he used one kid loved playing it . different strokes , go figure	1
i gave this " paint wild " set my 12 year old daughter . she loved it . she enjoyed painting all horses making them her own . she gave two out gifts family members christmas ornaments . our family loved getting hand painted horse hang their tree . i am looking more kits her paint . they make great birthday presents too ! if your child likes crafts this kit you .	1
i bought this kit my niece who 11 . she really enjoyed painting horses she loves horses crafts , so combination fantastic . i think kit great fun most children , but i little suprised how little there kit . my only complaint these horses very fragile broken easily . she broke one hers why painting it , broke already right out box . i would reccomend you keep mind when purchasing it . make sure kids very careful them , you might want inspect box before giving it them . all all , great craft kit my opinion	-1
this good game husbands wives play team . multiple choice options so " out there " you rarely know answer any way ! you find yourself using logic talking though situations your partner eliminate choices . you don't play teams , but we found fun . we alos altered scoring , because way directions ouline makes quite long game	1
if i could give this zero stars i would -- honestly , it deserves negative amount stars . lots people saying this game bad because many answers cards incorrect . major problem right there ! but regardless , this game terrible anyway . my husband i got it wedding present it highly recommended some friends ours . that last time i'll take their advice sure ! only people who would enjoy this , my opinion , people who enjoy watching paint dry . most boring game world ! all you take turns reading multiple choice questions -- most them aren't even interesting . not waste your money	-1

my family i love play board card games weekly basis . i am always lookout new games play . while barnes noble i found this game 10 bucks it looked fun educational . what i found this most fun card game i played since phase 10 ! anyone children adults play suceed this game . you start picking 5 cards per person . these cards nouns them such " car , boat , woman , spider , church , student , toy , universe " then you play 4 cards middle all players . you must lay card one 4 main cards . card you play either fit or object card middle . example : 4 cards middle " bus , baby , house , car " i " nursery , finger , spiderweb , thief , black hole " my hand . i play " nursery " top " baby " . baby goes into nursery . next card you play ... nursery would fit or card ( church , house , etc , nursery church ) you go until no one play bigger card person who played biggest last card wins hand . kids , this teach them reading , definitions , different meanings same word , you validate why you played card other players they vote whether you play card or not . i so much fun this game you can't help but laugh when other players try validate completely idiotic card ! i recommend this game anyone 8 or older . i definitely keep this game our shelf long time	1
war ring may finest board game i ever owned ( i own many ) . if not , it certainly best war game . it not just tolkien fanatic my talking ; this some most fun unplugged gaming you . this primarily two player game , but up four play . one player/team plays free peoples middle earth ( rohan , gondor , north , elves , dwarves ) , other plays shadow ( sauron , isengard , southrons easterlins ) . there two win : military ring victories . ring victory means free peoples player need get fellowship mordor cast ring into mount doom , or shadow player need get 12 corruption points ring bearers . military victory means you need capture enemy settlements gain victory points ( 10 shadow , 4 free peoples ... it not easy it sounds ! ) . thing i like most this game it stays interesting through whole game . every turn exciting . this due core mechanic . each turn , players roll dice symbols them . each symbol gives player variety options they take die . players take turns choosing actions based what they rolled ( one time , so there hardly any player downtime ) . number options available would overwhelming , but game includes two reference sheets makes things very easy . all options you'd want war game based lotr here . game starts all nine companions fellowship , but you'll able break them up , so they persuade nations free peoples go war . which brings me political track . game starts each nation political position they books . companions activate them , using dice or attacked push them closer war . combat similar risk , but few added twists , such leaders , characters , defending strongholds . there alot going this game , but it all fun . far rules go , there really isn't anything brings game down . odds against free peoples , but it possible win . ( expansion fixes this ) but there flaws production presentation . rulebook itself somewhat confusing . not until you've finished reading it you understand things you read beginning . this cause your first few sessions " feeling it out " experience . pieces problem . all free peoples pieces either blue or grey , all shadow pieces orange . it difficult quick glance tell which piece belongs which nation . add insult injury , there colored borders around each nation , so it make you wonder why ffg just didn't mold them corresponding colored plastic . i ( many other players ) paint their pieces fix this . but again , none flaws found really bring game down long end . game total blast , 2-3 hours it takes just fly . every aspect intensely interesting , fun regardless who wins . aside afore mentioned problems , rest production presentation extremely high ( what else would you expect ffg ? ) tolkien fans , this must buy , but everyone else still find alot enjoy . i love this game , give it highest possible recommendation .	1
my 2 year old got this chirstmas so far so good . its very nice , pretty . its kinda pearly-pretty . plays three songs able just play keys . my 5 year old likes it too	1

we bought this dollhouse ( after much research ) our 3 1/2 year old daughter ! she loves it ! rooms big easy play decor overall adorable !! we knew no furniture available , so we filled it furniture twin time dollhouse ( girls bedroom , office , parent bedroom , living room , family room , laundry room) ! kitchen , nursery playroom already complete ! furniture works perfectly ! our daughter loves sounds when people placed certain chairs . i highly recommend this doll house over twin time doll house !	1

far card games go , this up top far fun goes . couple weeks after my first play i decided i buy my own copy . it good those who simply want make stupid sexual innuendo jokes or people who enjoy social card games . i would describe it western , stategy mofia ... good stuff	1
this clever very fun card game . only reason i gave it four because when character dies player out game entirely . even though expansion there card brings player back life but , only one turn . plus its only expansion pack . but anyway , unless you out very early game which happen , its very fun	1

we twins our side side stroller getting old . i found these got 2 umbrella strolllers attatched them together . they very easy put take off strollers . we much more room van also , they take up much less space than original double stroller . only complaint i after they hooked together rubber pieces come out i put them back each time i attach them stroller again . ( but it isn't so bad . i really hope you enjoy this product , we !!	1
i'm not sure if some negative reviews roundhouse here actually kid-tested because this piece my son favorite geotrax piece , hands down . sometimes he'll just play this piece itself . it 100% compatible all existing geotrax pieces . here pros cons : pros -- great " geo-motion " automated turntable coordinated crossing signals which direct engine into garage or let it continue straight through . -- equivalent length 4 or 5 straight tracks , so this big piece suitable straightaways . -- great features kids who want pretend park trains ( la thomas) -- typical durable geotrax quality detail -- cost , i think this one best piecescons -- i honestly don't	1
we're fans geotrax series , expecially geomotion pieces . however , roundhouse designed very poorly , if all . there several design flawas which cause major frustration kids , i'll just explain 2 main ones : 1 ) roundhouse 3 tracks leading up it ; two it pass straight through one road which perpendicular . if train exits through perpendicular road , since roundhouse track facing direction , it cannot came back around enter through straight road ; same true if it exits via straight side . furthering this problem there no manual crank rotate roundhouse track correct port , so even if you wanted manually turn track accept train , you can't . train gets jammed up kids get frustrated . 2 ) many kits , including main set include additional cars aside lead engine . they attached behind lead . you cannot use train any length if you want it fit roundhouse - all cars must removed otherwise track gets jammed up when roundhouse tries rotate other cars attached behind non-rotating track . conecpt may good , but implementation horrible makes this worst toy my kids got last year . furthering problem , i can't take it back since it doesn't dissasemble	-1
i bought this because i love this episode simpsons . whats cool this you turn wheel back toy homer actually eats donuts , his mouth opens donuts fall his mouth . my son i laughed our tails off	1
although my granddaughter enjoyed playing dress up this product i don't think it worth nearly $50.00 i paid .	1
i purchased this " grand daddy " lincoln log set my 4 6 year old . i debated spending so much money , but it well worth it get " real " lincoln logs so many pieces them work . they make least 3 full structures set . storage case great storage , however little heavy side , but hasn't stopped my kids dragging them out play . because their ease , my kids feel so proud after they built ' homes ' complete chimneys !!! i recommend them anyone child who loves create things their own ( sometimes little help too )	1
game little confusing first , however it easy figure out second time around . gatekeeper little loud but game really good fun keeps everyone their toes - game timed . i own it all five my children love game	1

we similair toy melissa doug ( i think ) doors latches , but ... this one so much more fun educational too ! it shape sorter , doors open close , latches my son hasn't even really played yet ! he loves pieces putting them holes , taking them out doors , etc ... i'm very sad hear other problems it ... we bought it my son christmas - he 9 months old , but 2 older brothers , so ... we little pieces everywhere , so we watch him most all time he plays ... we leave it floor not problem latches , doors , pieces , or weight ! but again i'm him or watching him when he plays ! ( but don't feel this toy unsafe - others our house yes ... ) this one toy i wish we gotten my first son - best shape sorter my opinion we 5 ! my 2 older kids play baby all time ! it definitely baby ( maybe 4 6 year olds too ! ) latches aren't any more dangerous than one melissa doug so ... maybe why 18+ months age range !?	1
concerns negative reviews , both them gave toy labeled 18+ months one-year-olds . my daughter 21 months , this currently her favorite toy . she mastered her other shape sorters , this gives extra challenge latches locks . difference motor skills 12 months 18 months great . don't buy this toy one-year-old	1
i bought my 5 year old son pirates play set . he loves every part toy . there plenty play set works great both star wars pirates dolls too . it really allows your child use his imagination	1
wow , i can't say enough good things this item . you must buy this yourself or it would make great gift . music calming not too loud . lights design adorable . it durable - my son turn three it still his room . plus batteries last long time . i think i've only changed them twice . when my son baby this toy would sit his swing he would stare it hit it make it play . definite good choice	1
i bought two these my twin grandchildren . wish i bought more $9.99 price i paid hand gifts . great sound very colorful	1
this one neatest toys our kids . it extremely durable fun kids all ages . only thing negative this toy it difficult set up . but once it set up , there no maintenance . worth expense !	1
i bought this toy 5 years ago my children their friends still go it first backyard . it fun , fast safe great exercise too . ours through wringer 5 children friends other than replacing pulleys after 4 years tightening cable it withstood elements . i would definitely buy this again	1
i bought one these albums my first granddaughter , felt my second should one well . we lived state time first purchase , so i concerned she know her extended family . even though family lives nearby now , it fun pictures people you know book . both girls love look pictures . this particular album good quality cloth , pictures secure book , babies love chew play attached rings	1
what neat book this one ! it little more difficult kindergartener but definitely get them started this book . it teaches such myriad things - particularly hand eye coordination . one games them driving batmobile through streets gotham city trap bad guys ( joker , etc . ) but if you slip up all accidentally get off road , game over bad guy gets away . it definitely takes some skill attention so if you're needing , sure grab this book . this one those books gets ton play our house i'm growing concerned i'll buy second one soon after this one wears out ! highly recommend	1
master replicas known producing movie replica props expanded out disney franchise pirates o caribbean coin set . there several pirates coins produced elsewhere but not near quality price offered licensed pieces . detailing quality really top notch this set . you won't go wrong getting one these sets value cost quite high . i understand they problems sword compass quality control , my personal experience other products poor . given , this item still one their best deals well worth purchasing while you find them .	1
my 2 yr old son received starter track christmas 2005 absolutely loved everything it ... sound effects , working stations course train(so my 6 yr old daughter ) . he so pleased we took some his extra christmas money purchased working barrel lifter loader , additional engine bridge set . extra pieces we purchased he loves this most . he can't wait train make it around lift barrels watch them roll down other side finally unload them it all over again . his eyes light up when he sees barrel actually carried up side like magic . i afraid it may little too advanced him load barrels upon opening package but he manages it quite well no assistance me . my husband i can't believe how well it built how much kids enjoyed playing it . all train sets i looked purchasing this set offers most .	1

this new low , even our feminazi-drenched anti-culture . whole message this whore doll tell impressionable little girls superficial , arrogant , shallow slutty positive attributes , desirable healthy , contrast , true strength character , integrity , honor modesty ' losers . ' other words , looking behaving like skank tramp = " empowerment . " term so misued over last 30 years ( particularly last 10 ) , it ceases any truth it whatsoever . barbie used epitomize what it meant feminine , lady , fulfilled -- husband , home children . now standard completely perverted ruined onset dolls like this -- exchanging true values ( good wife mother ) false ones ( materialism promiscuity ) . even barbie face uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out bratz dolls . realize -- this war our children souls ! mattel should ashamed themselves , hilt . this child abuse , pure simple . any mother who allows their child get one these monstrosities should jailed neglect her tubes tied	-1

this toy pretty easy assemble . it 35 pieces +7 ages . when i got this toy [ ] local ... store , it cool mini cd rom , but i doubt they make those anymore . coolest part set would either mask , or hooks . hooks used cling onto edgy cliffs , mask used breathe underwater . you go [ bionicle web site ] learn updates , bios , etc . great website toy . easy , fun , cheap ! =	1

if you looking inexpensive statue rock god . this one get . too sweet	1
we played this game family get together yesterday . it much too dry boring our family . we all intelligent people , but found this game laboring hard pronounce words obscure subjects . i guess if you enjoy slow moving trivia games , this would you	1
my kids played this almost every day since christmas . adults known pick it up play too ! only concerns i would mention : reload mechanism little hard my 4 year old use , i can't find anywhere buy extra darts . we lost one dart so far , i'm sure there more lost before summer . overall durable fun product	1
i purchased miele washing machine also miele stove christmas my 4 year old daughter . she absolutely loves them ! not one day goes she hasn't played them . i also bought small set steel pots pans fit stove . washing machine works water or without it not make mess if she uses it water . i am looking dishwasher fridge complete set	1

i'm agree most reviews . my niece saw commercial this really wanted it . my brother got it her birthday . it made spin master ltd . canadian toy manufacturer . it comes 3 beanie baby type bears , basically already made but no stuffing . fabric cheap delicate . one bear came 1 " rip it which my niece asked me sew up . operation success btw :) cute looking plastic mechanism you use stuff them cheaply made . zippers bears very bad tough . you stuff bear cotton only , therefore bear can't sit well like beanie baby . i recommend stuffing some beads his bottom . my mother said , " well price , you can't expect much toy like " maybe shes right , you decide . here jest toy : 1 . stuff bears w/cotton-like stuffing ( no beans/beads ) 2 . zip up bear your . 3 . most likely end up playing bears but tossing stuffer mechanism aside never use it again . toy would much better if it more inspired " build-a-bear workshop " allow us add choice eyes , nose , mouth ourselves . maybe some clothing too . i guess you get what you pay . but your better off purchasing craft kit make your own bears your child . much more interactive creative . or get some legos . legos plenty replay value you keep adding them forever . or spend day build-a-bear workshop . though it bit costly . :)	1
my two neices , ages 8 9 , received these christmas gifts they so excited get them they immediately opened them made three animals kits included could hardly wait use gift cards they received other family members go buy more kits ....	1
my mom got this my daughter this past christmas . upon opening little house bears came , i shocked just how much stuff came it . i didn't expect there 6 bears number one . number two , there actually enough stuffing fill all 6 them . it even came couple outfits bears . most shocking aparatus used put stuffing bears , actually works . you manually push stuffing down into arms legs , but i expected . turns out most important part this set up , key opens zipper back bear . you use key , or you not able open zipper . they anticipated zippers comming open , so they designed zipper not open unless opened this key . don't lose it , because zipper isn't comming down unless you key . we now ordering refills , we look forward doing it again . like little beany baby factory .	1
this one nicest doll sets i seen very long while . i really like they offering more than just caucasian version . they also this african american set ( awesome !!!! ) , hispanic set , asian set . now how cool ????? i give them all 5 big stars ! you get soooo many dolls each set each set so reasonably preiced ! i am ordering one each set ! this price how you go wrong ????? these sets wonderful . 5 big stars	1

this very good game . i started out shortz ' puzzles which why i bought this handheld . instructions stumped me day but since i paid $20.00 it , i decided call customer service numeber back book within 30 seconds i playing game . i no idea why they formatted gi gii figures all 8 . this what confusing . if you turn game it load screen all 8 . top , 8 form words g1 , then there space 8 form word gii . once you press set 8 form word gi , it take you first puzzle or you input puzzle number you want start . example if you want start puzzle number three then you enter 003 , if you wanted start puzzle 45 , then you enter 045 . if it puzzle 203 , then you enter 203 . once you've , then you press on/confirm button lower right hand side you're ready play . if you wasnt save or pause game then you'd press load/save button left . if anytime you want start game or redo one you're working , then you'd press undo/newgame button . it'll take you back gi/gii screen you just confirm game you want play . numbers 01 , 02 , 03 doesn't mean much far i tell . pressing any one take you same puzzle . i feel like i just wrote manual myself but i love this handheld i know game like this should not confusing , but once you know how operate it , it addictive books .	1
i think my mom likes these more than i !!	1
my son enjoyed auditory peek blocks when he under year , so i purchased this set when he bit older . i thought he would enjoy looking them since he absolutely loves any all types balls . well , instead looking them trying figure out how each ball moves inside , he just throws them . i could spent my $$ buying soft ball instead handing him hard block chunk across room	1

sometimes reviewers seem lack sense adventure . they surely know internet take them back history all over map ; thus , they easily discover lincoln logs honoring president abraham lincoln since 1916 /and/ continue win not only ' kid appeal ' but applause increasingly intergenerational group " toy connoisseurs " ! it happens i some ' grands ' could build right out their imaginations more convincing " prairie homestead " ~ but that what toys all , isn't it ? homestead comes bag horse some " real " cowboy types , reviewer mchaiku recommends you buy it /with/ stagecoach station in-a-can ! way , you all get down floor build this impressive two-story structure complete windows . . . or . . . you , reader , leave it kids use this great block time pursue your own back-log :~) reading : specifically , absorbing doris kearns goodwin book " team rivals : political genius abraham lincoln " ( isbn : 0684824906 ) ~ truly significant way celebrate president lincoln birthday .	1

... or you could get this now see tons footage return sith [ sic ] few weeks early . that really only reason i bought it , i not disappointed slightest . many questions form movie clip , there quite few questions episode 3 . none it 11/04 teaser trailer or regular trailer that out months . though if you really want see these clips , you're best off just playing dvds , rather than actually playing round after round tp them ..	1
my sons ( ages 2 3 ) received this tent christmas gift . they love using it their " hide-out " bad guys . however , rods used construct arches made wood . within first week , one rods broke splintered while boys playing . we tried fixing broken rod duct tape , but now rod won't bend very easily tent doesn't stay place it should . i wish arches made more flexible materials ( ' la pop-up tunnels tents ) so they could withstand normal play .	-1
this game my all time favorite ! my husband i play this game our children ages 16 , 12 8 . sometimes we play teams . it truly fun eductional .	1
i played this game years . it lot fun but my friends got tired it . i love fast passed action , which me less boring than scrabble , but not everyone thinks so . if you like scrabble you should enjoy this game . finding whom play different story . if you parent not hesitate purchase this game your child . i recommend scrabble dictionary close . if you you find out no time most your made-up words exist . since you not get penalties them try many you wish . game simple . you shake letter cubes when they all place you try make many words possible following continuous path through adjacent letters rack . ( diagonal counts adjacent ) path need not straight , but each letter path only used once . you three minutes ( sand clock included ) so . only words three letters or more permitted . you can't go wrong this game , plus it not expensive . it worth try . advanced players : if you look around you might find boggle master . edition 5x5 grid 9 more letter cubes . you still three minutes ( grid noisy ever ) but you make lot more points this one . happy hunting good luck .	1
if you just want expensive , cute little stuffed animal , all means buy away . if you looking nice place web your kids play , consider your kids may walk away very frustrated . there no way contact webkinz ( i find ) following issues : 1 ) your child use up half hour their alloted computer time just trying log webkinz . 2 ) there many error massages . most not make sense . webkinz technical support offers no support . it basically just blames any problem you your isp or your flash player not working ( even though it worked yesterday it work again tomorrow ) . 3 ) it sometimes logs your child out right middle game . my children simply stopped bothering webkinz lost interest their stuffed webkinz toys .	-1
this toy very cute but it stopped working after one week . handle also very hard turn get music play . this real waste money	-1
whole alphabet there 2 . this allows plenty letters teach your littles ones their letters , how spell their names and/or just teaching them words start learning how read . this toy better when playing it your child than him/her trying play their own . yet , what child remember their life - interaction their parents	1
my 4 year old little pony fanatic . we bought this her within 30 minutes crank broken . she not over turn it or mistreat this toy . i playing her when it broke . it impossible fix , my husband i tried twice it still won't work properly . cute this little playset , it not worth wasting money .	-1
don't waste your money this toy - it broke within first 5 minutes out box . it poor design hasbro not standing behind their product . twirling mechanism broke this toy 5 minutes out box . handle popped apart reveal small cog , screw metal spring . needless say , my daughter disappointed since " twirling handle " main function toy . i called hasbro they said " box it up " send it them so they could look it . so not only thing break but we deal hassle shipping it hasbro . customer service not very helpful . i asked them just replace broken toy - they would only if i would ship broken one them . we very dissatisfied this product fact hasbro not standing behind quality their products .	-1
we purchased this toy my 3 year old daughter . she absolutely loves it-it one her favorite birthday presents . all her little friends loved it too . it very sturdy product-my only complaint would cinderella arm come off few times , however it snaps easily back . songs very nice it volume control , which handy . i think this great product use introduce violin young girls	1
my daughter(then 5 ) really wanted violin christmas . we already firstact accordian which she loved . this , however , she not . i can't even make music using stick . heart front button you push down make music " beat prerecorded song " it impossible make song sound good even when using your hand . stick practically useless ( except weapon . ) kids usually just it play its own . everyone got sick three recorded songs very quickly . little princess front moves music ( first day ) she then fell off broke . kids played it few days , but it over year no one asked play it ... even when i take it out display it . big waste money	-1
i enjoyed reading other two reviews . it fun hear other little ones love this little stuffed pig much my 19 month old little girl . catherine picked it out when we vacation last summer it her constant companion ever since . like other two reviewers , i decided order second piggy . we almost lost piggy target other day when she asleep i'm not sure what we would . thank goodness 19 month old good eye her favorite stuffed animal kindness stranger seeing ground picking it up .	1

my daughter wanted movie soo bad christmas well doll . i saw black doll thought ... it good choice her my daughter same race . doll lot dances work promised . i'd recommend this doll any lil princess regardless which kind . sound little muffled so i don't suggest tv or anything too loud . nonetheless worth money	1

my son got these cars his first christmas when he 6months old . he now 18 months still plays these cars lot . fact , he his older brother ( 4 ) races cars . they soft , durable propel themselves . they also just right size - small enough hold but big enough not choking hazard . i given these cars gifts would so again future	1
we got one these our two-month old she just loves it ! you can't tell picture , but black lines toy stretchy ! it great gripping not too heavy ( our two month old hold it!)it worth every penny !	1
i put this rocket together w/ my 6 year old son fun project backyard . i very disappointed w/ construction . we put it together , i skeptical whether we would get more than couple launches out it . when we finally launched it , we couple premature misfires because i not put stopper tight enough giving us bit vinegar shower . we finally got stopper correct only see plastic bottle blast off leave fins behind . mylar tape failed stick after getting wet w/ vinegar . since this adult supervised activity anyway , we gone back estes rockets i flew kid w/ lot more success	-1
i used think ty made good toys ... but i wrong this one ! " fur " really weird material ( not plush ! ) awful " tacky " feel it makes it creepy touch makes toy look worn out old already . but even worse all blue spots actually painted ! you feel where paint dried it truly gross . i wouldn't recommend this toy , especially not give child . i yet decide if i should throw it into wash or throw it away altogether ! yuck	-1
our whole family loves this one . yes , volume loud but simply taping index card over speaker it muffled still understood perfectly , really . i found it loud first but we don't even use cover anymore now we two little boys house . product loaded information each planet giving kids choices find out history , distance sun , size , gravity/mass , year/day , temperature , space visits , moons , other fun facts each planet . they also make it easy child understand often making comparisons earth . anytime child may choose listen something else simply pressing easy use flat touch pad which plastic easy clean . when talking planet or moon picture lights up . if child chooses quiz his or herself gets answer wrong product correct them ask them again it seems within 10 or less questions . this product also happens lightweight , durable , easy clean if needed . it worth mentioning this product interface easier use than leappad . my boy already very interested solar system but this took it level fascination .	1

fun game family ( 10 up ? ) . mostly good mix randomness strategy . first it seemed too random my competitive nature , but once we really understood game , more strategies became apparent . i'd guess ages 10 up would enjoy , perhaps some younger kids too . i don't think i'd enjoy playing younger kids though because it long game ( least hour ) i play win . my son 13 handle ( beat me )	1

battery-powered thomas now replaced our 10-year old " sit-'n-spin " most-played toy our 3 daughters . we bought new thomas replace our old one , which endured trip through our daughter hair ( cut out never quite same ) swim toilet . old model went forward backwards ( cool ! ) but switch very difficult toddlers ' fingers manipulate ( not cool ) . new thomas goes forward only , but on/off button very easy use . we problems thomas . sometimes he just dies , then miraculously begins working later . also , since new thomas headlight ( cool ! ) , he battery junkie ( not cool ) . it common us go through battery every day . i now keep rechargeable batteries ready , i'm sick funding thomas ' indulgences . thomas jump track more often than he should , but doesn't seem upset our kids , therefore i don't care . problems prevent me awarding thomas 5 stars , but his popularity our kids earns him 4 stars . said , i'm going follow through one other reviewer suggestions buy brio engine next .	1
my son such great time first day then we change battery next day because it drained very quickly . i keep explaining my son , age 2 , it not good push it manually , because everyone else complained i worried clicking . we decided maybe take engine away until he bit older just let him track other non battery opperated car came it ( mine sir topham hatt set ) . but it too late unfortunately my son managed break it . he pushed down it make it go manually i think , bent wheel , or axel ? now it gets stuck back wheels stick don't move even slightest pressure . i works but not well . i think unless your child old enough just sit watch thing go round round keep wheels clean , it best buy non battery powered engines .	1

this game highly addictive . i got this christmas we played it non-stop whole weekend . many different cards ways gain points make this game little more complex than board game . after playing it couple times , you get hang strategies needed win pick it up pretty easily .	1
my daughter so excited when we brought out her special table chair plays it daily . it become spot doing puzzles , coloring , feeding her babies general play . it small enough she move chair table around herself , but sturdy enough she can't lot damage it either . all all , we very pleased this set	1
this table chair durable , classic , sturdy , " ergonomically correct . " best , there no assembly required ! chair came right out box , table only required me screw legs hand . it took two minutes . my daughter loves " cut out " her tummy well high back chair [ plus easy-to-carry feature ] . she enjoys drawing , tea parties her dolls , snacking this table ; so far it resisted all her climbing moving . i heartily recommend this product .	1

my son this toy when he only 6 months old ( christmas present ) he loves it ! he hasn't masted fact he should push down smokestack make it go , vs just spinning part train make noise , so right now it toy we both share . even my 3 4 year old niece nephew liked this toy	1
my 5 yr old daughter given this game gift . party they opened it played . all kids blast . you draw cards hop your bunnies hole hole . someone may draw spin carrot card . they spin carrot different hole opens up someone bunny may fall under hill . they can't wait spin see if someone falls . it says age 5 up but my three yr old plays her sister . if they count , they play . great fun !	1
my sister i ( both adults ) buy interesting card games play road or home when we want something , but just don't want spend hours playing other games . frog juice surprisingly fun . it little bit like rummy . it takes 20 minutes . older players i reccomend combining 2 decks keep things more interesting . otherwise spell ingredients get used up too quickly .	1
i agree all reviewers above . my 6 1/2-year-old 1st grade son adores this game . he needs use addition 12 developed planning skills . he picked up rules or more quickly than i . he now thinks his discards thinking strategically . game fun combination luck skill , great starting point young game fans . long your child basic addition , s/he should fine . importantly , it game parents enjoy playing too !	1
i orignal version this game when i little kid growing up . it great way while away hours long car trips or rainy day . i must say i'm really impressed mattel preserved authenticity game right down color casing , buttons sounds . those you who chasing your long-gone youth like i am , this great throw-back era . i highly recommend it	1
my grandson 7 years old . he loves game . whole family played it it enjoyed everyone . recommend it .	1
it nice educational puzzle more patient kids . reviewer said pieces weren't interlocking , so i warned , but i completely missed significance . bottom line pieces mostly cut shapes states , not lock together like traditional puzzle . it takes pretty delicate handling keep accidentally knocking states out alignment . positive side , pieces sturdy there none puzzle dust usually falls out	1
i don't know how they sell this so inexpensively , this puzzle very high quality would very beneficial kids all ages who need learn more us geography . i surprised how much my nephew enjoyed it , even though he just six years old	1
hands down game lasted generations . originally created 1960 , it so much fun it remained toy store shelves family rooms since . it seemed when i growing up my parents always included least one game when we children . hands down game left santa claus one year . my younger brother i looked box , we wondered if it dud or if it would really cool game play . we found it blast , especially if we could talk someone else into playing us . hands down cross card game board game . there slapping machine ( which lever facing each four players ) make sturdy plastic . when lever pushed down , plastic hand same color lever goes down card , which placed middle machine . luckily most parents this machine already put together so there no assembly nightmare ! deck cards other component this game . play begins each player choosing colored hand ( blue , green , yellow or red ) . then cards dealt - each player receives four cards remaining cards placed face down " draw " pile . each player takes turns drawing card pile - if you get match , you slap your colored hand down . last person slap gets one his cards taken first person slapped . slapping machine decides order because lever colored hand color coordinated " hands " lay top each other order they depressed . so colored hand top one who gets card taken away . here tricky part - if you draw card it doesn't match , you fake out your opponents pretend slap machine . if one other players slaps machine , then you succeeded faking them out get draw card them . boy my brother good faking everyone out - he master faker ! card taken one who faked out placed bottom draw pile . winner one most matches end game . end game when there no more cards draw pile . but let us not forget those special cards added keep game interesting . happy joker card wild card matched any other card form pair . sad joker card cost you points end game , so if you it , hope someone draws it out your hand ! simple game concept fun but get quite loud . when you're slapping machine , laughing , yelling carrying , neighbors hear you times . if you don't mind high noise level want play game children young six-years-old play ( but older " kids " like it too ! ) , then this game you ! if you quick reflexes you might even hands down champion !	1

everyone who plays this game says same thing : it masterpiece , it intriguing , it fun . there palatable depth game , too , opens up after few sittings . it quick simple setup - you turn off tv play round before bed . if you critical game , two things stand out . playing cards not laminated , which could taken lack quality construction . exploration theme game mostly irrelevant . players could just well building skyscrapers . neither my wife nor i found these ( 2 ) items issue . if you're looking unique challenging game play your husband or wife , then lost cities worth your money .	1

visualeyes , " what you see what you get " game . it dice game , sort . roll out large picture dice ( assembly required - possible " con " some homes , but big " pro " here - those my husband favorite words ! ) , try find 2-word phrases or compound words appear any pair dice . example , if you see 18 picture dice , one shoe horse , you might call out " horse shoe . " each die more than one interpretation . there die picture parent child next ruler one side , you could use it big , little , tall , short , measure , probably dozen other words picture . you could combine any those words any other pictures ... phrases anything common or known ( majority rules ) . possibilities endless . so far , we've only this game three days , it played kids adults , male female , pairs groups up 6 people . there no need " adjust " younger players . it always fun !	1

when my soon 6 yr old wanted this , i thought , oh now , $15 piece junk . i got it him after month him never forgetting he wanted it . 2 minutes out box , both he his 7 yr old brother ( both who completely different tastes toys ideas fun ) thier bellys floor playing thing . first 3 days straight , they nothing but play doodle doug his stamps . 2 weeks later they still love him but markers gone dry . i find more . how it works ! they've used appx 40 pages my printer paper . each one they fiddled button bottom made completely different designs it . i not see " messy " designs . i didn't find pens skipped or looked bad all . they look pretty close spirograph pictures old me . nice patterns different shapes . this my 1st review far i remember , that how impressed i this $15 toy . this first toy actually what commercial showed my boys both love it . ( also 13 yr old daughter who tinkers it ! )as " messy lines " people say it puts out ( guess i lucky , ours makes great lines patterns ) , while i wouldn't care what it looked like , isn't idea toys kids enjoy it ? not make masterpieces ? so , i give it 2 thumbs up price , keeping kids attention more then 5 minutes ( i've tossed many $50+ toy ended up junk ) ... oh joy ... actually doing what commercial says it	1
when i ordered this barbie , one navy blue dress shown , but instead one light blue dress showed up . she not look much better than off brand dollar store barbie , mattel should ashamed put out such low quality holiday angel barbie . general , their angel barbies stunning but this one stop short her thin wings ( looks like cardboard back ) , her hair mess , her dress so simple . her make-up simple well . also , she seems just stare off into space . i very disappointed this purchase . update ( 1/4/06 ) since writing this review playing barbie my daughter least once day , i found myself more often than not choosing this barbie mine when we play . i become fond her face even though first i not like it since it not what i expecting . it very nostalgic older style barbies , wider than it appears this listing . i also love way her arms pivot unlike some specific barbie dolls . her hair still messier than normal barbie , but i grown really like dress although wings hard stay despite velcro . i would recommend purchasing her simply because this unusual barbie mattel put out she add some diversity your collection .	1
i big pac-man fan growing up ( still am , i guess ) , so i very excited getting this play-at-home version . graphics , sounds overall game exactly i remember them , definitely not bad remake . but ... joystick , or how it connected software really aweful . 1 out 5 times you press joystick certain direction , game simply doesn't respond . ghost coming , so you turn other way ... but pac-man just continues run right into him . it really maddening , so much so after spending 10 minutes trying figure out what i doing wrong , i realized it just not made well . i think this cute " retro " gag gift , but not really made anyone who really wants play game or hopes get beyond level one , due poorly engineered controller	1
obviously this toy not recommended younger children(3 under ) but everyone else these things great ! i can't say enough geo mags ! i love them , my husband loves them all three kids love them too . they keep them busy hours inspire creativity . this set great too because you need large sets once kids get more creative their designs . my son 2 smaller kits they truly needed more . but these . you won't regret it . watch out magnets falling out plastic . if they discard them immediately . i've heard some scary stories regarding children swallowing powerful magnets . i like this brand ( geo mags ) better than magnetix because i think they better quality . hope this helpful	1

this awesome game requires basic settlers catan . game play last 3 4 hours . build cities , ward off barbarians , work other players but same time try win game . new cards rules make it great new game those who love settlers catan but getting tired it . great game not only high school college levels but older children adults well .	1
first time i played catan i taught cities knights . why throw someone pool before getting their feet wet regular catan ? because , my friend told me , once you play cities knights you understand why catan so addicting . it still . each week few friends come we watch movie play catan . none us really big " gamers " . none us own any miniatures , dice over six sides , or ever need create character . we just people grew up monopoly risk . said i now every version catan ever made we swap out things like volcano , great river , jungle other things last year we playing it , never gotten board game . it great its interaction others well worth frustration one might get when first learning it .	1
this expansion original settler catan adds whole new dimension game . after little time learning ( not much if you know original game ) you now playing game new depth . while it may harder than original younger kids , it so much more keep interest older kids adults ! each time you play you learn more game seems change " chance " elements game . our family highly recommends this !	1

i bought this bed my son who loves superheroes . i thought it would look great his newly redectorated room . it look great if you manage get it together . instructions came bed not clear or detailed . it uses hex screws assemble it , it include small wrench , but pain . me my huband working together assemble bed it took us 4 hrs it . we put togehter many beds , cribs , other things over years , this highly difficult . rails support mattress not manufactured properly . thankfully my father-in-law uses same type metal piping his factory . we replaced what came bed metal piping he made . piping bed came would not stay slots , piping cut half inch too short . so anytime bed moved , wiggled , or sat upon they would fall out . thus making mattress fall onto floor . my son so happy gotten bed , when we tell him he would wait day before he could use it he heart broken . all together once it assembled it look like photo . i would not purchased this item if i know it would require so much work us replace parts should worked first place . superman photos bed large stickers you stick headboard footboard when assembling product . bed also comes asortment screws bolts assemble bed . packaging they not clearly marked so you tell difference them . it difficult deciding which screws use , screw holes material not alienged properly . my husband re-bore most screw holes frame just so we could screw bold bed together . i not recommend purchasing this item unless you prepared work it . only good thing this item it ship quickly . i it less week order date .	1

my daughter loves all her weebles , she started her large collection this weebly wobbly tree house when she year old . she now two still plays it all time . first her favorite features slide secret hole tree house , when dropped down into , weebles pop through front door ! now she little older , she also enjoys whirly water wheel , spinning crow nest , removable swing . it no wonder why this award winning infant/ toddler toy year ! even my six year old enjoys it ! our only complaint tree house music very loud there no way control volume or turn toy off . also , it very sensitive slightest touch get it going . my husband i witnessed our cat walk past set it off ! it loud enough wake up our daughter ( very light sleeper ) , sleeping floor above , but since we aware how sensitive it , we keep this toy place where us walking won't activate loud music ! regardless how loud it , this wonderful toy must-have every playroom	1
great fun , interative but ... this toy would earn 5 stars if there either on/off switch volume , or some kind volume control . it way too loud ..	1
my 3 year old daughter recieved this christmas played it every day since . she loves slide features waterwheel especially , but seems play all accessories equally . it came lots extra weebles bikes ( it purchased sam club ) so she lots characters choose . music rather loud , but no more than town set . personally i think that one reasons she likes it so much . it great addition other weebles playsets i sure she'll gets lots enjoyment it	1
i like this toy although i feel it overpriced . it should stand $12.99 $14.99 most . i like it because it makes realistic sound . it no sharp or rough edges it nice size little boy . there aren't many western style weapons out there don't shoot caps make realistic firing noise . you always buy cap guns but caps give off smell loud bang not what i need right now . i prefer this rifle revolver combination their accurate yet not overpowering blast sound . set also bandana(small ) badge . both essential items recreate life old west	1
i absolutely love this game , yes it little different than original , but i like because same principal apply but it get little harder you get 30 seconds per round , you press button start , you get one word , if it gessed you press button once get point , if you think you enought time move next work you press button again , if word guessed before 30 seconds up you press button once get next point , other wise if it not guessed you loose entire points round . this makes it lot more interesting . only thing after while some same words start repeating , i would like see larger memory game . but it great	1
i no idea there whole kit ! i came here review crayola bath tub tints . all this other stuff ... who knew ? but i'll checking it out . i am life-long fan practitioner taking baths . my son follows my footsteps may well exceed my passion devotee good long , hot soak . we like look like cooked lobsters when we're . mere hot tubs tremble our presence . this crayola stuff so cool . i give it my full-fledged endorsement . there nothing quite like bathing nearly boiling purple water . ( or green , or orange , or blue , or red ... though i can't go yellow my son ... just looks too suspicious )	1
this excellent toy little ones - soft edges , no scary teeth or angry eyes . fisher price wonderful job this whole set : brontosaurus 7 baby , t-rex baby , triceratops baby -- however -- whoever priced this $29.99 must made mistake . fp own website sells it only $10 . it must buy toddlers	1

thomas train sets great modern versions classic indestructible wooden train sets . simple enough avoid toddler age frustrations getting cars run track yet complex enough engage wide range ages ( up including grandpas ) . all stories help imagination part .... books videos provide endless source adventures acted out , although most kids perfectly capable inventing their own episodes . here my advice , if you trying work your way through maze start-up options : first all , you spend fortune huge set .... even if you afford it , i would start something small give child joy receiving chain small but intriguing presents over long period time . it fosters joy giving/receiving helps teach them come back again again same toy ... watching it grow , asking specific items stories they hear , etc . several reviewers suggest painting old coffee table this great idea . i suggest figure 8 set ( most popular one ) or if you want spend little bit more , conductors figure 8 set . both complex enough interesting , but simple enough give lots room growth . almost immediately i would add new present one inexpensive engines ( you ask child which story they like best get engine them .... or buy engine go video or book same gift ) .... these would percy small engine , bill yellow engine , treavor , ( or bit more $ :) lady engine , james red engine , gordon express engine ( he one best stories , i think ) , or henry green engine . now good stuff ! give it month or so , then reward child something really cool like barrel loader or rusty construction 3 car set . i honestly can't see point huge multi hundred dollar system sets . if you want impress neighbors or something , go it , but i'm telling you ..... most kids enjoy large number small thoughtful gifts , not " keep-up-with-the-jones " effort your part . good behavior rewarded pick-your-own trip store ( there sometimes when real time shopping trip can't beat)by way , thomas stories based real restored engines run england mid-hants railway watercress line near winchester ( you read them even plan trip ride real thomas trains checking out watercressline.co.uk ) . they day trip london rail stations , although i recommend using bb winchester area staying overnight if you decide go . winchester center old saxon kingdom wessex king alfred well major early medieval site ( cathedral tombs many saxon kings well jayne austen izaac walton it where richard lionhearted crowned . )	1
when i saw this toy advertised tv then looked it up internet i very impressed rushed out buy it ... but i very disappointed . i admit i like all classic stories i remember when i kid it easy use but there way too little game . it four play options , first it just read story , which i am stay home mom so i don't need dvd read my daughter i myself . second option child read story themselves , which again if your child knows how read they it book don't need dvd . third option read play , this function i really interested . but it turns out there only 4 questions per dvd . i amazed !! how much your child really going learn just 4 questions . last option story games ... these vary per dvd depending what story there once again only 2 games . they could version classic game memory , putting story order , identifying letters , etc . those aren't too bad but i found some games , like memory game , you time pushing buttons just right time dvd loads your answers or you get it wrong even if you pushed right order buttons . i even problem getting timing right when i showing my daughter how it worked . overall i very very upset over how little there dvds ... 4 questions 2 games , my daughter got bored each disk within 20 minutes . if i could i would return game get my money back !	-1
my son 31/2 i got him this toy two week ago he play it everday he learning how read this toy so coolll !!!! my sister son birthday coming up i'm going get him one next week thank alot fisher pric	1
we bought this our 6 year old daughter christmas . it hit ! she really enjoys it . headset however doesn't get used . microphone feature headset works suprisingly well but it so heavy she finds it uncomfortable when trying dance . skill level wise - i think it perfect any child under 8 or 10 if they haven't years dance . our daughter taken some dance few years but she not very coordinated . this greatly increased her coordination ability learn dance steps . first it too difficult but she enjoyed watching it now she able follow much better . girls video also appropriately dressed seem like good role models . best benefit - 45 minutes workout while wacthing tv ! i'd recommend .	1
my 7 year old daughter can't get enough it . it teaches basic dance moves using mat numbers it then they put it music . matter hours , my daugther dancing away . she loves it . i highly recommend it	1
i purchased this clearance very good price say i am very pleased this item . it completely interactive lots fun my 3 year old son . we continue purchase many matchbox adventure sets this simply edition our growing collection . while i must admit his attention not stay this item long , he return it end . you enter wash turn lever move top elevator , here conveyor take car through rollers while it blows bubbles out well , then it down spiral track into wash tank spins , finally your out dryer spins also , hit release button off you go . pretty entertaining much evolved over anything i child	1
while doomsday figure looks pretty cool , it would nice bizarro , i really hate it they're dumping more batman , superman , wonder woman figures us . i already plenty those , thank you very much . notice box says doomsday figure exclusive this package , so if i want it i no choice but spend extra money figures i already . transparent amazo ? what kind sense make	1
my daughter received this game christmas although concept very cute game easy enough play , it very frustrating . gowns made rubber tear very easily . it also very difficult child dress undress princesses . other accessories also made rubber don't stay place , so you're constantly replacing them when they fall off . we now play game princesses already dressed play accessories only . this works out better princesses remain standing when fully dressed opposed using plastic stand , which tends fall off when princesses moved . nonetheless my daughter loves this game it one her favorites play , but personally i don't think it worth money .	1
i purchased this car christmas gift i very happy nephew because it . car works great i remember these types cars child . it works better than i remember any cars i played ever . great price too . great buy amazon	1
we two these sets go our larger geotrax collection , made elements up 4 units high . first i assumed they'd most fun elevated structures like clock or mountain , but actually these lot fun all themselves . other than ramps , green elevated track used either elevated or place regular track flat ground . these kits thoughtfully include some half-length straight pieces which give you many more options - example , now you use both arms 90-degree cross pieces come some other sets . i'm impressed design - even when we make 4-ramp roller-coastereque descent , train still stays track if you use guardrails curves .	1
new track really cool put together though little tougher then other track younger children . my 4 1/2 year old loves it but my 3 year old just can't put them together nor him understand concept . my husband i alot fun building large 3d tracks all over our living room . great toy but elevation series not 2 1/2 year olds maybe 3 1/2	1
this probably best magnetic construction set market . geomag much stronger magnets all other set . supermag also just strong but much more difficult play because varying lengths its pieces . geomags , you attach bars fashion which can't supermags . this set particularly nice because it also glows dark , you actually see metal bar magnets thru translucent plastic ! very cool . newer sets come booklet great magnetic science projects . this set not come booklet , but it viewed www.geomagsa.com website . this website also lots other great geomag products work well this set	1

this essentially one player version 2 platyer set . this pointless waste time . allow me explain , simplest terms , you cannot anything 1 lazer tag gun except listen sound effects . although , you say " what if i only need 1 gun " then i'd tell you price point this offered , you should just spent extra 20 get 2 . great game great system , but one pointless . read review 2 player system orthe irt-x2 review further product description .	1

this toy isn't what i wanted because it doesn't work tent it leaves small room playing . i don't really reccommend it	1
i love this product . i recommend advanced math kit , without packaging , since it seems best price per part any zome kit ( 1308 pieces i've seen it somewhere online $79 plus shipping if you buy it without case ) . you make really neat geometric objects ( find some these google ) , although my 3-year old too young zome he benefits too because i made him very nice bridge over which his toy train runs . it'll great when he bit older him play this pick up some math fun way	1

this trike just doesn't work . i wish i read reviews before i bought it . steering not work well . then if you try take adult handle off so your child peddle his own , doesn't work either . peddles don't catch . they just slip round round without turning wheels . big waste money . think twice before you purchase this .	-1

we hoped this would fun , stimulating toy our then 10 month old . christmas morning came , we tried it , touch-screen buttons didn't work . received new one buttons worked but only if you pressed very hard one particular spot . also , there not lot going , gets boring redundant very fast	1
i very disappointed this product . amount we paid xpv battery pack ( $100.00 ) it should last much longer . my son got it christmas played it couple times it pretty cool . but it so fragile , it already won't fly anymore . if i paid $30.00 it i wouldn't nearly upset it . i wouldn't suggest buying this product until either price comes down , or quality goes up	1
i bought cutter ebay scrapbooking . based upon crayola advertising how it " cuts where sissors can't reach " ( which bull ) - thought it would good cutting shapes alphabets -- felt $[ ... ] better than spending anywhere $[ ... ] $[ ... ] die cut machines dies . boy i wrong !! you hold button down continuously keep it powered --- which makes your hand ache after minute ( this thing give anyone carpal tunnel syndrome !! ) ( i am sure they designed safety feature kids perhaps , but i can't see how if it hard healthy adult use -- how little child hand endure this ! ) additionally , no matter what angle you hold it - it very hard get teeny blade perforate or cut anything properly . even when moved super-snail pace , no cuts clean . they look if you tore them out paper . i tried over over , using directions then trying many different angles , speeds , varying pressure , no avail . this thing piece junk !! total waste my money time . it sits my drawer gathering dust . i am tempted send it directly crayola headquarters i would like see them make 3-d picture intricately cut flower bird using this piece junk . yeah right . don't waste your money	-1
don't waste your money ! i not buy this amazon it unavailable , but don't bother find it elsewhere . you push so hard cutter get it cut it tears paper . my 11 year old unable use it effectively . i barely able get it cut clean line . can't imagine frustration people paid $30 plus ebay get one these christmas . i'm returning mine use credit some good safety scissors , constuction paper glue	-1
just got this our 11 year-old since she loves artistic this wonderful buy . it easy use comes 3 different stencils . ( 1 shapes , other 2 letters ) but , you purchase regular stencils ( plastic kind ) any local store use those . you also draw freehand what you want cut out hold it just your would pencil trace over it cut it out . you make so many neat projects this such 3-d cards ! or just cut out shapes then glue different color paper underneath . if you little artist your family , get it . it great adults well , especially if you like scrapbooking . it good bargain	1
service i got amazon amazing whatever i ordered came within days no waiting . products just nice if i bought them store shipping handling great also .. thanks letting me home shopper ...... barbara penna	1
please don't waste your time money this piece junk . it falls apart constantly not stand still while playing . plus platform top not hold many batman figures . i purchased 4 action figures none them fit top , so platform completely useless . my son who 4 gets frustrated because accessories come apart city falls back . it not sturdy . very disppointing toy ! not worth time money !!	-1
toy itself car great . my 5 year old runs it around all time ramming it things it very durable . however , when you try turn it into gotham city it becomes bit challenge everyone . first there no lever we could find lets middle pop down , so you literally fight it get latch let go . this fight adulta well children . second there these chains you latch floors city hooks attach chains too so small you really work it get them go . my 5 year old gets very frustrated when he tries turn it into city most time just plays car part . it bit disappointing him because thie toy he really wanted christmas it turned out not what he thought .	1
very cute dolls . kind small but rather durable . they sit or stand . arms legs bend . my daughter playing them nearly all time	1

i purchased this set figure 8 expansion set my son christmas 2005 . he just over 2 years old , he loves thomas tank engine particular , all things train related general , so this very easy decision make . quality learning curve wooden track very good ; pieces made hardwood , quite sturdy . while we expanded using other generic tracks which compatible brio/thomas track , there noticeable difference quality . i would offer one caveat . this set very similar conductor figure 8 set , which typically offered same price . while water tower comes this set pretty neat accessory , i think conductor set offers bit better value , it comes thomas two cars ( water tower set only comes one engine one car ) , well additional switch track conversion ramp . these offer bit more flexibility layout play , especially since my son not terribly interested water tower right now ( though this may change when he gets older )	1
we gave this our 4 yr old son his birthday . when he opened it - he yelled out " cool ! " . i don't think there could any higher praise 4 yr old . he wanted water tower , but since it retailed $25 alone - i felt it definitely worth it spend $15 more get whole set ! thomas products learning curve excellent quality provide years enjoyment your little engineer	1

when we puchased this here amazon , i read reviews raved how easy it put together within 2 hours . we consider ourselves intelligent people , but we found it quite different story . directions pictures , written explanation might more helpful . pictures not show correct direction pieces some cases , so when we got few steps ahead , we realized we piece backwards take it apart backtrack few times . finally we started checking few steps ahead make sure it work later if we this now ..... so , it took my husband i 4 or 5 hours i guess complete , we finished it flashlight just after sunset christmas eve ! but , we like outcome	1
i purchased this item my son his 1st birthday . my husband friend put it together 2 hours didn't seem any difficulty it . we purchased two infant swings replaced big kid ones came this item most our friends infants or toddlers so it seemed make sense 2 infant swings available . my son not much climber 12 months old but love swings . he appeared afraid slide down slides well . he now 16 months old expert climber lol . he loves climb his gym set slides down his slides over over over again . he plays this set often climb slide independently now course mommy close . this item very sturdy appears perfect fit him his age . we looked into more expensive wooden sets but they all seemed bit too big him such young age . i see him getting plenty use out this item until he 6 years old which time we plan upgrading larger wooden set . it seemed make sense buy this beginner set because anything larger would difficult him get much use out until he bit older . most larger items i recommend you purchase it your local toys us or target because shipping this item very expensive . buy this item store , save money shipping use it buy your infant attachment swings instead : 0 )	1

my 2 year old daughter got this present within month it broken . while it worked , she loved it very good it . it often frustrating though when she would push handle down over over get no bubbles . eventually , thing stopped working altogether . i figured batteries died when i went change them , i found bubble solution leaked into battery compartment . i initially chalked it up my daughter maybe i didn't see her something it so we bought her one . this one broken within few days due same problems . concept this great , but not worth money all	1
my daughter received this gift her 1st birthday . she likes it so much i came on-line purchase one friend decided look other reviews . i'm surprised negative comments ! after watching me demonstrate how use bubble blower my daughter able use it ease . once it primed ( few pulls handle trick ) bubble blower produces 10-20 bubbles each time handle pulled . course she doesn't always pull handle down far enough nor she always release it enough dip stick bubble solution but that all part learning . product leak bubbles if it tipped upside down but package tells you . maybe i'm just not critical enough but less than $15 my kid play something she loves - bubbles . there absolutely no way she could work bottle wand bubbles . instead bubble blower - give your 1 year old bottle bubbles you'll much bigger mess she probably won't able blow single bubble .	1

yes , controller mini wpt final table-how cute ... i've playing over year now(i paid $30 canadian still think it worth every penny-even though blue button now starting make clicking noises , it still works fine ) still play it once month even though i 5 ps2 poker games i enjoy more . characters this game don't speak but least it spares you hearing repeated phrases occur all other poker games currently market(though you could always just turn voices off , if you wanted ) . also , if you make final table(of 6)in tournament you'll get hear mono version wpt theme before round starts , which nice touch . a.i. later rounds blinds increase gets very aggressive . i would say it most agressive cpu a.i. i've come across so far(excluding pc games ) . ps2 wpt videogame checks way too much but still more fun play overall(tons variety)and it cards big , colorful easy read . ps2 videogames , world championship poker 2 , stacked world series poker come close times aggressive betting style(constant raising)that this wpt plug play game incorporates but still not consistantly wild . this plug play wpt poker game , even though i've unlocked ability access any 9 different tournaments 9 different satellites well cash games(the tournaments 50 over 300 people each)instantly because i got enough points become wpt player year over 14 million dollars ; it mostly cheating(the game auto save after you win or lose , but if you lose , you just shut off unit before it auto saves you won't lose your buy-in amount . you start beginning tournament again but this way you reckless your all-in still enough money enter again)because cpu players maniacs killer tough . cpu bluff all-in garbage one hand then all-in pocket aces very next hand . you just never know what cpu . even so , it play logically most time even slowplay top pair . cpu only make occasional questionable play but that allright since they all play different skill levels i assume(you only adjust cpu players individual skill levels multi-player mode ) . it , however , bit too easy times make small bet flop early position all 5 cpu players fold ; even big stacks(though , even ps2 game stacked , i sometimes get huge stack fold against my tiny all-in bet ) . this wpt plug play game you also go all-in frequently get them fold , but if they hand-look out ! so going all-in or limping garbage , very risky later rounds especially when you're playing against some top 10 players whose names faces always stay same so you recognize them(as opposed other characters who look same but different names ) . after all-in showdown cards turned over slow enough rate some suspense but i'd prefer able press button turn over cards after i figured out what percentages my outs(as no % shown like tv or ps2 version ) . you set cpu betting speed slow fast also just press blue button make them bet right away . rules-wise , one thing this game differently than ps2 wpt game turn river minimum bet supposed double big blind , but not this game . however , most casino tournaments don't double these bets no-limit games anyway . one minor thing i like , if pot currently let say $500 you then bet $200(making pot now $700)causing other cpu players fold , it show you won $500(because $200 your last bet never called , thus not officially part pot)whereas all other poker games say you just won $700 pot , which misleading my opinion . also , game only flash freeze if your four alkaline aa batteries get weak after 20 hours use . if you use regular aa batteries game freeze less than hour . that why reviewer probably trouble freezing . game save your career stats(such % flops seen while small blind , etc . ) also let you see your current game stats any time just pressing red pause button front side table . graphics passable color . well , cards big enough easy read . though none players bets shown beside their names(they only appear briefly betting window bottom ) , so if you cpu betting set brief delay(like i do)you'll only know how much you need call not example which players raised or re-raised or how much(if there more than 1 cpu player still hand ) . one more annoying things this game you only 30 seconds make your bet(it countdown circle meter-you hear clock ticking during last 15 seconds warn you)or else you forced either fold or check(if checking possibility ) . other dumb thing you can't save middle tournament ! yes , it makes it tougher cheat but it still annoying sit through 2 hours straight playing close match only realize it time work . that why i prefer my ps2 poker games(only world championship poker 2 hard rock casino don't let you save middle tournament . ) so , all means , if you're poker fan want test your skill luck against some wildest players ever(thus 4 star rating ) , buy this game after months practise you too should able win some this game tournaments without cheating(or least come close )	1
this very fun game definitely gives you " just one more game " thrill you're looking . you adjust speed so once you get hang it you don't wait nearly long game bells whistles . my problem during tournaments . game keeps running total how many players left . but it seems people dropping out like they giving away mansions down road . you start 100 players it down 85 just ten hands . becomes issue because money those players lose go somewhere , when new players fill empty seats your table they often ludircrous amounts money hand . few exits your table you go chip leader shortstack without calling hand	1

i bought this toy my daughter christmas , loved other parents brand toys we've bought her . my daughter initial reaction fear . it extremely loud , needlessly so . i suppose level noise supposed imitate real car , but it really just annoying if you're parent , little scary if you're one-year old . once she became acclamated level noise it made , it hold her interest . very least she found remote good chew toy , pleasantly surprised button it fact move car . assuming she close enough car . someone said range 15 feet . maybe they modified our model car even crappier . once car got 4-5 feet away , it hesitant respond acted bit squirrely even when it respond . 15 feet ( less , really ) remote became totally useless . i figured time my daughter would get hang all these nuiances it would probably provide few minutes entertainment here there . time not our side . toy broke less than two weeks after christmas . remote no longer works all - batteries fine . car turn , noisily sit there its flashing lights , but that it . needless say , small token fun value this toy gone . don't waste your money this toy - it guaranteed disappointment	-1

this shape sorted purchased my oldest child first birthday . he also special needs pt ot time . 4 years later after 3 kids , this toy still much loved looks like new . we also had/used many shape sorters this one far best . it appealing younger older children , younger ones may need more help getting 6 differnt shapes right holes , older ones like flip it back forth getting all shape then opening it starting over . far quality , this sorter made hard plastic . so even during those early teething years , this toy show no teeth marks . hard plastic allows it easily go dishwasher cleaning	1
my three year old loves this toy . she now control over her own music player , there no cd scratch . i highly recommend speakers -- we never use headphones	1
if you more than one child , or your child plays other kids , this must-have addition your fisher price fp3 player . my son finds it easy use , this way there no bickering over who gets hear headphones . they don't get too loud , but they loud enough provide music kid bedroom	1
we bought this truck our 2 year old he fascinated " trash trucks " , he loves it ! even months later he still loves playing it . my only possible complaint would it somewhat hard carry places back truck different opening points which makes truck flop open while trying pick up or carry , especially little one . this not big enough problem , however , me not recommend it . it sturdy there other pieces little tikes line vehicles coordinate well it	1

this such great idea kids ! tooth brush plays music when you start brushing your teeth . harder your kids brush their teeth , louder music gets ! kids love it because they like show guests how their tooth brush sing . you room while your kids brushing you know they're doing good job if you hear music . if not , you tell ' em " i can't hear you brushing ! " awesome , just awesome	1
my seven year old son thought this fish tank coolest thing he ever seen . it really , awesome coral formations various undersea creatures , course floating sharks . it lights up , which makes it even cooler . but , when we put water it , it leaked all over counter . so , heavy heart , i packed it up sent it back . i didn't dare order replacement tank , thinking it might same thing . instead , we went pet store , spent many more dollars 10 gallon tank , light , filter , heater , coral reef decorations , scuba diver , plastic plants , gravel . . . . oh , course , fish , still work progress	1
i got this my son last year when he 4 he really likes it . good boys who want adventurous but parents who little cautious ! it very sturdy durable he likes fact he use it scooter or skateboard . only con i see tires little bit wide back when he puts his foot down push it , his ankle gets hit wheel . he careful makes sure his foot placed wide enough out . other than , great toy	1
i bought this product my daughter xmas two years ago . it hasn't got much use because it difficult steer narrow sidewalk . even so , wheels become very loose their plastic trucks , i can't find way adjust them ! if you're looking scooter , skip this buy type scooter . if you're looking something train young child ride skateboard , this may you . i'd recommend this off-road model opposed one regluar skateboard wheels - off-road wheels take more abuse they handle riding grass bumps . because its limited speed steering , i wouldn't recommend this child older than 4 . older kids struggle keep up their friends riding regular scooters if they're riding switchboard	1
we gave this our 2 year old we putting up our christmas decorations . she loves decoration her own play , since she can't touch many other decorations . it enough pieces keep her interest , but not so many they all over house . also it cute enough leave out decoration	1

i didn't realize there different kinds thomas track . thomas track our train sets so far flips -- one side train , other side road . why i didn't read all details this road track ordered 2 sets ! trains don't stay it since it too wide they curves . quality track nice , what i expect thomas ( no rough edges , splinters , irregular edges like brio ) . but i don't want/need road track , i want train track	1

well we purchased this toy - slinky dog , because our son loves toy story this looked like best slinky we could find . we recieved it quickly my son blast it . even hugs it even though its not soft .. ha ha ! legs not move which i not expect them too , but those wondering this toy it wheels its feet string out its head thats 4-6inches long . there string upper torso backend through tail inside slinky parts so toy not over extend . ( helps keep slinky part not stretched out ) - those never slinky toy if they stretch too fast become misshaped hard reshape if all . also like add my son get it little slinky bent next body but its toy kids things like it really didnt ruin look or funtion toy all . its easy clean . ;) short : toy great rolls wheels	1
dog not slinky dog toy story but fact , authentic " slinky dog "	1

i given original jetfire present around 1985 , i remember very confused when watching transformers television show because jetfire called " skyfire " although coloring same , overall design definitely different . he same guy ? if not , where skyfire toy , why didn't jetfire appear tv show ? i not discover until 15 years later this something licensing . original jetfire toy not based transformers toy line all , but some bizarre cross-marketing scheme somehow ended veritech fighter macross/robotech getting autobot symbol slapped onto it . evidently hasbro/takara able procure rights produce toy , but not include its image tv show . cool thing this " classic " transformer its design no longer resembles original jetfire/veritech design , but skyfire design appeared transformers tv show . they would better off calling this skyfire , but probably banking popularity original toy help sell more units than memories tv show ... or there some other bizarre licensing thing behind scenes . definitely good piece tf history own any collector	1
easy plug into tv easy play . draw paint . there even pictures you color . shake cartridge start over . my almost three year old no trouble using cartridge .	1
i love building bricks . i love batman . i hate this set . this most disappointing " kit " i've ever misfortune purchase . i complained directly manufacturer their ill-fitting bricks , but naturally never heard back . most bricks fit together loosely causing them pop off most inopportune times . flat base pieces made poor plastic too thin , so unless you very flat very hard surface ( sometimes even then ) , bricks pop off . floor " upper level " completely warped because bricks so poorly shaped fit together so badly . thank goodness lego got batman license built decent kit . it too bad this set , building plan nice design nice . but it wasn't worth frustration nor price . not even mini-figs worth it . what up freaking lavender bricks anyway ? i don't recall batcave colour . ugh ugh ugh	-1
i got this last summer my two young boys they absolutely loved it ! there small but steady stream water comes each side every 3 seconds or so center erupts . likes - kids play this forever ! it easy screw off hose . dislikes - there not steady stream water going up ( since it bladder fill explode ) . you cannot adjust water pressure too low or it won't erupt , so it not good small lawn area . it not convenient shape store . because side streams , lawn doesn't get watered evenly kids play it . it very good value . there bladder fills water erupt inside eventually popped after year half use .	1

this game developing steady hands children well teaching them balance . dozens plastic penguins equally divided players . players then take turns placing penguins onto tiered board balances center like loose lampshade . if any penguins fall off during player turn , they become part player flock . knocking all penguins off not automatically lose game . first person get rid all their penguins wins . because fallen penguins re-enter play instead knocking out player , this game run ten or fifteen minutes . there some setup necessary penguins arrive three pieces need assembled . this pretty easy but some penguins seem go together better than others . because penguins distributed evenly players extras left out , loss penguin or two not keep game working . my kids lot fun playing this one , especially my daughter who currently very into penguins . check it out	1

this toy works very well ! i very surprised magnetic pull darts strong it . granted , one magnets fell out dart after only 2 days , but not big deal .. bit glue job . i like this one much better than velcro ones ... every bit fuzz , pet hair ... whatever gets stuck those after seconds it out box . overall , i consider this good purchase . my son loves he play darts while we play our board	1
we got one these gift , it total failure . " vehicle sound block " toy supposed make sounds vehicles when blocks lined up correctly . we got batteries , but toy simply didn't work . no sound , no nothin . ' we also given one their farm sound puzzle toys couldn't get back panel batteries open . tried using small philips screwdriver , safety pin , etc ., it simply would not open . lack sound disappointing , though our child still liked pretty puzzle . this company seems well plain wood toys , but when they branch out into electronics , products fairly shoddy . i plan avoid their products future	-1
material printed , it not real costume . my 3 yrs son loves it , but i think you get something better amount money .	-1
leap pad systems wonderful learning tools . price family meal fast food resturant you provide your child interactive tool learning . not only book help your child read but they play games too	1
i bought this toy my 2 year old . yes , he loves it but i think it would better 3 or 4 or even 5 year old . it gets quite messy but it easy clean up . there large piece plastic comes box handy put beneath sand box it makes cleanup lot easier . there also many little pieces not good small children . i 10 month old who puts everything his mouth i watch he doesn't grab these little pieces . but overall , whole point toy my child loves it spends long amounts time playing it . he very enthusiastic construction equipment he loves play dirt so this toy he best both worlds !	1
we just bought this doll my daughter third birthday . she loves it ! less than $$ you can't pass this doll up . belle beautiful long hair your little girl comb(great fine motor skills practice ) . all her clothes removable easy washing well additional skills practice your child . she comes tea set cookies two . my daughter loves play tea her . belle only sings short song when her hand pressed . it very sweet , short doesn't easily go itself like other toys . if your little girl loves disney princesses this great affordable addition her collection . overall , this toy wonderful buy .	1
these toys great both gender children age 3 up	1
this one those really neat things every kid should try least once . city mini world great back drop watch these amazing little creatures grow . we still it fact now new generation living among our growing metropolis . we might purchase little more advanced set because when " monkeys " get big they sometimes get stuck when you trying oxygenate water . this no big deal because i can't imagine very many kids wanting keep them this long . my husband i love " sea monkeys " want see them thrive !	1
i bought this my grand daughter who turning 3 . she loves it . especially because she close it up carry it her where ever she goes	1
i got this armoire dora dress up adventure doll two outfits my daughter second birthday . she absolutely adores dora this her first doll she change clothes . she really loves changing clothes doll putting clothes inside armoire . armoire comes gown several hangers hanging up dora clothes . inside doors , there hook one door mirror other . hook nice hanging up dora accessories . there also handle top carrying . doors easy her open , yet they latch so if she carries armoire handle , doors won't open spill out clothes . there also room bottom armoire storing addtional accessories like shoes . only drawback armoire most it hold four outfits available dora dress up adventure doll because there lots accessories these outfits . thing clothes don't stay hangers very well . i found some stay better than others . overall , this good storage place outfits dora dress up adventure doll	1
i bought this my daughter 3rd birthday . i assembled it 20 minutes . box came mangled though it several scratches all white instead pink like picture . also some pieces didn't fit together all way , though it still seems sturdy enough . my daughter played it every day since her birthday . i love all melissa doug products	1
this toy keep my children engaged more than 30 minutes . thomas his friends wooden collection far best all thomas toys . it durable very effective . take toys nice , too , but magnets not allow you connect more than 2-3 cars time . magnet just too weak . track accessories take kind cheap . battery operated plastic ones nice , but track comes them simply horrible , especially automobile track . wooden ones gives you durabilty , playability connectivity . track very durable , connects very well ( even thought thomas brand very expensive ) , connectivity magnets far superior than take line ( my son connected 10+ trains without single one coming off . collectibility these things really gone up popularity , well . discontinued items sold auction $40-$50 times , one single train . only gripe i cost . one wooden train usually $10 . you get them free dvd much ( maybe couple dollars more ($12-$15 ) . larger trains , such gordan , henry , et al , even more . thomas track very expensive , generally hard spend much money . you get imaginarium brand ( which makes thomas stuff ) , considerably , but not thomas name . there other knockoff brands ( ikea one ) , but those not usually compatible thomas stuff . my children like thomas due personalities all engines , how they brought life dvds . wooden thomas just adds hands fun kids , if you don't mind spending little extra , you get great product .	1
my son target all his milestones until i bought this toy whole collection . he became obsessed it he would not want play anything else asked me buy more more thomas toys . i made tests him he showed developmental delays . two child psychologists two occupational therapists told me it statistically common children become too obsessed this particular toy they show developmental delays . therefore , i got rid all thomas collection my child now again track his age . but it took me some time correct his behavior therapies . i would not recommend this toy any child . if your child gets too obsessed it , discard it yourself favor , not buy collection	-1
i'm 11 years old i'm still huge fan thomas . i know every characters name number . only part i don't like little toy people company uses . characters telivision series so far : thomas , edward , henry , gorden , james , percy , toby , duck , donald , douglas , oliver , harvey , emily , murdoch , aurther , fergus , mighty , mac , molly , neville , lady , bill , ben , skarlory , rhenahas , peter sam , sir handel , duke , duncan , smudger , bertrum , rusty , salty , boco , daisy , mavis , diesel 10 , bowler , diesel , dennis , spattler , dodge , iron arry , iron derek , bert , spencer , stepney , jack , alfie , byron , kelly , ned , oliver(2 ) , isabella , max , eliethabeth , bertie , bulgy , terence , trever , cranky , bulstroude , lorry 1 , lorry 2 , lorry 3 , butch , thumper , boulder , canal boat , t.j. tyson lorries , frieght trucks , cargo cars , coaches , old slow coach , annie , clarribel , fire trucks , . . ruffy , toad , n.w. breakvan , city turou engine , flying kipper , sir topham hatt , lady hatt , harold , tigermoth , buster , nelson , monty , patrick , proteus , rosie , freddie , rocky , jeremy , sodor airplanes some minor people . we all know there more characters some day . i know who ever reading this like come how many characters there . who every believe me books rev . . awrdy wrote 10 times characters . i also every episode thomas that available time . well other words i think you should buy all thomas products . this site best prices . remeber me s.l.j.c.o.a.a.a.t.r	1
i purchased this set my 3 year old niece birthday . i knew eventually her younger brother could use it well once he little older . i works very well both sex children relatively easy put together . you may need more than one person hold pieces while you screw things together but once place it very sturdy set . my niece thrown just everything three year old this set it still looks brand new . we'll see after her brother it year or so , if it still looks good . now though , i'm very satisfied quality	1
this pretty cool set . so if you want just get it collectibility then go it . if you want get it kids play ? well depends ages , but it pretty cool collectible	1
springs this toy extremely tight , making it very difficult babies toddlers operate . althouhg it nice see dinosaurs instead all other familiar characters , all other pop-up boxes i've seen quot ; rewardquot ; child popping up much less hand strength required	1
my daughter given this toy when she one , she played it over year . firstly fun seeing dinosaurs pop up , then she grew little older she'd memorize which color dino under which color egg , see if she could get it right . i think this one best presents she got her first bd . definitely recommend it	1
my 4.5 year old son got this santa . he loves it . if it superheroes he love it ! quality toy pretty good compared other toys out there . only major complaint we cityscape keeps falling out starting get frayed put it back into slots all time . it would nice if either matchbox made cityscape fixed or out material or both . overall i still would buy this toy again	1
my son loves thomas i thought this would perfect game , but it not . trains not turn easy , he not it i ( mom ) difficult time getting trains go way they suppose go . i disappointed this game	-1
my 4-year-old son loves thomas enjoys this game alot . i agree turning corners tricky bit frustrating but my son not mind all but he tends longer attention span than even myself .	1
i bought 3 these various family members friends . all girls ( ages 5 , 11 , 12 ) loved doll ! i happy see ! parents already made children put dolls away , not taken out boxes ! it nice know dolls taken great care ! besides , kwanzaa barbie doll beautiful deserves placed pedestal , so speak	1
i gave this game my sister her husband christmas they loved it . it fairly easy learn games not require long time commitment , unlike many strategy games . i enjoyed this game so much , i bought 3 more - one my grandparents , one my mentor student one myself . it reminds me uno different " house " rules added make strategy more complex . i'm still looking efficient way " shuffle " tiles . it inexpensive game 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 players i play several times night .	1
there two ways play this game . you play it basic rules . this game last 15-20 minutes minimal strategy . second way play this game advanced rules . this game last 30-40 minutes much more strategy . best part this game it alows quick rule explanation understanding . worst part this game even advanced rules , there still huge amount luck involved . whatever case . this great game if you looking quick light strategy game	1
i start off honest . we don't lego james * yet * . he still waiting join lego percy tracks , but i wanted tell you how much fun lego percy , i am sure lego james just great . first , thomas lego trains cute . they very good size small hands , although they don't come very much track , it doesn't seem matter all . my son ( 3.5 yo ) spends all his time playing his lego percy floor , combining his new friend some huge coach constructions he made . ( really some them huge -- lol)he this virtue fact duplo size lego wheeled vehicles pulled lego james lego percy . so not only he get play his favorite steamies , but he also gets make things ( sheds , even cranky ! ) his duplo legos . [ mega-bloks work too)five stars . cute educational toys allow lots imaginative play . my one suggestion would buy other legos - particularly some wheels bases coaches- if you don't already own some . this way lego james his educational best . your child build all sorts friends equipment . note : our lego collection 3099 . i couldn't find it amazon but i think lego duplo 140-pc . bulk tub ( 5352 ) ($15 ) wheeled base vehicles connect thomas friends lego trains	1
i wrote this review anakin starfighter , but this same toy other than paint scheme , so . . . this great toy . it very sturdy weighty . there no cheapness or junk construction . i would gues it last long time , even when played our 5-year-old boy . even smaller , more vulnerable parts such cockpit canopy landing gear seem tough fit together well . plastic type not break ( least not easily ) . i accidentally stepped it dark night ( i weight 230 pounds - pure muscle , course ) it not even crack or warp . he loves playing it too . we run around house mock dogfights . ( hint : if you make your starfighter hover behind door wait your enemy wander past , you fire your missiles quickly behind before enemy chance tell mom it not fair . ) overall , best toy we purchased long time - all sorts reasons . i even let my son play it now then . :	1
this toy best-looking jedi starfighters . i think it better-looking than even bright green toys us exclusive anakin/darth vader ship . unfortunately , you wait until august buy obi wan pilot . until then , you might better off using obi wan figures aotc phantom menace " pilot " ship , because rots obi wan figures not fit into cockpit very well . especially " jedi kick " obi wan figure . anyone else disappointed few more cheesy figures released this film ? i really disappointed figures lightsabers molded into their hands actions don't work ( jedi kick obi wan comes mind ) . please , just give me basic obi wan figure , maybe cloth jedi cloak ! someone who owned several vehicles original trilogy when i kid , i vouch durability new vehicles . old toys , nothing worked . tie fighters solar panels wouldn't stay , millenium falcon , cannon satellite dish wouldn't stay . course figures not fit well original vehicles . hasbro seems worked out most these problems ( except maybe figures fitting ) . obi wan starfighter great buy twenty bucks , it looks great out box display . one other thing : instructions say you fit " most " r2 droid figures place r4 drone comes ship . i tried rots artoo figure , it would not fit all . maybe r4 g9 " preview " droid fits , but i don't own figure yet	1
i agree other reviews this product . it carry more keeps everything together one " package " . my son carrying case he likes backpack better	1

this best lego set ever made . lot stuff godd price	1
near-perfect translation nhl ' 95 , not-so great port madden ' 95 . i'd originally heard fifa ' 95 ( soccer ) supposed here too , but i guess it never made it final product ... i got this last night - hockey some ommisions original ( like players names - here you only get jersey numbers ; i assume there problem licensing , possibly related current nhl lockout ?! ) , but otherwise still same great game , ton fun play . football , however , barely playable . you barely read plays , there hardly any sound ( no crowd noise , poor ' maddenisms ' ) , even music title screen isn't classic music - it just re-used hockey music . design / implementation-wise , i thought they could've made it so you could daisy-chain controllers together , but no - single player version this completely separate product - if you want play two player you buy two-controller version - you can't add later date . this unfortunate because these games ( original genesis versions ) supported 4 players , which course ups fun factor lot , but isn't possible they way jakks decided put it together . i continue love this product hockey game , but i won't even look football game again . if you're old-school fan nhl'95 , then this worth cash , but i just wish they could left out football enhanced hockey ( like putting players names - it hard remember who who back ' 95 ! ) .	1
i bought this over xmas break . we original rummikub my ( just turned ) 7 year old hard time playing it . she wants included rest us , but can't quite keep up . so i got this game see if it would easier her if we would all enjoy it . it so great ! she totally " gets " this version ! everyone fun now . thank goodness this game	1

my 10 year old daughter received this gift ; all games she got birthday/christmas , this top five . game requires some strategy -- random draw card , you must choose which horse compete event . each horse varying degrees strength four different categories , but only used once game . players progress through each event , they must use weaker horses -- this where strategy comes , players must think advance best way use their stable horses . " right " answer not necessarily use strongest horse each time . additional complexity , there also equipment cards boost strength horse single turn . adults won't find this game particularly hard , but interesting enough make it fun play your kids	1

you clearly see your hairline under cap , not mention little triangular tip very obvious top cap , making you look like human condom ( pardon expression ) . also , most caps come small " makeup " kit help blend cap your skin ( highly recommended ) . this one course not . i fortunately only needed this cap one little gig , it served its purpose . but if you planning making bald cap part elaborate costume , i'd advise you look elsewhere .	1

we bought this our son fourth birthday . toy listed 8+ year-olds , but our son knack remote control vehicles , seen fly wheels television , really wanted one ( he no trouble operating toy ) . toy takes four aa batteries one 9-volt battery . regarding controls , although they look simple -- simply back forth -- each wheel independently controlled since truck designed flip over when it runs into something it can't power over , flipping causes " reverse " become " forward " vice versa . not deal breaker , but still bit confusing , probably take most kids bit time get used especially since toy designed run circles if you only engage one wheel time , since toy flips over very easily , even if you just stop it quickly ( not just if you run it into something ) . novice , it hard get toy run smoothly back forth . maybe design advantage some , but we found it bit frustrating . deal breaker us toy not work you might expect , nor like line remote controlled fly wheels advertised television . television commercial , fly wheels shown easily going over rocks sticks " rough " backyard terrain . not so reality . we took power claw outside our flat lawn covered leaves , toy immediately got stuck leaves ( stuck wheels seized-up refused move , and/or stuck just spinning its wheels going nowhere -- either way you go over pick it up move it area ) . it got stuck pine needles . it got stuck long grass . it got stuck short grass . it got stuck dirt . it run well our flat , cement patio . regardless if " claws " or out , we could not get this toy run well any " terrain " except carpet , cement , ceramic tile ( note , if " claws " out , they would pull get stuck carpet pile ) . additionally , we laid out pillows , blankets , sleeping bags see if we could run toy over indoor " kid stuff " terrain , , again , no luck -- it either pushed stuff aside or flipped over went reverse , or simply got stuck , spinning its wheels -- we never actually got toy " power " over anything , rather it would flip run reverse . after our son tried tried find somewhere ( besides patio ) play this toy outside no avail , he walked up me said , " we need take this toy back store--it junk . " this retailed target $29.99 , but clearance $19.99 . now we know why .	-1

my husband i bought this our son christmas who 8 months old time . we never bought vtech toy before , but christmas we bought 3 . 3 , 2 broken within 2 months after christmas . first one broke 2 weeks after christmas . i po'd because this not cheap toy . my son nothing break toy . he never broken toy he dozens fisher price toys some leapfrog . page center changes modes stopped worked all sudden out blue . we tried exchanging it toys ' us 4 times , they never got any back stock . i tried e-mailing vtech customer service my e-mail returned saying e-mail doesn't exist ?! aside all , issue babies ' hands fingers getting wedged under pig ridiculous . it shouldn't passed safety checks . i wish i realized this when i bought it , though i admit my son never tried stick his fingers there . he only tapped pig front make it swing . voice isn't bad . it didn't bother me all , but because i expect house full noise toddler around . final note , my son enjoy this toy very much month or two . now , 4 months later , he doesn't even bother look it or kicks it away if i give it him . save your money !!	1
i don't know what took me so long write this review , but we received this gift our son last year when he 7 months old , he loved it right away . we not . you've probably already read this here dozen times other reviews , but first foremost , it kinda dangerous . swinging pig just enough room little fingers get wedged , i only figured out when i saw my son stick his fingers there , notice they sort wedged , yank them back out his own . lovely . other problem ? guy singing so terribly off key it hurts my ears listen . what kind idiot green-lights toy their company off-key singer ? if you're trying foster musical aptitude your little one , this isn't toy you . issue , toy flips number color mode simply hitting theh " piano " key twice . so , you get one , red , blue , five ; rather than one , two , three or red orange yellow . not such big deal , ok . but then there issue orange pig . see , piano keys say yellow like sun or blue like pond . i guess they couldn't come up withh anything orange , so they made pig orange . only thing ... pigs pink . my son tired this toy now , thank goodness , cuz i'm tired supervising him so his fingers stay squish-free . please , folks , i'm telling you , you don't want this one	-1
i think this toy great , my son recieved it his first birthday . first he wasn't all thrilled but time when his interest skill pushing things wheels grew so they this toy . little door back really inrested him , he loves just opening closing , putting blocks inside hual around , nice gripped handle great too . really child friendly shapes textures , colors etc . he easliy carry it push train around enjoys pushing it construction dump truck one he well . he almost two now , still plays these . even though now he well put his older brothers thomas tank engine inside	1

entire line geotrax road ' ' rail toys great kids ages 2 1/2 up . they promote imaginative play creative design , they're attractive solidly-constructed , etc . however , while some add-ons better conceived than others , rocky falls tunnel among best . set consists hard plastic arched junction two flexible fabric lengths tunnel . these tunnel pieces detachable so they used separately or part this set . however , when they're not attached main base , it looks unfinished , i.e. you definitely tell pieces removed . also , when using fabric tunnel pieces any capacity , they're very picky curves - train oftentimes get stuck tunnel if it not used straight section track . so , it best use t-intersection middle straight tracks coming out all sides . set unfortunately includes no track pieces . set operation controlled train passing through , but not traditional geomotion way . when train passes through , it trips light sensor under archway which triggers water wheel well some cool sound effects . sounds include both train nature effects ; set randomly selects which sounds play each pass-through . set also occasionally throws out random nature sound even when train isn't coming through , which adds fun atmosphere overall landscape . sounds well-recorded volume just right . when completely assembled , set large side ( just shy roundhouse or mile high mountain base comparison ) , so plan your geotrax layout growing when you add falls . overall , this add-on lot fun versatility it offers makes it great addition anyone geotrax collection . pros * motion-sensor trigger sounds actions works very well * sound effects fun pleasant * detachable fabric tunnel pieces also fit into each other use elsewherecons * flexible fabric tunnels picky when used curved tracks * when fabric tunnels removed , main piece looks unfinished - why not include hard plastic caps look like rocks	1

this fantastic jump o lene . mine lasted over year ( cat house ) . come folks , why would you buy one these indoor jumpers then take it outside then complain it ? would anyone put together bedframe outside then try bring it inside ? this not tonka car ; it big , borderline obnoxious but totally fun jump o lene . kids love it . i this exact model couple years ago kept it inflated hand pump ( not recommended ) . whats really nice each octagon self contained so leak won't deflate entire jumper . two concerns you ponder : 1 . it big cumbersome inflate/ deflate it hard find place store it . 2 . chemical components pretty nasty prior magically transformed into plastic state . but if you indulge this one buy	1

we picked one these up our daughter when she started trying sit up her own . she wanted so badly sit up without our help , but didn't strength or balance it , so we figured this seat would help her , while giving her sense independence it . it worked beautifully ! it took only week or two using this seat ( 15-20 minutes day ) before she started able sit up without it ! some things we noted , though : 1 ) when we first started using it , we watch her carefully . she very small , used turn sideways it , putting one leg up over side , while other stayed put . she never got hurt or anything , but it frustrating her . this problem short-lived , however , only lasted first few days , until she developed better sense balance . 2 ) we wait while after feeding our daughter put her this . she would lean forward try reach her toys , pressing her belly into part seat comes up front . sometimes she would lean forward so far it would push her belly make her spit up if she just recently eaten . ( our daughter difficulty spitting up anyway , so other kids might not problem , but still i think it worth noting ... ) seat very easy clean though , so it no biggie perspective ... just bit annoyance us our daughter . 3 ) once she mastered art sitting up , she started trying kick her feet forward while pushing down , see if she could move seat backward . it not slide , though ... it tipped . she almost fell backwards few times doing this , we very glad we there catch her . she padded surface safe environment , so wouldn't gotten hurt anyway , but it probably would given her good scare if she actually fallen all way back . still , even these experiences , i recommend this seat ! i not know if other seats this type market would better any these regards , but i thought this seat just fine its purpose , especially since we only needed it such short while . big thing remember it -- this true all things this nature -- it needs used parental supervision	1
my 4 year old plays hard his toys . after 2 months intense daily play clay , dirt , sand , water , concrete scrambler great condition . i'm truly surprised it holds up so well . magnet holds trailer which flips over reveal bob tools only accessory take alongs my son thinks worth hauling room room , in/out bathtub , outside . its worth while toy	1

bubble machine absolute hit children party . it worked well produced lots bubbles flew through yard . there only one downfall . when wind didn't take bubbles into flight , they would pop concrete . this made concrete extremely slippery dangerous childern playing around machine . it just needed little more powerful blow bubbles further . after we moved machine , all fine	1
my sister i couldn't wait get this bubble machine because my twins girls her daughter love bubbles . when you get burnt out blowing million bubbles ... let this machine it you , lol ! kids so much fun chasing bubbles all over yard . only downside machine it uses almost entire big bottle bubbles dollar store it blows out so many bubbles spits soap so fast , you adding more soap like 15 minutes after you start machine . good thing bubbles came dollar store so we could buy bulk . we love this bubble machine know you too	1

first i thought these where greatest invention since legos mega blocks but after playing them i slightly disappointed . i really would given it 5 stars if they weren't hallow inside . also you really need buy least 2 or 3 sets since you really can't build much anything 22 blocks . then there problem storage . pros : -soft yet durable ( feels like smooth foam)-great colors-light weight easy hold-comes clear plastic container . it tight squeeze get them all back . i would look something else store them if they going used daily basis . most children no patience put them back exactly same way every time . cons : -they hollow inside so they don't `snap ' together like mega blocks or legos . -each piece must sit directly top same size block or bigger block otherwise it tip over	1

this joystick system much better than first 5-in-1 ms. pac-man joystick system two reasons : 1 ) control much better 2 ) it saves your high scores . ms. pac-man almost identical arcade version , more challenging than many " late-model " ms. pac-man super-fast ms. pac-man slower ghosts . previous 5-in-1 model this joystick serious control problems , it times almost impossible play ms. pac-man because controller . namco improved joystick responsiveness so it what you tell it . although i still noticed some problem it turning down unexpectedly , it vast improvement . galaga fantasic easier play new base . also , namco added memory game so it save your high scores posterity , which one drawbacks 5-in-1 system . other games : pole position plays just like original arcade game but not fun other , newer racing games ; xevious fun five minutes but that it ; bosconian mappy aren't worth playing ( anyone even remember these arcade ? ) . if this joystick dig-dug ( pac-man controller ) it would perfec t.t his great game anyone who grew up fan these games , it also great younger kids who appreciate simplicity ease-of-control " classics . " my 5 year-old nephew loves this well .	1

alphabet nesting stacking blocks great ! not only it teach children sizes space recognition it helps them learn their abc . educational fun these blocks provided lots fun my 2 year old . only downside they made paper not wood - which perfectly clear description . so , if you child chews things you should watch him/her carefully so they don't eat blocks while playing ! ;)	1

my son loves these toys ! i purchased them target clearance one dollar 90 some odd cents . what deal ! i went several target stores area found different pieces no more than three dollars . my son 2 � great dexterity start but these taught him even more skills using screw drivers , wrenches other little tools included set . my concern he could possibly fall metal tools hurt himself but now he careful them . i am also not overly pleased play sets but trucks themselves lots fun . play sets seem little cheap but die cast trucks worth money , so me makes up lack imagination designers part . he sit play them hours end , mixing matching different parts different trucks . this purchase well worth money , i just wish i would noticed them before now . this would make great gift toddlers .	1

hi . i recieved this doll my 6th christmas . she adorable . now i'm 12 . doll still cute ever , but mine stopped working when i 9 . me my mom tried everything , new batteries , shaking her little , but nothing worked . i very dissapointed . i haven't able play her years . i still don't know why she stopped working , it just wierd . me . but what cheered me up while i zapf creation.com today , i saw where new talking chou chou coming out soon . doll amazing . she says " i love you mommy , your best mom ever !

i bought rock-a-bye chou chou my 4 year old daughter christmas . she hardly left it alone entire week ! she really loves it treats it just like real baby . we dug out all my daughters old baby clothes our amazement all her 0-3 month outfits fit chou chou perfectly ! we saving money because now we don't need buy special outfits chou chou . me neatest thing it she wearing my daughters baby clothes which brings back so many memories . i think this doll very nice looking - but pictures posted customer amazon deceiving . chou chou doesn't any hair her eyes blue , not brown . i hope amazon comes realize this error something it , people expecting doll hair . some people say young children may get frustated doll , but my experience my 4 year old i not agree . she developed her mothering skills over last week i come admire her patience when doll cries . she talks so tenderly lovingly pats her back get her calmed down . it so sweet watch her interaction chou chou . i purchased many dolls my daughter past - but no doll ever developed so many responses my daughter . i am very glad i got it her !! she glad , too !!	1

i bought moon sand set my 4 year old nephew christmas . well , within minutes him opening it , i found myself setting it up him play . carrying case/play surface blowup which little difficult inflate , luckily air compressor available . there no way he could inflate this his own . but once it up , fun began . play area wasn't big it appeared pictures commercials i seen . but it didn't seem bother my nephew . moonsand it easy work . all you need squish it together until it easy work stays together similiar putty or clay . i ended up much fun he . molds come it good too . though sometimes sand hard get out them without it falling apart . it takes couple tries until you get feel it . sand little messy , if it not squished enough it literally like sand flies everywhere . i ended up covering table plastic keep it getting all over things . clean up easy though , what get carpet or own clothes easily swept up . when we playing we simply put all sand molds case , velcroed it shut it ready take anywhere . overall , it big hit my nephew . successful gift sure !!	1
both my girls loved this toy . i needed something keep them busy when i went out town i bought this toy they spent hours playing together this set . what i like most it all stuff comes it fits inside it it easy them clean up their own	1
i bought this christmas so we could try different sort game . reviewer mentioned , directions sort vague . gamepiece big plastic thing looks like flying saucer . one side there hole your hand ( draped plastic material , so you can't see ) , other side there window . top , there 30 second timer . when timer , light comes inside flying saucer so anyone looking through window see what going . game comes cards pieces . game cards sets pictures them . example , sea creature card would picture seahorse squid it . you spread these cards around flying saucer , face down , then put corresponding pieces ( i.e. seahorse squid ) inside flying saucer . play game , you spin ring around bottom flying saucer . ring pointer it , whichever card it stops , you flip over . set timer , then stick your hand into flying saucer feel around objects shown card . it not clear me whether you supposed get all items listed card 30 seconds or just one them . we've change few rules . we only use half cards items . my five-year-old doesn't like timer . it doesn't ring or anything , it just makes him nervous so we don't use it his turn . we allow one o-o ver per turn . my kids ( ages 5 7 ) play this together ( without parents present ) without fighting . they focus more fun feeling around objects or helping each other saying " hot " or " cold " than they winning or losing . sometimes they even play themselves . i feel like it money well spent , because touch both game toy . materials appear good quality too .	1
my 5 year old received this game christmas . although we found directions little vauge , we enjoyed playing it our own way . you definitely challenge your sense touch , which so often overlooked . you set rules make game harder or easier depending who playing . game durable but it would very easy lose little pieces which would ruin game pieces so unique . directions make no mention ordering individual pieces may get lost . i would recommend this game families who enjoy playing lots different games together	1
my 9 6 year olds love these ! they version 2 3 . this yellow one my sons it blue it too . version 2 version 3 connect each other even though 3 newest version ( coming out march ) . we got ebay since they weren't available anywhere any version stores . games version 3 different characters too . there more than one snacks treats , version 2 only one . you get souveniers passwords version 3 , not version 2 . it like taking care pet , including fact they die you get new pet pressing reset . you get boy or girl , but you can't pick , each time you reset . big it means you need new battery , which $3 . this new hot craze , elementary school kids playing them during recess bus lines . educational part it responsibility end learning how feed , nurse sick ones , let them sleep etc . otherwise , no educational value i see . they get addicted like video game they check them regularly	1
we love game . board came apart after 3 or 4 uses . game pieces stickers plastic . i know everything made china but it poorly made	-1
i bought this game lonely evenings my gf . we both 26 we play lots card games more . rules very , very poorly explained after playing game twice , we not even sure we got everything right . rules definitely lack examples visual details . definitely not recommend game , mine end up yard sale this coming spring . could good family-oriented customers , but not provide any excitement " young adults " alai	1

my daughter great time playing online her new friend . she loves stuffed animals , but additional interactive piece makes it worth money . she learning " earning " money " paying " things . she reading lot website worries taking care her little charge . games diverse enough even her 12-year-old brother enjoys some ones challenging her . its nice little stuffed dog too	1
we love this hat . it excellent quality very easy adjust . it lovely soft lining looks very authentic . when my 3 year old firefighter took it out wrapping , he said : " now i fight fires because i this fireman hat ! " this style hat better than rigid plastic versions , my opinion .	1

each my three kids received one these players christmas love them . i think they pretty cool myself but major gripe operation this toy . we exchange one three right after christmas because players video screen would not work some time even though sound still playing disc . new one seems operate ok ( so far !! ) but now one other two players my kids received now acting just like first one we exchange this one . i'm going put complaint hasbro see if they can't ship these units better failure rate . my kids absolutely love them but if they don't operate properly , well ........? you dedcide	-1
i prefer lilani , but kiani cute too . they both long brown hair lilani brown eyes but kiani however bright blue ones . lilani comes pink black striped t-shirt " zipper " top netting sleeves . she blue jeans cuffed reveal silky light blue material . belt light blue glittery . her shoes black mary janes red decorations . kiani comes light blue ribbed tank top black ribbon sleeves decoration . her skirt blue plaid pattern black , pink , green . her belt pink . her shoes blue gym shoes orange decoration . i definietley reccomend these dolls . you'll lot fun them	1
if you're fan bratz babyz , interested checking out new kidz line , this great place start ! each sister comes her own purse , well matching outfit their original outfits . earrings removable , interchangable , so i wouldn't reccomend it 4 year old , but 6-7 should ok this item . while kiani could considered lost bratz babyz hair flair friend , her outfit exactly like her original , exception shoes . lilani pleasant surprise , after running bit water through her hair rid stiff crimping gel (?) she absolutely perfect , right now her mary janes . while kiani looks exactly like her promo pic , lilani far prettier than shown image , her hair loose , rather than tied back . accessories , aside purses , include two barrettes : small , silver butterfly barrette well pink , star shaped sparkly one could easily used your child hair . kiani sports usual babyz bottle , well her own monkey . this must buy any bratz fan , if only lilani , andretails most stores around $25(but i found mine 21.29 ) lilani , far , prettiest kidz girl out so far , your little one won't able put her down ! while you may hate or love original bratz , kidz actually look like their target market , each beautiful must ! all all , they great investment hours fun . happy hunting !	1

reward milestone accomplishment , my daughter requested toy camera . make good my promise , i began searching good camera buy . believe it or not , this far more difficult task than it sounds ! most i found actual real 35mm film cameras . others digital quite expensive fragile 3 year old . we found little tykes one local tru shape monkey face . it pictures animals view finder changed every time you pushed button made noises comments based what kind animal shown . it even winked each time you pressed button . it seemed kind cool , but when i showed it my daughter , she'd nothing it . " it not camera , it monkey , mommy ! " she also didn't like fact it made sounds . bottom line , she wanted toy looked more or less like real thing didn't pretending her , this one fit bill . it requires no batteries , it actually looks like camera , not some cutsie rendition camera . fact it actually spits out polaroid-like pictures bonus my daughter , since she plenty fun playing just camera . any toy , there some plusses minuses , i'll attempt list them here : plusses : 1 ) most " realistic " toy camera i've found2 ) not need batteries3 ) no annoying noises ! hooray ! 4 ) pictures laminated inserts plastic frame . these pictures turned over drawn crayons ( subsequently wiped off ) , or simply replaced family photos . 5 ) extremely durable . this toy dropped several times even fallen husky friend , doesn't look worse wear . 6 ) strap so camera worn around neck ( my daughter liked this feature ) . minuses : 1 ) button eject pictures little hard push little fingers first . my daughter her friend eventually got it , but only after hour or so fiddling playing it . putting three or four pictures time instead maximum five seems make button little easier push . ( probably main reason i didn't give this toy five stars)2 ) there slight learning curve load pictures into camera . my daughter her friend eventually got it , but they still needed little help time time . 3 ) strap goes around child neck safety break it . this good safety feature , but problem it it breaks if child starts jumping around . this isn't big problem , since all you need snap bead back together . so there it . this good toy child active imagination wants things just like mommy or daddy , but not so good one who expects lot bells whistles . hope this helps	1
this great sippy cup . one nice feature i hadn't aware when i bought it it skid-proof bottom . my only " complaint " there no ounce marker lines cup	1

there seems some confusion around which stock x-23 which variant . unless toy biz now stocking varaints 3 every one standard figure , black one variant . several stores i've seen 3 or 4 purple outfit , only 1 , if any , black . some this confusion proably stems card back . figure pictured there much closer black version , but closer inspection reveals it not actually either . body sculpt identical both figures , it heads paint ops different . pictured most likely earlier prototype . ( there even discalimer effect card back right next upc code . ) bishop variant doesn't scarf pictured card back , iron fist flipped ( dragon going wrong way , well hands wrong sides ) . graphic designer either made mistake or working earlier versions figures , either way , purple much more common . i previously stated , both x-23 use identical body sculp t.t he purple version head scuplt wilder hair , expression give her much more feral look . i believe eyes supposed brown , like wolverine . included comic book nightcrawler observes their eyes identical . black version straighter hair , much colder dangerous look her . green eyes , overall look taken her appearance x-men : evolution . she great figure , well female figue . toy biz tendency past overacentuate certain female attributes make figure look like girl . not so her . she looks like scrawny teenage girl ( claws her hands feet ) . both figures good , it up you which version you prefer . both come head apocalypse , 5 6 figures variant , you build two apocalypses only one duplicate figure	1

last year i told myself i would never , ever buy my children thomas train set . they expensive ! , our town library one must cost hundreds hundreds dollars -- more incentive all us go there . since my kids enjoyed set our library so much , i softened my position thomas looked into modest , figure-8 set additional locomotive . when this 60th anniversary set sale 25% off during holidays , it only $15 more than figure-8 set(about $40 ) additional locomotive small car ( $20 ) ... which not bad since it included thomas , two box cars , henry his coal car , station , covered , elevated bridge , stop go station , more interesting track layout . my kids absolutely love this thing ! , i love playing it much they ( or without them) ! they favor this toy over everything else they received this holiday . best part my son daughter enjoy it equally . my kids still very young i am excited they get more pieces their set over years instead large , cheap , miscellaneous toys they forget clutter our house . so far , it only toy i forsee saving my grandchildren . i love everything this toy .	1

we bought this dollhouse , because when we went store , it adorable display looked like step up twintime dollhouse , which very small rooms . you could press button display , people would talk each other . my kids thought it would great . when we toys us , i looked accessory furniture/people/animal sets go this dollhouse . i not see any . i thought it probably due christmas just passed . we got home , opened dollhouse discovered there really not many phrases provided people/furnitureanimal , so i went amazon try find more sets order achieve purpose this dollhouse ( get 200 phrases ) . thats when reality set we just made huge mistake . you cannot find any accesory pieces this set . you go ebay pay many times more than original price used furniture . i really disappointed . i even tried fisher price website , only find they marketing twintime dollhouse furniture this sweet sounds dollhouse . what shame sham .... i really like fisher price toys we many , but i am very disappointed fact they trying fool consumer . what good dollhouse , if you cannot get it accomplish what it says it --- 200 phrases . not mention , what included sweet sounds dollhouse not much . just mom , dad , girl , baby , swing , cradle , radio , cat , scant few more pieces . definately not enough keep kids interested long ! there actually three fisher price dollhouses still available , this one , twintime dollhouse , one we eventually ended up buying value city ( also available ebay) -- fisher price special edition townhouse . it doorbell rings , doors open , birds sing , phone rings , lights come , fridge light comes , computer lights up(and part desk set attached dollhouse ) , fireplace crackles lights up ( which also attached dollhouse ) . these things all dollhouse itself . no accesory furniture or people needed make this happen . battery replacement compartment back this dollhouse not bottom , like sweet sounds one . front townhouse flower boxes likelike flowers you place them ( comes set ) . you get it lot cheaper than sweet sounds dollhouse , too ( almost half cost ) . it comes great deal furniture : 2 beds pillows comforters blankets , lawnchair , 3 people , potted plant , real curtains , kitchen table chairs , clothing people , computer chair , lounge chair more . kitchen counter , stove , microwave fridge part dollhouse . it also closet doors open stairs people walk up . you practically not need buy anything else , but if you , you get loving family accesory people furniture sets . this dollhouse so much larger boot . there plenty room put everything . it shuts closes together just like sweet sounds , but it clearly larger . we also thought twintime , but it too many comments how small rooms display toys us looked jammed packed . i not know how more than one child could play it not shoving match , because they could not play , well . my kids absolutely townhouse all its sounds , especially doorbell . great thing it these greatly reduced price , because they older model , which what they should sweet sounds dollhouse . let public know ahead time , so their kids not get disappointed , because it not live up what it says store . thank goodness i able take mine back , because i my receipt box . careful keep box receipt if you choose buy this dollhouse even after all warnings , because after your kids see it not what it says because it small side compared townhouse version , they may not want keep it . when we took ours back , toys us worker stopped talked us agreed fisher price just trying get rid their extra stock sweet sounds dollhouses . unfortunately , it consumers expense disappointment !!	1
i am very disappointed this produc t.t he volume not adjustable , default sound setting so loud it heard room , even door closed . electronic toy voices occasionally annoying or difficult understand , this case here . so , needing something repeated ... loudly ... " get your nerves " . i more careful future not assume all speaking electronic toys come adjustable volume . buyers beware !	-1
like many overhead gym type toys , this one turns out short or legless babies . when my daughter kicks kickplates , she kicks toy right away her ( this carpet ) , when we brace toy against something , she kicks herself right out under toy . we found same true number similarly designed toys . now we looked box more closely , baby picture his/her legs bent really hard order baby fit under toy . our daughter 3 1/2 months old already too big this . positive note , this very well made toy all other respects . looks durable , all chicco toys , music lights pleasant . negative : you apparently push two hanging toys get them activate sound lights , most babies want pull them . might good tummy toy , but we're not waiting that--we'll try chicco 3 1 gym instead , it appears much better bang buck not kick plate	1

i purchased this my 2 boys , 5 3 , february . got it clearance walmart $19 , but would not wanted spend much more it . i debated whether get this or kitchen made cooking sounds but didn't speak 3 languages , since we're trying raise our children bilingual ( least ! ) we thought talking kitchen would preferable . unfortunately , voices hard understand - not they're soft , but there seems lot mumbling static , so if you don't know exactly what voice saying already , you wouldn't able learn , example , spanish word bacon " tocino " - it sounds more like " poseena " . beyond , however , both boys enjoyed it . it little small 5-yr old now but they both still play it . they occasionally get frustrated only cookie sheet fit into oven ( you can't put pot or nearly any other cooking vessel our other playsets ) . reason this obvious- sensor talking feature top oven , thus order close enough food sensor respond whatever there , floor oven raised rather high . if i it again , i would probably look kitchen set only cooking sounds not talking feature , it just not used often this house .	1

i would rated this lower , but idea so great . my 7yo loves his book . careful w/ pages you submit . we ordered two books first book contains original submitted pages w/ artwork ( except cover which scanned reprinted " glossy " paper ) . 2nd book , course , all photocopied pages firs t.t hey simply take your submitted artwork pages someone ( or possibly ocr ) , prints your submitted text just under your drawings ; then binds pages into book , title page , dedication page , etc . not sturdy book i thought it should , but i said , my kid loves it , so that what matters most . lt ; grin	1
my daughter got this birthday gift really likes playing it . she loves palying animals this perfect fit doll house she recieved christmas . she still playing it several months later	1
box said it came 10 refillable paint containers , but ours only 9 bottles , one those empty . no matter , really , it just small amount paint start , but why not give people what you tell them you ? color selection all right , but not super - you don't get roygbiv or anything . it may vary , course , but we lot light green . some them glitter , which extra cool good job making whole picture sparkle if you add it last . it also comes small assortment ( 40 pieces ) paper -- both large small sizes -- which you encouraged reserve last one template trace make new ones . poster board seems same thickness original paper . smaller " bonus " machine go fast if you pump button down repeatedly . doing this , it actually go faster than battery operated one paint distributes spatters very well . instruction manual , if you call it , pretty limited . it shows 3 pictures how put everything together operate it . no tips or hints how make neat designs . it least detailed set instructions i seen art toy . it comes apart easy rinsing/wiping . i've always this immediately after paint session , units still clean they first time out box . my kids love it . they want spin pictures every day	1

we bought game thinking it would just like real life game , but sponge bob characters . it very simplified version game . it geared towards young children . game , if you run out money , you just keep playing , you exempt pay any fees , while people money , still keep paying ... so you actually better off if you lose your money early game . ( bugs me)as far spinner goes ... it snaps , you press hard get it click into place , it works great . just little disappointed , just remember , it little kids . if you love game life , get original one ... my older kids want me buy original one , they don't care sponge bob version .	1
this puzzle great , i'm glad i bought it my 2 year old , claire . however , like most toddlers , she prefers things her size . i find hands this puzzle slim adult sized hands , like my own . maybe makers felt " mommy " sized hands way go , or simply they wanted fill space standard sized wooden puzzle . i think it would nice make hands toddler sized , chubby palms fingers . said , it great tool . we don't use it much counting , though it intent . this more prop song fest " where thumbkin " even more exciting prop game " dr. claire " wherein she repairs " owie hand " . all all , fine addition your wooden puzzle collection	1
i bought this my 8 11 year old girls extre inexpensive christmas gift , i pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it	1
my twin boys ( 16 months ) love this toy . i would suggest getting least 100 extra balls . ( i 250 our ball pit it really looks fun )) connections aren't best , but they work better than other company models don't velcro straps . our kids play this off most day . cautionary note , this fairly large system tunnels tents so make sure you plenty room . course , you use pieces separately make several smaller play spaces instead one large area . overall , i am glad i purchased this i didn't wait until recommended 3 year old age range .	1
i bought this computer my just turned 5 year old . while he thinks it really cool , it bit hard him . 26 games , he play 6 . i am happy it toy he grow it teach him lot . graphics great but i wish volume could turned down one more setting . i wish there setting they could just type letters learn keypad . all all , good investment .	1

shopping puzzles over last few years i've noticed manufacture age recommendations seem bit off . when puzzles too advanced , simple solution put it up later date ; however , when they too simple , they're waste money . unfortunately , alphabet art puzzle one those disappointments . puzzle encourages thinking , matching , but i'm not sure it helped teach alphabet . addition , some images too goofy this age group . instance , piece rope shaped into letter " , " but 3-year old don't associate such thing . example this , letter " " yarn . wouldn't yo yo better solution ? raised pieces offer new motor challenge plastic knobs , but they too shallow board . i can't seem move this puzzle without dropping several pieces floor . my son found this frustrating well . what more , i think age recommendation needs adjusted . i purchased alphabet art puzzle when my son 2-years 4-months old . it recommended children 3-years up , so i thought it would make good choice . it didn't challenge him all . second time he worked it , he completed it less than 4-minutes himself . said , my son benefited puzzle . he likes working it , continues ask questions pictures . i recommend it children 18-months up , they find it more challenging than 3-year old .	1

if you your friends just too crazy conventional board games , give i've never - game truth try . object game simple , players move around board answering highly personal potentially defamatory questions , take shots or drink beer while playing . questions formatted " i've never .... " ( example , " i've never skinny-dipping " ) . if this true you , you get move forward designated number spaces . if it false , you pay consequence ( generally you must take drink ) . some spaces game board automatically force you drink . many people find questions far too offensive overly personal , uncomfortable playing this game . if this you , don't feel bad , you're not only one . however , group close friends , this game total laugh riot . this game perfect bachelor or bachelorette party , or just regular party group friends who crazy you	1

this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1

both me my kids learned so much this toy . we rarely start our children out real items until they understand fake ones first . therefore , we slowly going over each inch this toy explaining bits pieces our children . what fun ! we even made model peach pillows push toy out . it really taught them lot . eventually , we moved art touching playing it . it really neat when we gave little robert his first real piece explore . he so experienced ! i believe it because he so much practice toy first ! thank you , ' doggie it!' you really helped us learn play our poop family now we truly closer than ever before . if only jimmy hadn't succumbed awful problem dissentary , he could here little robert josiah . jimmy never talented other 2 quick regurgitation , which necessary avoid ingestion too much fecal matter , obviously . so buy this toy	1

this toy lots fun . i like play it using my old gijoe toys . my favorite scenario sigmund freud kill off cobra commander , then take his place leader cobra : enemy . his cigar , he works really well evil villain . ( plus , he likes torture good guys they capture tying them up putting his cigar out their bare chest . ) it lots fun play . final battle usually takes place rug foot my bed ( which substitutes jungle ) , where snake-eyes challenges sigmund freud duel order avenge death duke all other joes . ( snake-eyes always only surviving joe left . ) sigmund freud then tries some ninja moves kick snake-eyes ' rear , but snake eyes beats crap out him . it finally ends snake eyes using his sword gut sigmund freud , his sword slowly slides out his bloody entrails . it really lot fun ! sometimes i transformer crossover universe , where megatron comes sigmund freud join him some plot obtain energy order build ultimate weapon take control universe . joes always go get help optimus prime , who always puts stop this plot just last minute , but not before his arm gets chopped off battle . ( i am actually missing optimus ' arm real life , so that why this always happens story . ) anyways , sigmund freud great fun whole family ! especially 10-year-olds ( above ) . buy it today	1

i really enjoyed seeing my 3 children enjoying this toy . all three under 5 years so this perfect fit . i said , fun kids . putting this together easier common sense than confusing instructions . this product made plastic semi durable springs . front end loader good my son carrying my daughters toys away them , but not feasible doing much good when outside . ( i mean , thats what tractors , playing dirt . ) tires not good grass , they slip not get grip . it becomes family pushing toy instead one driven chain . i say it fun children , i give it 5 stars fun . it around , durability wise , we see ..	1

what i say . this fantastic game . you know when you keep seeing movies often disappointed keep waiting blockbuster . well , wit end blockbuster . i can't tell you how much fun we playing this game . it trivia knowledge based game but twist . not only you challenged questions , but question types make game even more interesting . there four different card categories which ask different types questions . teaser category , asks you figure out relationship ; sequence category asks you put people , places things sequence ; odd-1-out category asks you decide which thing not belong wild card category many different types fun question types . if great categories where not enough , questions cover great range knowledge ; including pop culture , music , literature , geography , history ; science .... just everything ! better yet , there detailed answers every question . so you not just left one world answer , but explanation . you actually learn thing or two interesting facts details . questions smart ( real smart ! ) , not dumbdown version other trivia games . i cannot stress you how fantastic this game .... if you up challenge	1

( it seem little-sister-proof ) it even tells her how many " intruders " tried open journal . pen radio gets few stations depending where she walking house - only downside radio i can't hear what she listening unless i'm always checking her . shredder pen manual tiny pieces paper only - which seems perfect whatever shredding 8 year old girl want . there way set journal easier get into - more sensitive setting really very sensitive - we reset password several times when it wouldn't recognize her password - but problem resolved when set less sensitive . ( easier mom get into without setting off intruder alert ....	1

my son 18 months old loves piano . he sit front it hours ( something toy yet ) . even his older brothers ( 8 yr old twins 14 yr old ) play it show him how what . demo mode best ... he press it just dance laugh . so far it holding up banging constant playing . we love it !	1
this cute , easy game play . i bought this one my son few years ago it still big hit . it fun keeps him giggling . he asked play few times row , because it short adventure . i think if your little one scared monsters his room this helps ease his fear . when they happen pick monster out sack ... they say ~ go away monster pitch it into box ... i make up little things say when this happens . i highly recommend this game , not hard really you don't need directions ... explain it once they it . great buy	1
i would not recommend this toy . my 10 month old son able break off one 4 knobs bottom toy . i found piece clenched his hand while he asleep , we very fortunate he didn't put it his mouth . these knobs when broken off choking hazard .	-1
this toy seems okay , but my 13 month old son isn't interested . music sounds also somewhat annoying	1

my son ( currently approaching 15 months ) totally obsessed cars trucks , pretty much time he old enough hold toy car his hand . even car ads tv drive him crazy joy . compulsive shopper , i buy him toy cars trucks all time . :) out all his toys , this set may his favorite . he loves zoom cars across floor ( they roll very easily , even carpet ) also take them apart put them together . it little hard pull first piece off when taking them apart , so his mom or i help him , but it ok -- he take second piece off put them back just fine . ( we sometimes use his other mega bloks put together big crazy vehicles using parts these three trucks -- it hard see picture , but each truck consists two top pieces chassis piece , all which connect up any other mega bloks . ) same token , they very sturdily put together . he course throws them drops them floor sometimes , because they hard plastic , they make very loud noise tile , but there hasn't so much hairline crack . i see them lasting until he outgrows them . set seem little expensive amount stuff you get ( we actually bought it much less discount store ) , but hindsight , my son loves this toy so much it so sturdily built it would worth retail price .	1
this teaches both color shape recognition , while fun toy bath . my son loves bath time , any time i make it fun learning time , it good thing .	1
my grandson polar express train expert . he very disappointed train didn't really look like movie train . he liked whistle , but very expensive whistle .	-1
you deal cards , show green apple card , everybody turns red apple card , hilarity ensues . each hand inspires discussion chuckles . i liked variations suggested instructions , such dealing all green ( adjective ) cards finding best match red ( noun ) card , or trying find least-fitting match , or just turning red card blindly before seeing what green card says . judge determine how play hand , my favorite part , decision judge completely arbitrary , meaning you pick whichever card you like . it easy , fun , game long or short you like . there lot shuffling involved , since you go through lot cards quickly , so someone hand who knows how shuffle deck cards . recommended	1
this item pretty cheap when you buy it target or any store good prices , but it eventually adds up more than it worth . each pvd $8.99 , but only holds 30 min . most ! i got this toy because hasbro.com made it look so cool , but it not worth it . i use it every now then but my dad doesn't spend lot money me there limits . after buying few pvds player , you could dvd player . dvds same price sometimes lower if it sale , hold lot more space . you also make dvds computer ! you make pvds but they hold under 20 min . i am not saying this toy horrible . if you child 8 or younger , video now xp might good way go . good thing it back each pvd , there now point . if you get six or more nowpoints , you get free pvd mail ! one good point it there long waranty . my first one didn't work very well so i got new one . although box you see two kids watching their videonow car , it not good idea unless it warm day . videonow xp sensitive cold could damaged if left cold too lond . think twice before you get it .	1

these cars so much fun ! just name says , you just shake it up it goes . my son several these they all slightly different reactions . some faster than others . they work best hard surface - cement , hardwood floors , tile . they go pretty slow carpet . cars very durable . one my son favorite games launch them off deck see if he get it land grass below . if weather isn't nice , he likes send them racing down stairs . so far , nothing broken its over six months . these cars easy my daughter ( who only two ) play too . kids love shaking cars racing see who car goes farthest .	1

i received this wagon second hand , i'm glad i didn't spend outrageous price charged it . yes , it relatively durable ( although ours literally fell apart under my 2 year old other day . nut holding wagon together worked itself loose our walk whole thing went pieces . replacing nut fixed problem ) , but it also tips easily . handle much too short . i've tie piece rope handle so i reach it without bending over . it really rough ride , my son never looks very comfortable it . all all , i think i'll passing it buying something else . maybe i'm just picky , but i'd rather pay quality , not radio flyer name . *** eta *** please excuse incorrect stars given this product . i'm not sure what happened . i meant give it 1 star , not 5	1

descriptions don't mention creepy voice says " it lullabye time " before it launches into seriously off-key rendition twinkle twinkle firefly ( huh ? there copyright problem using " little star " ? ) you press moon button skip first song , so i didn't too much trouble this- most songs after first mercifully without vocals . later this same robo-mom also says " i love you " , which seriously spooky . aside this , " amazing 3-d ceiling light " really more rotating circular slide projection some cartoon animals , bee-and- led light show actual toy looks really old-fashioned . nature sounds ok , but i am pretty sure one sounds " plank wood tapping against plank wood " . even all this , i still willing strap it my son crib see how he liked it- within first five minutes projector light flickered off , robo-mom got stuck kept saying " it lullabye time " over over .	-1

please oh please not buy this item . my son interested engines i bought this show him how engine works . parts all listed correctly assembled picture looks interesting . assembly engine nothing short maddening . parts not line up correctly , they break if you apply even small amount pressure them worst thing all screws provided . they slightly too large holes they fit into . holes not tapped screws becoming stripped when attempting screw them . i tried smaller screwdriver than one provided but not help . i took out my drill tried widen holes but cast plastic case cracked . i eventually got it all together tried it ..... crap . pistons move up down cylinder but cams not move rocker arms which not move valves . i disassembled it all tried again , spending almost 6 hours massaging parts , adding glue , ensuring contact made using other means holding parts together , but after all ... same result . pistons move up down but all . there just too much slop rest parts actually all move together . don't waste your time .	-1

i got this tricycle my nephew his second birthday . although it may little beyond him , he still dazzled it . seat comfortable enough them stay it adjustable . assembly pretty straight forward simple . i gave it 4 stars because there couple parts seemed little flimsy . rear step press formed little thin . same process used seat . minor defect seat wasn't perfectly square body . since adjustable rod seat squared , when you tighten set screw , it forces it offcenter point . something i noticed , but it not dramatic certainly wouldn't affect ridability . fun toy toddler your life	1
we bought this our three-year-old daughter . i not even know where begin convey my disappointment . this no better than plastic toy lights up you push buttons . first , price unit plus software ridiculous what you actually get . second , software joke . it not intuitive . it not challenging . it hardly interactive . there nothing learned except word " dummy " . voices disturbing diaglogue snippy some times . most time you just sit there watch what little content available each program , instead interacting learning . it actually worse than plopping your toddler front tv . overall concept idea good we very excited it . we expecting learn colors , numbers , letters , lot more interactivity such games , puzzles problem solving . there freeware/shareware available internet far better than this . i'm wondering who consulted when comfy designed this stuff . i early childhood educator 10 years i would never used this my class . software titles we purchased christmas comfyland , joy music , animal world , your neighborhood , world colors . all complete total waste money . i am so sick it . i know i sound harsh , but i don't want anyone waste their money like we .	-1
i love this wagon ! my mom purchased it my 2 sons because my 2 year old hates double stroller . they love this wagon ! my youngest just turned 1 i don't even problem him trying climb out while we're moving . they love sitting like big boys looking out while we walk . lap belts very helpful just case . there little storage compartment behind back seat which great my things . my only ( very small ) gripe sippy cup holders kids down inside wagon their feet . it easy them reach , but they get knocked over roll around bottom . some other models kids cup holder up side . i think i would like better , but it may way there also ... i don't know . it not big deal . my favorite feature canopy . it installs very quickly since we live texas , i use it constantly . handle folds flat easy storage . wagon pretty good size , but it fits fine back my jeep cherokee if we take it us somewhere ( which we constantly ) . i don't know how well it would fit back car trunk . wheels real rubber too so it seems smoother ride than one plastic wheels . i can't think better alternative double stroller . my boys just love it	1

i bought this strawberry shortcake doll my 4 year old daughter christmas . when i little girl strawberry shortcake very popular . marketing re-unveiling strawberry shortcake great timing --- just when i am my own children ( they get us nastalgia ) . anyways , technology this doll reminds me technology available when i growing up 1980 , interaction doesn't work correctly . interactive pen doesn't recognize what page i am half time . page i think most educational , when strawberry shortcake supposed read story , not even programmed . i tried retried make this part work , but it just complete failure . i am pretty disapointed this doll , however , we opted keep it because i got excellent deal it . i would rather spent ten dollars more up-to-date technology actually works . my recommendation wait until next year . maybe company come out higher quality doll	1

hi , names tom , i'm 12 years old i know thing or two kids these days one my self , my parents bought this toy me last christmas it terrible , it took 3 days put up when it got put up every time you tried use it it broke so it took hour set backup . it almost impossible get orange tubes right place when you get it right place they bend back out , so when you drop ball it either misses thing completley or it hits rim bounces out . i highly not reccomend this toy . *************** my toy rating top 100:98 ***************	-1
my 22 month-old son many wonderful abilities , but puzzles , however , not quite his forte . this puzzle he loves ! he concentrates mastering it because he enjoys hearing puzzle sound he places car , motorcycle , airplane , etc . into their correct spaces . sounds clear authentic . your child ( you ) lot fun this . it also great gift	1
this game supposed gift my husband our anniversary . i took my time figuring out " theme " pictures names properties so i actually gave it him 4 months later valentine day when i finally completed it ! don't worry though , it not hugely time consuming - it probably only took me few hours complete once i'd decided everything . it deciding took while . he loves it even wanted play it right then there when he opened it ! it great idea , you make it very personal using your own pictures , etc little creativity thought whoever recipient this gift quite touched you took time put so much thought effort into gift them . only negatives actual game pieces ( different colored cheap plastic pegs)and fact there no houses hotels buy properties . i planning making my own personalized playing pieces out clay then baking it , but would've probably taken me 4 months get around doing ! now we're using pieces old monopoly set we . all all i definitely recommend this game	1
when you first realize series 1 2006 topps baseball card set 329 cards it , numbered 1-330 , you probably think you know which card not included . because wake mickey mantle death several years ago topps decided honor mick retiring card #7 . today we say modern era baseball cards begins 1952 topps set , which mantle card biggie , not just because it his topps rookie card but also because it high number , which jumps value up well . however , there card #7 2006 topps set , it mickey mantle . what kind cool card it just like all other cards set there nothing distinguishes fact mick no longer active except his career stats ending 1968 ( he stole six bases his final season those ruined legs ) . card missing #297 , alex gordon , who turned out not meet new gold standard rookie card . there some cut out versions card floating around out there you want really complete series 1 collection ( opposed four incomplete collections same price ) . intact version sold $ 7,000 because clearly it rarest card around this year . topps cut outs because under major league baseball players association rules former university nebraska star , who second pick last year draft , not sign contract until september . after years baseball cards players who never spend day major leagues , mlpa changed rules so rookie cards now only put out players who make 25-man opening-day roster or played least one major league game year before . topps anticipated gordon would make royals ' 25-man roster , but third baseman assigned wichita instead . solves mystery missing card series 1 . personally , i think this rule change great , because i now complete topps sets 1956-57 , 1961 , 1964-66 , 1968 date ( less than dozen cards each go finish my 1953 , 1958 , 1967 sets ) , i lay out my sets so you see how teams finished each year . so i like see who playing each team each year . granted , difficult today because this set already johnny damon yankees ( #185 ) , but coco crisp ( #12 ) still indian not damon replacement red sox . tom gordon ( #163 ) appears phillie photo back , but his card still says yankee matt morris ( #238 ) seen cardinal front his card giants . main thing when you get rookies series 1 ( cards 296-325 ) you actually find players who major leagues right now , including prohibitive favorite american league rookie year award , francisco liriano ( #309 ) twins . this beats going back couple years looking all rookie cards finding only handful made it show this many years down road . topps set remains set me each year because it one history behind it , so if you feel same way it must your collection . base cards set run #1 ( alex rodriguez ) #242 ( felix hernandez ) , big names manny ramirez ( #50 ) , barry bonds ( #100 ) , pedro martinez ( #150 ) , roger clemens ( #151 ) , ivan rodriguez ( #175 ) , albert puljos ( #200 ) , ichiro ( #225 ) . cards #243 -59 american national league gold glove award winners , set missing a.l. catcher , who not i-rod but jason veritek , who not topps card again this year . we then award winners two leagues cy young , most valuable player , rookie year awards ( #260 -65 ) , followed team cards/managers ( #266 -95 ) . what they doing here interesting , because they teams arranged alphabetically arizona diamondbacks washington nationals , what you hear manager card or team card each , but never both ( e.g. , you get mets manager willie randolph new york yankees team card ) . series 2 , you find appropriate counterparts . mentioned above you rookies ( #296 -325 ) , then team stars ( #326 -30 ) , which pairs up stars yankees , orioles , braves , red sox , cubs .	1

" there not enough spaces put my daughter whole name beginning game , again , no option 2 player so my other daughter could not participate part all ! very disappointing . not mention now , because its opened already , it cannot returned . we enjoy all other games we system , including winnie pooh , dora little mermaid game came vsmile system . i would not recommend blues clues anyone , especially if i like them !	-1

our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear her birthday - unfortunatley , it doesn't work way they claim . i hid it one end house , my daughter began searching opposite end house transmitter said " you're getting warmer ... ( which obviously she wasn't ... ) " . half time she just found bear accidentally without it giving any hints all - it just kept saying comments like " you're fun play " other such statements , but nothing help direct her bears location . she just ended up wandering around house comments coming transmitter mostly haphazard nothing where bear located . so " fun " lasted barely 10 minutes . i would love return it , but we already threw away box ... if your child wants this toy , i would highly suggest you try guide her toward something else	-1

we purchased read me dvd system our 3 year old son christmas . ok , so first , setting up remote took all mabey 10 minutes . then you simply pop one dvd your good go ! this system so much fun , it really brings these familiar stories life . my son previously familiar titles offered we them traditional book form ( nothing should replace reading aloud your children ) , i hope they come out more titles soon . illustrations same ones you find books but they animated , reallly entertaining . narrators voice very clear nice hear . words bottom page light up correspond what narrator saying . $15 dollars you spen each dvd bargain considering each dvd comes 4 different play modes tons questions you your little one answer . my son play system often it usually his attention anywhere half hour hour . someone who studying teacher i like some other educational aspects system other than just reading benefits . when you answer question wrong it prompt you give answer , rather than immeadiately give right answer . when you answer question correctly it goes further explains why answer right . this good tool use conjunction daily reading your children . fisher price definitely got it right	1
this game not high quality it could , all it it simple game . pieces consist little blocks chips , which like really old thin plastic poker chips . all you roll die try get most chips landing them , other people placing blockers hear there get you reaching your goal . i guess game somewhat unpredictable , because anyone land you take all your chips away , but it gets monotonous after while , game just isn't high quality most . overall it alright game , but if you lot other high-quality games ( cranium , monopoly , etc . ) i doubt this you	1

i loved this product ! it relatively easy quick assemble my opinion , it sturdiest wagon market . i one these radio flyer wagons small child , given me my father , i cherished it . buying it again ( it lost move ) adult nostalgic . only caution i would give would-be buyers certain which product you buying . example , i confused this product ( radio flyer big red classic atw ) radio flyer big red classic . ( main difference two models tires . ) i thought i purchased " classic " skinny non-inflatable tires , but instead got this product , " all terrain wheels " , which come inflated . no biggie- this one more practicle , anyways , but if you're concerned getting " original " model , look closely product decriptions .	1

only reason i give 4-star review i wish it tad bit bigger . though most cradles this size , some smaller even . very cute easy assemble . sturdy , too . my daughter loves it . blanket pillow bit " cheesy " , but she tons blankets she plays anyway . overall great purchase	1
my daughter loves balls she loves chewing tags . when my husband i saw this product local toy store we could not wait buy it watch her it . we waiting her play it two months . she just not interested it all . we received other taggies products ( soft books board book ) she not play them either . my daughter loves play spend hours knocking down block towers , chewing books or rolling balls , but she not impressed taggies neither we . however , i took " toss taggie " ball group play date some older toddlers seemed enjoy it	1
i love barbie , especially princess barbies , i very excited when this one arrived mail . however , i surprised find she not look like barbie picture ; her eye make-up fairly harsh , her crown much larger not all delicate , bodice her gown not form-fitting . she not " soft " appearance like i expected her . quality gown doll general very good , but i would recommend seeing this doll person before you purchase her because her appearance really come quite shock me	1
i am big guy , even when i pushed down base our graco seat , i could not get seat installed tight enough . couple clicks mighty-tite all i needed fix ! this device excellent , i can't possibly imagine anyone breaking it like some reported here , device weighs lot ( good thing ) feels extremely sturdy	1
we bought this product when my daughter just over year old , but wish we'd found it sooner . my mother fisher price aquarium light/monitor set , which we used during one our visits . our daughter loved watching light show , but we already baby monitor so when we got home we found tomy star . it great help bedtime , although we disabled music part toy because it irritating just not necessary . we use it nightly only changed batteries once last 9 months . i also like it straps crib , so after it automatically turns off my daughter turn it again if she not ready sleep . room really dark see projection so you'll need blackout shades or heavy curtains if/when baby goes sleep before sunset . we've very happy this product , but i'm only giving it 4 stars because it doesn't switch turn off music ( we disable wires inside )	1
100 pieces little more involved but no means hard enterprising 2-3 year old . i would think fun older kids too . my son enjoyed doing this puzzle 40 times	1
little people christmas wonderful holiday " decoration " little ones - something they learn play too ! but , please look elsewhere before paying inflated prices through this vendor - $99 !!! - deluxe edition still available online fisher price $30 , regular version available toys us online $25 free shipping	1
if i could give this product zero stars , i would . my 3-year-old loves bella dancerella cinderella dvd , she loves cheerleading , so we very excited receive bella cheer video christmas . what horrible disappointment . mat useless , cheering dull , instruction painfully lacking preschoolers . complete waste money waste time . go bella dancerella cinderella sing dance dvd -- entertaining , exciting fun	-1

this tent very difficult assemble disassemble . it broke after only one week use . i highly discourage people purchasing this	-1
my 3 1/2 year old daughter received this christmas gift she loves it . light only stays when she needs it , there storage drawer pegs it runs batteries . it also flat so it takes up very little space . my older children older model which no storage drawer ( didn't fit back box once assembled ) , came no light bulb such short electrical cord kids sit floor near outlet play it . they never ended up playing it , so i got rid i t.t his one so much better ! only improvement make so this toy truly self contained would add pocket pattern sheets . love it would highly recommend it -- just don't forget buy batteries it !	1
what great idea ! we bought this our 3-year old son who talking getting doggie year . it great way get him ready responsiblilities pet . only thing i wish little better batteries seem run out quickly because you can't turn it off ... well if you , you retrain dog . we love it	1

this christmas gift my 3 year old grandaughter . she saw it toy us sunday ad said she wanted santa bring it . she quite taken barbie which surprises me such young age . i probably not let her beads until she older but i'm sure she'll love brushing fixing barbie hair . i can't wait give it her	1
we got this ball pit our 18-month old daughter . we love it ! most importantly though , she loves it ! i picked this one because i don't blow it up , like you would other pits . i also like it not plastic ... plastic ones seemed like suffocation hazard me - although that just my personal opinion . plus - this ball pit huge compared other ones out there . four children could very easily fit there play . my 18-month old daughter stand up it least foot grow ( she tall her age ) . 3 openings ball pit tied up stay open . however , only largest opening velcro close it shut . i think we may add velcro other 2 smaller openings so we could close them if we like . i love it so easy put up take down . it literally springs open folds closed . plus , balls come mesh bag . everyone else right - 100 balls not nearly enough fill up pit . we got extra 100 balls - they just barely fill up bottom my liking . but , extra 100 really all you'll fit ball pit . this leads my only gripe this toy ... bottom pit where 3 openings not very high . so , we're constantly picking balls up put them back into pit because they fall out easily . i don't really feel this small issue affects toy . i still gave it 5 stars , but wanted let other people know it case it affects their decision buy ball pit ( although it shouldn't!) . all all , this such fun toy ! it big , so you need some room it , but it totally worth it	1
i work elementary school we purchased 3 these games rainy day recess . kids love it . it simple enough kindergarteners yet still enough fun 5th 6th graders . it lot like jenga you choose right rod pull out prevent marbles spilling . however , unlike jenga , clean up set up takes just couple minutes . far durability , we've used it during recess over past 3 months it stood test all those children so i would say it going last while .	1

photo description not match this item . photo line now retired unavailable . description ( jane lunger sculptures ) refers newer release totally different picture . also , breyer collectors don't want just guess which model they going get . many us only collect particular molds or colors . give us some choice -- every other breyer dealer out there realizes this sells them separately while allowing choice which model received	-1

my son received " mummy gold " present his 6th birthday , he played it exclusively around 24 hours before even looking his other presents . solid week , he visited mummy every day when he came home kindergarten . completely , unapologetically uneducational it , i see charm toy shouts " who dares wake mummy ? " " i've got you now ! " " you've mummified ! " when car rolls over activating switch . if i toy like this when i kid , i would probably still telling my friends , " you've mummified . " trouble , there really no game play , no challenge , activator switch mummy head broke week after we got it . one month later , my son doesn't even look toy . so i give it overall rating three stars	-1
it lot fun see my son enjoy this much i kid . simple plain fun lots laugh	1
my 4 year old loves it . controller very easy him use . he other rc cars , but controllers just not intuitive this one . my 1 year old loves chase it around house . so it great all way around . i thought 49mhz might not enough , but it just fine . he one end house car other end , even around corner , it still works ok . only issues we following : it loud !!! kids love sounds , but ... it little trick you turn sound off , which i am really thankful . mattel/tyco doesn't make them anymore ! we started some minor trouble truck not wanting go forward or backward , but it would turns flips make loud noises . turns out we just need change batteries . however , when we called mattel/tyco they willing send one , but don't make it anymore . they could send us kind r/c car comparable price , but controller would standard kind not this kid friendly one	1
i am 12 years old . my 9 year old cousin got webkinz showed it my sister i . i thought it stupid first . then my sister bought yorkshire terrier , let me play it . i realized how much fun it , went back store next day bought golden retriever . i made it girl named her ginger . now all my friends want them , too . there games you play , you challenge your friends tournament arena . build your webkinz house , invite your friends their webkinz over . there employment office , you jobs earn money . one most recent additions kinzpost , where you send presents letters your friends . they constantly releasing new webkinz buy real life , virtual items other things you buy webkinz world . curio shop where you buy rare items go gem hunting . you webkinz get sick , so sure you feed him lots fruits vegetables , exercise him , put him bed before logging out webkinz world . if your webkinz become sick , you should take him clinic . even if he isn't sick , you should take him there frequently check-ups . last but definitely not least , there quizzy question corner . there , you choose your age group then choose either math , language , science , health , arts , or social studies . you then asked 50 questions , rewarded kinzcash each question . i think webkinz great any age group , but particularly ages 5-14 years old . it combines computers plush , thus making it one best things around you buy . i recommend it everybody	1

action figure supposed resemblance son god , this toy lame . granted , it kind cool toy jesus , but it not very good toy . other than his arms , figure no flexibilty whatsoever : his legs permanently hidden beneath robe hard plastic his head fixed frozen forward gaze . even though his arms move , they only capable forward backward motion . finally , gliding action feature toy ( meaning little wheels figure base ) more annoyance than anything else . toy coolness factor ten ( it jesus , man ) , but toy it resembles something kid get out one those claw games	1

this most horrible rip off waste money product i ever purchased ! i bought 3 these so my daughter could use pink , blue yellow paints . i spent $45 i'd better flushing my money down toilet ! brushes look like they would hold lot paint- there huge . reality they only hold maybe tablespoon paint . trust me you'll either refilling every 10 seconds just squirt paint bowl let them use it like regular paint brush . paint not easily go onto sidewalk . i no idea how crayola able create drawings their commercial . no child planet no matter how gifted could them using these tools .	-1
this bingo game truly awful . there four different versions game - colors/shapes ; numbers ; animals ; addition/subtraction . each version its own spinner you drop base unit . cardboard which spinners attached warped get go making it impossible get true spins . spinner can't stop all spots because warped cardboard . animal card/spinner broken out box . all all , this cheap toy , unworthy leapfrog name . go traditional bingo game	-1

this great starter set i bought my children . water tower big hit -- it looks like water runs out when you move handle down . set up : younger kids need help putting it together . adults want find safe place keep paper tells you exactly how set it up . it figure 8 shape if you don't put right pieces right place it won't make it all way around . fyi : i also not know thomas train pieces you buy target not fit all thomas tracks	1
this one awesome bus . simply best hot wheels made this scale . those red line tires chrome rims rock !! picture doesn't it justice until you get it see it up close . simple amazing !! buy it you love this one years come !	1
i think my title tip-off my review . when i got this toy , i charged it long it told me , then i tried it . it didn't even sputter . then i tried it again , charged it , since some reason it ran out battery . didn't work . i then tried bouncing beam cieling ufo , no go . i tried launching it middair , it just fell . then i charged it again . seems repetitive , don't it ? then , 5 minutes later , after almost giving up , i tried it , it actually flew , then crushed my hopes stopping falling my face , then it never worked again . just so i prove it wasn't just my ufo , 5 my friends got ufo , similar destructive results . unless you want buy piece styrofome propeller much money than its worth , don't even bother getting it . don't beleive salesmen store actually use it , they get working tested ones	-1

overall i only very good things say . device very durable , much more so many other kids devices get dropped , thrown around , etc . battery life pretty good even without any expansion cartridges there lot you . cartridges you get even more . unfortunately , it hard find them unless you look online , or least it me . only kind negative thing i say it rather bulkly younger kids who it supposed . my son hard time holding it his small hands drawing screen same time . usually this okay . he puts it table or bed he good go , but sitting car it harder him manipulate . it still doable , just bit tricky . one plus/minus depending how you look it batteries really there good . it got pretty big screw holding battery cover they're there pretty tightly . this makes changing batteries kind chore requires pretty decent screwdriver can't really fly but it also means cover doesn't pop off batteries go flying if you happen drop device . overall very nice product i would reccomend	1

while i love dr. suess his books , i didn't love leap frog version his book . course dr. suess words wonderful i liked how simple page lay outs ( compared some cluttery leap frog books)i not like un needed ugly phrases leap pad people added . ( bumble bee rude cruel ! )even my son said " mom ugly ! " some phrases . voices some characters sound almost sinister . maybe " goth kids " grew up got jobs leap frog , but i remember dr. suess he funny quirky not creepy . sorry leap frog guys , i feel you missed point , tone dr. suess wonderful books . i feel some phrases this book not age appropriate . i would like see more " innocent " books where they not cynical or cruel each other . ( 3-5 year olds should not forced cynical ! )i guess i am picky , i also don't let my son watch sponge bob , or tom jerry ( too violent ) but if you not picky think sponge bob great , then you probly like this book . every mom different ...	1
my son ( 3.5 yo ) loves * everything * thomas lego percy no exception . he plays him almost daily even though he certainly other thomas friends options . part attraction he gets build things ( using his own imagination ) his mega-bloks legos work percy ( duplo size ) . example , this particular set comes special pair blocks pivot . this allowed him build his own `cranky ' water tower , etc . also , he some lego wheeled vehicles ( four wheel 12-up peg size ) percy pull . these he turned into some remarkable `coaches ' . ( really some them huge ! lol)now reviewer pointed out you don't get much track any lego-thomas train kits , but i wouldn't worry it . this actually one thomas toys track doesn't seem important . my son just plays hours floor making things work percy - buildings , coaches , cranky . five stars . great educational toy . lego percy sturdy allows lots creativity . my one suggestion would buy other legos - particularly some wheels bases coaches- if you don't already own some . this way percy his educational best . your child build all sorts friends equipment . note : our lego collection 3099 . i couldn't find it amazon but i think lego duplo 140-pc . bulk tub ( 5352 ) ($15 ) wheeled base vehicles connect percy	1

we just bought this our 3 year old . i not all understand why it labled 5 over !! cute game idea- but this not well put together . first i died when i saw super cheap , barely cardboard gameboard !!!!!!! it very small board , set up like 4 piece puzzle , i predict barely stay together after few plays . jewelery , subpar . crown rings ok , rest very cheap plain . but serves it purpose just fine :) . i give this low marks educational durablity . but jewlery box spinner nice durable !! if they put same effort into whole game it may worth buying . my daughter enjoy dressing up playing game together so salvaged star game .	1

our almost-4 year old son loves dragons one imaginext dinosaur sets , so we thought we'd really surprise him christmas this year imaginext dragon set . while i'm very happy how happy my son it ( he playing it hours ) i feeling we're going much same boat some other reviewers . pros : - interesting color scheme- good detail most pieces- re-configurable- dragon figure really neat- trap door , rotating floor other moving parts lot fun my son operate- got it sale local toys ' us 11 dollars less than listed web site . cons- directions picture-only , much too small see fine detail . - pieces not packaged together logically , so elements set all one bag . you open every bag lay pieces out order able find everything even then there some question whether you've got right part turned right way , per above comment directions . - whole thing comes tumbling down like house cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play . i've put it back together no less than 5 times since i initially put it together this morning . some connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into sockets other pieces , so they tend just slide out instead locking together firmly . i think next year , we'll just stick legos	1
i would give this kit zero stars if i could . instructions say it takes 6-8 weeks seeds sprout . i kept them moist peat warm temperatures over three months after recommended period refrigeration . not single seed sprouted . i finally throw out whole kit when mold took over . complete waste time money . but if you're feeling lucky , you should know most seeds this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads , they all come packaged together same tiny plastic bag . so if you want each type plant growing different section plastic tray provided kit - like shown box cover - you need separate out each seed under strong magnifying glass . even then you won't successful , most these seeds look just like ground pepper . i accidentally spilled few floor , after sweeping them all up i literally couldn't tell them other debris dustpan . way , it takes minimum 6-8 years living ideal growing conditions any plants this kit reach sizes shown box cover . these not plants simply put windowsill . they need environment not easily provided average home - lots very bright light ( 15 hours day ) , lots humidity , acidic growth medium ( such sphagnum moss ) , 80 degrees . even then , these very slow-growing plants . keep humidity level high , you'll need some kind terrarium , preferably covered keep humidity level high . but if you use incandescent bulbs provide necessary level light , amount heat they produce easily raise temperature lethal levels . this reason i recommend combination fluorescent bulbs moist/dry heating pad bottom . sure whatever heating pad you use isn't type shuts off automatically after one hour use . some warnings ... these plants flourish only very limited range environments nourishment . care you would normally give houseplant - all likelihood - kill these plants : never feed them animal protein ( like hamburger ) . fats meat aren't digestible kill them . never use tap water water them . mineral build-up kill them so use distilled water only . never feed them insects killed insecticides , like raid . carnivorous plants should fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs , ants , termites , etc ., rather than hard-shelled insects such beetles . well-stocked pet stores carry dried mealworms , but even these need cut into very small pieces . just baby needs tiny mouthfuls food , so too venus flytraps . never fertilize them . these very slow-growing plants any attempt force them grow kill them .	-1
i purchased this item christmas gift . day after christmas , i helped my son assemble this product . it worked flawlessly first day . next day , i turned it show boys ' grandmother . apparently , steel ball " wheels " under " riders " don't roll very well after initial use . riders would hoisted top , but would fail slide onto one chutes . if they make it onto chute , they would sometimes fail glide all way bottom , or would fall off chute . failure rate went 0% when first used 90% after first day . i've purchased other k'nex items before never problem	-1
i should paid attention reviewer who stated this doll " piece junk " only good thing how doll dressed ! optimistic , after first purchase doll proved disappointing ( she laughs adorably ; she makes sucking noise ; she makes contented sound , which becomes ' stuck ' mechanism her back must turned off ; she not kick her legs ; she not close her eyes when rocked ) i purchased second doll this doll lessfunctional than first one . second doll cries continually . she close her eyes that it ! i returned second one kept first one because she more functional . don't waste your dollars this one	-1

i bought this puzzle my kid after he solved original cube . i read review here other places stating one needed cautious when turning puzzle . however , our major problem it orange stickers ( within ten minutes playing cube ) began peel back fall off . we tried using glue ( they no stick them ) put them back but it not long after green stickers began curling back falling off well . major problem these turned out not " stickers " after all , but rather colored squares vinyl adhereing additional stickers beneath ( all white ) means static . they fall off easily . this nice puzzle show ( impressive desk ) but not actual continued use . hopefully , rubik use proper stickers or adhesive future maybe even tighten up design so this used fun puzzle	1
five kids under age 9 four leapsters house , there rarely time when someone isn't playing one ( if not all ! ) them . we 10 cartridges , this most disappointing ( followed closely spiderman ) . there simply isn't enough them it . beauty leapster ability interact games , learn while they it . watching video 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it .	-1

we finally bought these barbie magic rainbow dolls our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg it repeatedly after each time commercial aired . first , they very excited play them . positives : doll durable . it encourages participants follow instructions . negatives : i notice my daughters wave doll few times before dvd " hears " instructions . positives : dvd provides clear easy understand directions , so your doll programmed your remote control . negatives : doll set off our fire alarm few times before we figured out it doll ( we check see if there really fire ! ) when dvd not , dolls control volume tv ! this very annoying when volume increases just you realize your daughters started playing dolls . my suggestion : de-program doll when your kids finished playing dvd ! or , just keep it deprogrammed use your remote -taking all control away your kids keeping them standing so close tv	1
i misunderstood dimensions listed ( 7.5 1.5 10.5 inches ) thought it would large enough my mother see handle . it isn't . apparently , dimensions include packaging . she loves wheel fortune tv , i thought this game would terrific therapy her hands . very disappointing . i'll returning it , unopened .	1
my five half year old daughter asked this particular barbie doll . she so happy when she opened her present found mermaidia elina doll . she took it out box started play it . soon enough she lost interest however . wings large , so large they actually burden . placing doll inside mermaid tail not easy little hands either . all all , this doll just " make-up " if you see what i mean . pretty but not easy play , easily forgotten . she stand my daiughter room , hasn't touched or played since christmas morning ... not worth price	1

while nothing beats wood blocks ( my opinon ) we these first , they fun ! we like they flexible easy little hands manipulate , not painful if they fall you ! only downside they large , storing them bag like putting together puzzle-they just fit . storing them toy box fills box wasted space ; so we stack them 4 rows beside toy box . it worth hassle if you space them don't mind stacking them up teaching your little one	1
i bought this set my 3.5 year old . we great time putting it together several occasions last couple weeks . once put together , my son imagines adventures it included soldiers . i am not very mechanically inclined but instructions excellent , well-illustrated clear , i no problem them . ( my only quibble orange sticks manual different shade color ones our set , took moment identify . ) first my son just wanted put together foam walls , but second time around he wanted help constructing walls castle . imitating me , he able make duplicate versions some simple structures rather well . he also figured out how make soldiers all himself , their arms , legs , helmets , swords shields . through doing set i also able explain you build foundation first before you put walls floors , third time we made castle , he repeating this point me ! drawbridge really fun well-done . it raises lowers very smoothly . this particular set really only designed make castle , so it not really meant making many different things like other superstruct sets . but this our first one i no regrets . assembly time 30 minutes first time , but after you it once it seems closer 15 minutes . pieces high-quality , fit very well , generally joy handle see . castle looks great once assembled , impress any adults or kids who see it	1

well , i just think little beauty cover easily sells this product . you even imagine her tooting ? she too cute ! slick gentleman blowing whistle like it saxophone he plays be-bop quartet fart blowers makes me wonder if he blowing out both ends . this thing going sound like true life fart ... but without all hassle smell . one warning ... not use this whistle your key chain emergency device . please use real loud whistle . you wouldn't want alone empty parking garage some ghoulish thug chasing you then you just start blowing your fart whistle get someone come your aid . if i heard farts empty parking garage i would most likely run other way . this whistle good times only .	1

i bought this my 2 1/2 year old daughter christmas , she loves it . product i feel designed well , small enough fit her room . previous review stated they difficulty building it , but if you follow directions ( step one shows leave screws loose ) , it goes together easily . my husband i able put this together less than 1/2 hour including trying stop our daughter playing it while it under construction . reviewer voiced disappointment over door fridge not closing completely . ours doesn't close all way , but it stays closed . no little tikes toy i ever purchases latches close doors . sound level great high position , she enjoys comments it makes . i haven't any trouble understanding what voice saying others commented . we're planning buying some additional food sets more play . overall i think this great buy , i feel it keeping my daughter ( i ! ) busy many many hours ahead	1

i-dog so fun use ! all you plug included cable into your digital player headphone port i-dog play your music through tiny internal speaker . i-dog face light up various patterns colored lights depending what type music you play . his tail serves mute button , but careful because he doesn't like you touching too often ! i-dog get sad if you don't give him any music listen . if you don't digital player , you set i-dog your boombox or other music device he " hear " way . there only two reasons why i didn't give i-dog 5 stars : ( 1 ) internal speaker isn't very loud , so you your music player turned up quite high , ( 2 ) battery cover i-dog back leg really hard get off . you definitely need some kind tiny screwdriver get it off	1

buyer beware ! i bought this july 2004 what came newer hasbro version this ( yellow weird-looking thing ) not transparent looking mb original picture . i disappointed first , but after i started playing this newer version while , i began understand why they designed it this way . it little bigger than i'd expected or wanted , but it this size order your hands fit comfortably not cramp . also , center button start game original gone replaced small dot-like start button , which probably placed there case your fingers missed play buttons ( which would cause you screw up game you playing ) . extra 1 inch border may increase size less-than appealing way , but it makes really easy play less cramping . i still think they should've kept old translucent casing , but yellow . i love how there 3 types games 4 levels . original 1-game , 2-3 level ones offer little variety it easy master first couple levels . this one still challenge me . i've only this week now , so i don't know durability yet . it seems well-made	1

considering this game only $20 , it great deal . we so much fun remembering our times arcades we brought this game out small party . guests loved it so much we could barely drag them away . yes , it stick little , but reset works well . if you wear it out , it very cheap replace . you just need remember what it ... very cheap version old arcade games . it won't like nintendo or x-box ! if you treat it well , it last . remember turn off power switch or it eat your batteries . i use rechargeables it even though it says not too it seems work fine . best feature it plugs into front most new tv , so no pulling out tv every time you want plug or unplug it . no messing 3 million cords most us seem behind tv nowadays ! those us who adults now most time , it just stored out site drawer or coffee table when you want look neat tidy . no game cartridges lose or trip over . how could you not just love it ?	1

thing i love pictionary - apart laughing crazy drawings people come up - you don't great artist win . that good me , i tell you ! you see , it not so much how * well * you draw , but more how well you get point across * what * you draw . i've seen people guess right answer some pretty simple line drawings . fact , you'll amazed how some partners seem almost sense what answer . i'm sure most people know how game played , but just case , here gist : there several categories come up randomly you progress around pictionary board . sometimes one person each team draws ( we make this rule apply all time ); otherwise one person draws their partner guesses what their drawing means . first person guess before timer runs out wins round team rolls go again . that basically it anyway . i love this game i highly recommend it good night entertainment friends family	1

i bought this dvd gear walmart $13 , steeply reduced original price . i am watching it while writing this review . lead plummish oldest presenter/ " ballerina " , probably teenager , worst dancer . her ungraceful dancing style little ballet . other little girls just so much better . unfortunately camera not focused them . smelly plastic mat made cheap pvc slippery . bar unsteady . it turned into towel rack our household . whole thing seems awfully amateurly put together . best thing clips various actual ballet performances . you don't want introduce ballet your little ones this dvd . it nothing ballet , let alone swan lake .	-1
this set so delicious you just want eat it ( please don't though ! ) it million one uses fun , fun , fun . you ten pots colorful squishy dough used make dinosaurs , farm animals , people even buildings ! there nothing you make play-doh , my nephew even made plate ham eggs , well that what he said it i am inclined believe him ! all you need plastic sheet , some cookie cutters whole heap imagaination . remember however play-douh goes hard if you don't put it away after you finished using it , make sure lids sealed tightly if you want it last . this great toy children adults enjoy together , this set especially good value it doesn't cost earth it well packaged . well worth investing those long rainy days heading our way	1
this would lot more informative if i actually put ants said ant farm .. o_o anyways i set little thingies up , but there wasnt enough sand all 3 ant farms , red one broke . my opinion : catch your own ants their own dirt	1
i can't even begin explain how wonderful this toy . our 3 year old son completely entertained hours . this sand really mold like clay , but it breaks apart like sand so you reuse it over over . here some recommendations get your money worth out it : 1 . supervise your child while playing this . it great toy enjoy together your children . any parent knows young children left sand , dirt , or any type messy item make great big mess . this no reflection product ; it just what kids like . 2 . put it clean table surface play it . it helps ensure you scoop any sand somehow makes it outiside inflatable walls right back . 3 . buy additional sand packs ensure you plenty sand . while it come enough sand fill all molds , it wouldn't hurt little bit more . all all , i would highly recommend this toy , but only if you don't mind supervising your child while he/she playing it . i can't rave enough this toy	1

if your child likes playing thomas friends trains , harvey brought island sodor because accidents happen . first , big engines teased harvey because his unique look , but harvey soon showed his stuff clearing tracks when percy freight cars derailed way bertie path . after day , nobody ever teased him again . i recommend harvey little bit more than butch , character tow arm , because harvey rails his crane arm more flexible durable . i recommend harvey if you want ready-for-anything crane engine added your collection	1

good collectables , not so good actual toys you play . my daugter broken hook off mater ( bought her new one ) , broken wheel off dynaco mcqueen , broken front axle off tractor . mater tow equipment made softer cheaper plastic than rest toy , i expect new one break any day now . without too sexist , i want point out my 4 year old daughter probably more gentle them than average boy playing them . they never entered sandbox . they not stood , nor thrown , nor monster-trucked bicycle . while i still probably buy more , my daughter loves cars movie wants own them all , ( including frank , which they not make ) i would say all : buyer beware	1
reason why i say it better than step2 deluxe kitchen which we prior this kitchen step2 uses molded plastic which takes away alot space inside make it structurally strong , nothing wrong it glad see our recycled plastic get good use , but wood you get alot more space storing cooking/food accessories same volume . assembly took me 1/2 hour , 10 mins just take out all pieces , unwrapped them placed out floor . if you cordless drill/screwdriver allen or torx bit it save you alot time . i set my torque my drill minimum that all force it needs screw it tightly . careful long bolts , they fairly thin bend very easily . plastic window oven door came broken during shipping lower corner door paint also chipped . i tried call kidkraft phone nearly impossible get anyone you leave voicemail someone call you back ( 3 hrs now no callback ) . i tried their website instead order replacement part which so much easier . bottom line though my 4 1 1/2 yrs old girls love it . my wife saying step2 kitchen sounds working light , just she said my older one made her own sound affects playing microwave buttons . i told her electronic stuff just novelty kids they lose interest it better their imagination anyways without batteries	1

tuesday , i local walmart saw full display new transformers classic line . they bunch both deluxe class ( $9.99 figures include rodimus , starscream , bumblebee astrotrain ) voyager class ( $19.99 figures optimus prime megatron)on saturday night , i bought last 2 deluxe figures they . what i've heard , these figures flying off shelves everywhere . my viewpoint , it good reason . they've brought us classic characters reasonable price all figures i seen so far very well . starscream no exception . if you've only seen this one shelf , it doesn't it true justice . jet mode ( which how it packaged ) okay , but some coloring it bit different what classic transformers fan would used . red blues bit mixed up , but it close enough . robot mode what really makes this figure shine . one look i feeling more than little nostalgic . lot ways . this figure looks much more like cartoon comic character than any figure ever before . poseability very good , only thing it lacks ability bend knees but compare it 1984 version it head shoulders above . transformation also pretty smooth once you get used it . finally , one really nice thing there aren't lot parts lose this one , again especially compared 1984 version . now if you're not old transformers fan , just want cool toy buy your kids , it fits role well , also . fact , it displays very nicely alongside jets cybertron series . plus , i always thought fighter jets made some nicest transformers molds . i've reviewed some other transformers classics line if you'd like take look	1
my inlaws purchased this game , last several times we went down visit them , they kept asking if we wanted play . until last weekend , my answer always " no thanks " . what mistake . i am not dominoes player ( fact i never played ) , but this game became my one my favorites . talk fun , frustrating game . one one tile left ( ok , i called them " chips " ) bam , someone plays wild card , hits button , you sometimes get stuck picking up more tiles than you started game . maybe this typical dominoes , but i can't help believe introduction single , double triple wildfire tiles doesn't add lot excitement game . only thing somewhat annoying honking fire engine after siren when someone hits button ... unless you're one doing it !	1

we played this game all thanksgiving weekend , really enjoyed it . you roll collection dozen or so dice out table , players combine pictures they see dice form words or short phrases . more creative you allow people what pictures represent , more fun it . fast play mode , you snatch up dice you form phrases , slow play , you study dice write down many combinations possible before time up . it actually hurts your mind you study pictures try quickly spot combinations like : " treehouse " " playtime " " car-pet " " laughing gas " " cross-dress " or " long-winded " . i found it great creative exercise may even use it next time i need get group into " brain-storm " mode . my only beef game once you played it number times you strong advantage because you quickly recognize pictures you pre-formed ideas what combinations might come up . example , grave stone cross pink dress kept coming up , people who played previous round would immediately grab them " cross-dress " . this didn't happen often enough hinder game play , however more dice would nice	1

this very complete package flew right out box ! absolutely no assembly other than flight battery , even came both ac dc charger .. very durable item .. dual blades provide steady hovering flight but strongly suggest simulator or flight time cheaper toy model least hovers , give hint what expect . check your balance holding top blades , must level fly correctly , slide battery forward or back make any correction .. likely not trimmed first outing , note directions drift , land right away not trim during flight , make small settings .. i elected fly toy model blade runner or award winner , developed some hovering skill , little direction w/these cheaper ones but gave some hands flight time prior cx .. first flights short , bunnie hops , near trim it hovered beautifully , rather than inches , better luck couple feet off ground too low tendency fall over , same effect even toy model ... then progress over waist head level .. work one direction only , go slowly don't try all movements once , best feature this one letting go right lever still holding throttle it stops hovers , so if it heads wrong way simply let go right lever .. land quickly if it heads towards any obsticle .. my first flights stunning .. takes awhile learn steering ... least twice it zoomed up too high , so make sure there plenty overhead room , bring it down slowly .. second outing i picking up model accident hit throttle blades top hub broke made contact w/ground , dumb mistake my part , parts arriving any day , $8.99 center inner shaft w/hub less blades .. last need lots room first flights , either inside gym or out-side fine provided open area conditions calm , no wind please first flights , later handle 2 mph without much problem .. early mornings evenings usually best often calm ... read instructions fully watch video .. first time flying model , complete winner , love it so far , just take your time patient ..	1

like its cousin , trouble , game sorry quite simple design . reality , however , it both entertaining surprisingly educational board game . it now comes packaged convenient library case . this makes storage easier , it also makes it easier kids get games out shelf without parent helping . ( why it take so long someone think this ? )the simple rules : up 4 players each begin 4 tokens " start " area . players take turns drawing deck cards moving pieces indicated , trying first get all pieces " home " space . cards offer some nice twists beyond simply moving forward : 1 = move 1 space forward or move piece out start2 = move 2 spaces forward or move piece out start , draw again4 = move backward 4 spaces ( occasionally advantage)5 , 8 , 12 = move forward number spaces7 = move 1 or 2 pieces total 7 spaces forward10 = move forward 10 or backward 111 = move forward 11 or switch one your pieces opponents piece " sorry " = take piece your start replace piece your opponent , send them back start . sure say " sorry ! " way makes it clear you really aren't . that pretty much it . game simple enough most kids who count recognize numbers grasp basics . little parental coaching , younger siblings play near-equal footing their older brothers sisters ( note - older sibs not think this fair ) . however , fun ( teaching ) comes all choices . should player use all 1 2 get all 4 pieces out board , or should he focus getting one piece time safety ? should player switch places opponent piece help herself , even if helps her opponent too ? how should he split up 7 ? working through these possibilities challenge younger players , but worthwhile one . probably biggest lessons sorry teaches , though , sportsmanship , ability dealt setbacks , idea not giving up when things aren't going well ( sorry ultimate " it not over it over " game ) . piece near finish get suddendly sent back start temporarily devastating young child . don't expect them take it well first time it happens . here , parents teach best way deal disappointment their own good example . kids who learn these lessons age 6 board game less likely melt down age 7 soccer or t-ball field . all these reasons , sorry great family game . it fun , but it also educational without ever feeling like lesson . 5 stars .	1
