oh those days , when i college , reading my first issues then subscribing . there great things found its pages , columns brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . great struggle soviet union going into critical stage . it seemed nr so right track . it wonderful read , least 1979 1983 . but then it became while duller . it some periods recrudescence , such under editorship john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i've really discovered late how badly neo-con agenda sort taken over magazine . we've got 50th anniversary issue call midge dector rally country our illegal immoral war iraq . really something happened magazine , sinister force entrenched itself there . what force ? well , go come-and-hear.com you begin learn part picture , especially when you read material elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley they dare speak out , which details israeli lobby domination our congress . nr once courageous conservative magazine , but now it heavily tainted influence terrible thing . wfb should know better , maybe he . if he doesn't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! neo-conned again !, then he should listen tony martin talk given ihr certain group tactics deployed suppress free speech . what inspired me write this review wfb recent column incarceration david irving . it ends disgusting gloating . wfb fallen into evil trap , so magazine he used run . what happened christian faith people like buckley ? he now seems lost terribly afraid offending supposedly saintly interest group ... you , mr. lowry , come now : read widely deeply don't afraid reading talmud israeli lobby . once you , maybe you'll develop strength think outside box . we're going if we want anything but bleakest future mankind planet .	1
this magazine just dares people pick most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . " town country " extremely old money venture , while it some good useful articles ( lovely advertisements things virtually nobody afford , ) much magazine essentially centered very elitist worldview grows very tiresome rather quickly . " town country " initially recommended me because ostensibly good coverage travel architecture , two areas i great interest . applicable aside , when i read list tips offshoot " town country travel " publication ways ease stress long range flights , i realized there reality check due when one first tips always fly first class , ignoring fact vast majority readers would rather buy car what typical first class ticket europe or asia costs . i mentioned , there some good articles , there occasionally better more useful offshoot publications like " town country travel " eminently more readable ( although they still insist advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes coast , etc . ) i say photography always good , you believe if it appears here it finest most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like seen reading this magazine . despite occasionally worthwhile features , i find " town country " excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding publication focused whatever area interest you , whether it fashion , society , or travel .	1

first off , i usually just stick rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see ad this website this time/warner ( or whatever hell company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start see red . " entertainment weekly " , which once interesting weekly deluge ho-hum everyday life , become just rag crapped out weekly stand newstands week after week prostituting your hard earned cash . back summer 89 , " ew " released after i read few issues , i decided subscribe . i instantly hooked ( new issue would arrive my mailbox saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting latest news reviews movies , music , t.v. , video ( later added mid-90 ) . problem magazine started late 90 . i started notice " ew " would cover big movie or event hadn't yet released then following week bash hell out it , or try get some piece dirt it order generate more sales . i also hate damn lists " ew " comes up . latest entitled " top 100 most memorable movie lines " joke . these lists always annoyed me , because i feel they truly not thought out therefore not thought provoking . other most important thing i noticed absolute lack honest review . case point , few weeks ago i picked up latest issue which movie " catwoman " reviewed ( i wasn't sure if it gleiberman or shwarzbaum critiqued it ) . i first logged onto " rotten tomatoes.com " see what percentile " catwoman " recieved nation critics . out roughly 115 reviews " catwoman " only got 10% good reviews while rest trashed it ( film needs , least , get grade 60 - 65% order place it fresh or good movie ) . makes " catwoman " worst reviewed film , so far , 2004 . yet , " ew " gave film . what erkes me even more " catwoman " released " warner bros . " , same company owns rights " harry potter " films , " lord rings " trilogy , yes , " wb " owns " entertainment weekly " . " warner bros . " trying bribe or threaten its own critics one its most popular lucrative magazine ? i'm not only who seen this developement . people written saying there favoritism among " warner " products reviewed magazine . " ew " , course , hotly denies anything kind thumping there chests standing behind there reviews , possibly fear fired ( they deny also ) . my only question reviewers " entertainment weekly " , " whats it like stand your own pile bull**it ? " or better yet , " what it like stand democratic podium ? "	-1
i subscribed modern bride gift my fiance . aside not receiving our first issue until 3 months after subscription , i only received 3 issues total . months went without anything delivered . while customer service modern bride very accomodating helpful , nothing happens immediately . when planning wedding , each every month precious . especially during initial stages wedding planning . finally gotten this subscription problem under control exhausting . plus , this time most wedding details finalized , magazines i received became useless . if you're under 12 months your wedding date , you should strongly consider if now good time begin subscription modern bride	1

like " where waldo " , it seems every issue must least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this admitedly classic piece furniture , one gets impression there gaggle designers telling their clients , " you one these , they're what ! " most features metropolitan home suffer same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes same dreary interiors obviously foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients designers who know how make easy buck . " modern " equals , course , mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month 1970 florals , faux louis whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through dreck finding something useable your own purposes , it painful look through this magazine . if you really want ideas making your house reflect you , trust yourself what you like , if you like mies van der rohe daybeds , all means get one . just don't plunk one your sun room because you told it trendy . if you like modern style , look up works hans wegner peter hvidt go there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years hard use real families sturdy well . maybe you want house where nobody allowed set foot any rooms amounts bad hodge-podge styles all seem bit busy bumpy . everyone else , think things you'd like see if you walked into room , save your money skip this magazine	-1

laptop mag best described negatively : it not really serious computer magazine . it more or less like consumer guide , which basically paid advertising . this means you can't really trust article here because you don't know if they not written unbiased writers . end , i feel this waste money . besides , you get all info free web , cnet or zdnet , anyway	-1

i read rolling stone music those who make it , not some guilt ridden , agenda blasting editorial team feels their politics ( guilt so much establishment they wish they could hate ) something we should all read nauseum . when they stick music , it good , when they parade their shreiking political views , it boring .	1
i subscriber 15 years still enjoy magazine . no , its not best magazine music , but it one best general pop culture news i still occassionally find new artists because magazine , though i tend find more new movies now . however , if you ever problem customer service , forget it . i never got my copy 1,000 issue , when i asked replacement , i told they out issue , but would extend my subscription one issue . i pointed out it double issue they still selling back issues their web site $20 . if they don't resolve it quick , i might just cancel my subscription , i'm so disgusted .	-1
our library just finished its magazine usage count , my surprise american spectator came dribbling only couple hits , measured current copies left table check outs older issues . yet our patronage here very conservative . perhaps people who once read this sort thing no longer read all , or maybe , couple reviewers suggested , bill clinton out office , it no longer same appeal . you change my rating five stars if you like , sake ideology , but you still won't read thing . just like i don't read nation anymore	-1
i've loyal subscriber since 1998 always enjoyed magazine . something happened them early 2006 - they've either bought or hired new editor / staff or something . this magazine absolutely terrible now . all ads , fewer fewer pictures babes each issue , hilarious articles now long gone . my last two issues ( sept oct ) trash within minutes pulling them my mailbox . i'm canceling my subscription .	-1

nice cover pictures headlines , but way too many ads . there reason its only twelve bucks , this ad-sponsored mag	1
this definitely magazine gearheads . it pretty much just equipment reviews advertisements . i would given it higher rating but two things : 1 ) i don't think i've ever seen popular photography not love any piece equipment . reviews still useful if you're just wondering what features new gizmo , but still , they ought bit more critical if they're going such review based magazine . 2 ) many ads vendors bad reputations . i believe they make some sort claim requiring certain level honesty anyone they sell ad space , but it sure doesn't look like they ever kicked anyone out magazine me . so what you when you magazine full uncritical reviews , occasional beginnerish article technique , lot ads stores dubious virtue ? best 2 star magazine	1

legend goes there time few decades ago when " gramophone " unquestioned authority reviews recordings classical music . whether or not legend true ( i'm too young know ) , gramophone time definitely passed . today there multitude sources free information classical music internet , newsgroups websites . some it less well-informed than gramophone criticism , but some it more well-informed . what undeniable , price few mouse-clicks , it possible find far greater range reviews recordings internet than gramophone ( its british-based critics ) offer . what more , gramophone tied business-model classical music industry fast becoming obsolete . historically , most important classical recordings issued few so-called " major " companies such emi , deutsche grammophon cbs ( later sony ) . these " majors " would buy lavish advertising spreads gramophone so finance magazine . return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews majors ' new releases would produce pages fluffy interviews musicians under contract majors . today situation different . most interesting new release more likely appear mp3 obscure russian website than new cd sony . small companies , dedicated solely classical music recordings , produce great results shoestring budgets while " major " corporations virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems gramophone business model . new players classical music industry don't publicity budgets fund glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . gramophone implicit bargain : " advertise us or we won't review your recordings " , magazine seems becoming more more irrelevant . if you want subscribe classical music periodical , i recommend " international record review " or " fanfare " . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most all , i suggest checking out huge range classical music information available free web usenet	1

i charter subscriber this magazine when it started up publication . it breath fresh air stagnant field almost universally wretched photography magazines . over years things changed . columnists died or moved . editorial directions switched . articles once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant marketplace , " outdoor photographer " vanguard , pushing every gadget photoshop manipulation plug-in popped up . magazine became wasteland promises better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill blank whatever current trend might ) . what i thought ironic time best photographs they printed photographers using least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film (!?) , lot large format guys , occasionally some black white stuff made cameras just any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began dwindle occasional rare almost non-existent . some point , my interest this garbage lapsed before my subscription . magazine made once monthly trip mailbox trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . " outdoor photographer " impresses people who measure quality photography whether or not equipment used production cost equivalent gross national product small third world countries . it offers little way nutrition hungry mind . it empty calories , just making you want more more while starving your potential . it truly wretched .	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	1

i began subscribing gourmet 1961 , continued subscribe forty years . i also gifted family members subscriprions . i discontinued my subscription because magazine deteriorated so much last several years : there so many ads tear-outs magazine one hardly find recipes , least half magazine , sometimes more ; also i object " political , " some downright offensive , articles . i am catholic , i very offended outrageous article charging , during nazi era , naked jews made crawl through streets their knees persons , which article linked some way catholic church . i think information apochryphal ; , what this food ?	-1
today i purchased my first probably last issue gourmet . while there plenty recipes ( some which i won't use but they still cool look ) there tons ads . it makes you wonder either ) how much people who make this magazine get paid or ) all ads why this isn't free . i see need few ads so we consumers don't pay fortune good magazine . but i took out 33 pages ads figured there 140 full page ads . that over half magazine which 260 pages . that really sad . recipe wise , some them look interesting very gourmet , but there things you need i can't get middle u.s. three six articles interesting read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora ads . fine cooking still best one out there	-1

back 1970 my grandmother subscribed prevention . time , it wonderful magazine , filled informative articles aimed " prevention " illness promotion wellness ( founder prevention , j.i. rodale preached ) . articles role vitamins nutrition light years ahead their time . ( j.i. given lot credit bringing vitamins supplements mainstream ) . over years , especially after tragic death robert rodale ( . i . ' son ) , takeover his wife daughter , it unfortunately transformed into fluffy , tabloid-like " women magazine " scantily clad women covers , one- or two-page articles instructing women get killer abs burn fat . i think j.i. rodale probably spinning his grave see what his descendents butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever what it used . i flipped through copy disgust recently note , reviewer stated , plenty ads drugs which really seems go against idea preventing illness first place ( whereas old prevention sang praises vitamins health foods ) . i don't know why rodale family doesn't just scrap title call it something else , but alas , they major corporation now i little hope this magazine improve any time soon	-1
friend once said me , " if you want glossy no brainer then get vogue ! " how right she , despite glorious photography , fashion models daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't able see them occasional good article it , i admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants voice fashion , voice high brow media but its clientele likes you me , ordinary people who can't afford live high life they portraying its gloss filled pages . personally i'd rather spend my money movie ticket , i get see good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i don't know substence abuse emotional demons haunt particular actor life , i'm just interested enjoying myself couple hours before i go back my hard working life real world . vogue trying sell me dream i don't really want buy into , never penchant selling my soul devil , it gets two stars though because photography really superb , shame rest it though	1
i would like classify myself moderate but i probably lean conservative . because , i subscribed harpers so i could read good writing would challenge my beliefs stretch my mind new ways . i got , more or less , first , but over course couple years magazine drifted further further leftist propaganda screed , worst which louis lapham bitter drivel editorials . it got point where writing incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left pelosi ) writer -- any writer harpers -- would take whatever issue , i pretty good idea what line whining would . if you attend dinner parties upper east side ; if you drive prius oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming environmental travesty ; if you've ever desecrated starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine you . however , if you're dumbfounded how republicans keep winning elections -- then you realize they democratic party opponents ; if you realize genius george bush karl rove getting liberals underestimate george bush karl rove ; if you want read smart , insightful writing inform entertain , then try atlantic monthly ( which , way , i am surprised see reviewers describe liberal magazine ; i think it moderate , if anything , bit conservative side . ) needless say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , harper index -- however , wasn't worth price subscription ( it got only thing worth anything price subscription ) .	1

this magazine reads like inflight magazine : something airlines , careful not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out lull their readers sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . don't you wish someone out there would publish really good magazine books ? one featured meaty stories well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ain't it . it dull bland . occasionally it offers up conservative book review neocon writer catherine seipp , who enlightening bill o'reilly ( , entertaining offensive laughably stupid ) so this sometimes cut dull . but someone here said bland i agree . avoid this one if you iq above 90 . pick up new yorker , atlantic monthly or harper if you like read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries other badly written pieces fluff -- which all this magazine covers -- this might just thing you . i want my money back	-1

i agree those who didn't care it . only thing i liked one article written dad who skateboarding his son . it witty , insightful inspirational . rest mag just seemed totally irrelevent my life . it aimed people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . anyone ? i don't want my kids concerned clothes money . few issues i read made me mad depressed . i've never written review before but felt compelled so regarding this lame magazine . give me break $400 cashmere hoodie my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts what matters . he not reflection my style , he reflection his own . get over yourselves	1
i suscribed this magazine since i got great offer it company i get my other suscriptions so i decided , why not ?? its year , although previews each week prime-time programs fun ( 2 pages worth ) i very dissapointed . articles empty , boring some downright retarded ; rehashing show dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its mistery me how this magazine still around . i realize this entertainment magazine , but still , articles people magazine seem like rocket science comparison - gasp !!! yourself favor just buy tv guide - much more interestin	1
i've subscriber this over 10 years i've loved getting this , but it undergone changes recently not better . specifically , i hate what they've graphical design inside . whereas they used employ several different styles when it came things like fonts artwork whatever subject written , now they've adopted uniform style where nearly everything looks same . it looked better before . writing isn't witty or sharp ( longtime staff departed ? ) , there " filler " pieces form moronic sidebars boxes - useless attempts humor simply don't work . strength magazine continues come critics , especially movie dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going consider letting my sub expire ' cos i don't let my mailbox fill crap like this	1

don't purchase subscriptions amazon or magazine express . following my experiences subscription hiragana times amazon . what this page doesn't tell you japanese magazines subscribed amazon filled company called magazine express shipped seamail japan which mean you'll recieve every issue 8 10 after it released . i placed my order january , date , not recieved single issue . after several phone calls , magazine express people ( who fill amazon subscriptions ) said they restart my subscription may issues which take 8-10 weeks due shipping issues . so after ordering january , i not receive single issue this uncancelable magazine until possibly late july . very poor service . this unacceptable magazine most us japanese bookstores ( fujisan one ) get within week or you order directly publisher only few dollars more . if i known shipping policy i would not ordered magazine supplier , magazine express not cancel subscrition . i advise avoiding all amazon magazine subsriptions due their poorly stated policies . ** update , i wrote this review june . it now july 8th i've just informed i must wait until august 15th see if issue arrives . i ordered magazine january 9th i no resolution either magazine express or amazon who provides no way contact anyone within amazon magazine orders . i reiterate , buying magazines amazon if poor idea	-1
well , imagine my surprise when i picked up february 2004 issue , found things drastically changed . mainly editor letter . it used 1 page , now it just small little column now , exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now redesign isnt bad other zd game mags , but removal 1 page editor letter , really steams me up . least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey scorched earth column . it still 1 page . it last page usually . yes redesign really bad terms readability . most time they red or blue or yellow background , it really hard read text times . now least their disc auto-load , unlike pc gamer . what really pisses me off , when magazine hot 100 section , or best pc or videocards , or peripherals section , they hardly ever change captions or descriptions come it . i'm sorry if i got off track lot , but i felt need . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor editor-in-chief re-assigned become editor-in-chief official xbox magazine . new eic pcg former executive editor , i hate him , so this why i say cgw now best pc games magazine	1
i got this magazine year half before i quit my subscription recently . i liked all fashion tips articles how dress your body size style , why i subscribed begin . but i not expecting bombardment amoral opinions forced me . ( not mention overload advertising- which you get most fashion magazines anyway , so that not complaint ) . sure there few lines here there nonbiased ( telling facts stds such ) , but 90% articles sex , opinion not fact . girls today sex anyone getting hurt emotionally physically because magazines like seventeen who say sex good if you're ready ( what 15 year old girl ready sex get std or baby ?? please . ) , condoms 100% effective . they not , but that what most teen girls believe because stupid magazines like this . they need take advice their parents doctors , not magazine articles . i disgusted opinions presented truth basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .	1
admittedly , i am slightly older than " relevant " demographic . but i'm not 40 yet ! so there number things here some appeal me . i applaud magazine attempting address culturally important issues . still , magazine suffers it unrelenting fawning over whole post-modern vibe it own sense self-importance beacon charismatic hipness . ( " hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks ipods too ! " ) usually , more something or someone sweats proclaim their own relevance , more danger there they become irrelevant . so , like it spiritual cousin " charisma , " this magazine suffers somewhat shallow perspective life culture . it trumpets its ability ask " tough questions , " even it follows relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea cutting edge put bono cover . if you want cutting edge , put libertine adam clayton cover ask him bono faith . now , i would read article ! ( i am major u2 bono fan . i'm not knocking him ; just lack imagination " relevant " . ) there also way too much emulation world perspective generational heritage . " hey , we're young , we're smart , we don't need anything way our geezer parents it . " i guess little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it today paris hilton culture , but i'd like think it might little different culture shaped biblical values . actually , " relevant " seems little afraid say what " biblical values " ( beyond obvious politically expedient ones ); it all seems amorphous here . i've never fan whole " what hot/what not " ethos . , i'd like give little more respect today christian young people think they could handle something didn't fall into same faddish trap . i am hopeful they may get it right yet " relevant " . times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization youth , culture icon quotations , psycobabble " cool dude " theological lingo make one relevant	1
first off , i subscribed this magazine couple years , enjoyed it . but " main guy " robert kennedy , someone who offends me both personally politically . he assumes every girl/women reading magazine tiny . his information , some us work out 5-6 days week eat well , still heavy-set . his comments heavy-set people offensive , thoughtless , sometimes even downright cruel . nonetheless , pictures/articles inspiring me , it decent fitness magazine	1

i used enjoyed discover , but past several months their radicals changes , got me think real dumbing down . once awhile , they would put together good article - but not constantly . how we enlighten ourselves improve our intelligence science etc world stage . there still many us not want glued computer science we would tv . discover editorial staff ought get their magazine back track or circulation subscriber base going go down tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky telescope , science news havent fallen down . i am not renewing my subscription unless discover ' rediscovers ' itself . how dumb americans !	1
i am also longtime subscriber , i am quite outraged new changes made magazine . i written letter editor containing my list grievances , if you ( i would hope they would redressed but they probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am current subscriber , quite suprised discover new look ( all reading this review amazon.com: amazon.com not display updated version what discover currently looks like ) . i didn't quite care it , but long material stayed same i going allright it . unfortunately , articles discover degenerated into " top 20 things you didn't know ... " lists , piles trivia , some sexual humor editorializing recent news . sure , reading gay astronauts may little humorous . it appropriate what discover stood or what i expected this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there intelligent article . cover story still seems up par stories old discover . i really once enjoy this magazine it most expected item arrive my mailbox . i've kept all my copies last five years best condition i possibly could because i truly enjoy reading them , still . maybe this new discover " new generation " or meant lure younger or less mature readers , but i think change articles taken turn worse . i think ordinary person , " lay man " if you , would appreciate least intelligent articles new , interesting groundbreaking discoveries scientific community . i remember string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) one most well-written articles topic . it very exciting , most importantly it [ i]got me interested science[/i ] . i doubt i ever see anything good discover magazine again . i'd really hate give up this magazine : all i ask old discover back .	1

i echo same gripe other reviewers voiced here : magazine covers same handful people week after week after boring week . how many times reader going see no talents such jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , tom cruise-katie holmes joke , most overrated , overhyped people all time brad pitt angelina jolie cover not get tired it ? it nice know what going certain celebrities once while but every single week ? you say " overkill ? " i'm glad i never got subscription this magazine . i picked it up every once while newsstand but stopped because i so sick tired reading overrated , overhyped glorified b-movie " actors " " actresses " who lucky one successful movie haven't anything value since . i picked up copy today sworn it off forever . don't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom	1
this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1
i ordered journal year ago received 2 issues , never received issue . i contacted customer service problem , used problem report forms(or whatever it called ) never heard them again . i get this email today telling me renew my subscription ...

if you're teenage guitarist want learn nickelback , green day , nu-metal songs , then this magazine you . there also some pretty good tips beginners time time . but last several years quality feature articles interviews gone steadily downhill , there far too many ads . many people said , sometimes it doesn't seem geared towards musicians all anymore . smarmy , " hipper than thou " rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style writing seems taking over mag . other styles music such blues , country , jazz , etc , pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you're teenager you see it newsstand there song it you would like learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine	1

you tell title , i'm not enamored this magazine . i've playing video games since early 80s , read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons this negative review gamepro follow no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites 1-10 system decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) written part reviews way too short , often written borderline incoherantly . it if they hired proverbial 1,000 monkeys type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews one page . screen shots provided reviews often size postage stamp . 4 . ) number ads relation content distinctly high . once when i bored , i counted all ads one issue . out around 110 pages there 60+ pages ads . 5 . ) their article layouts confusing , occasionally they print colored backgrounds closely match text color . forget reading it if you're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips either so obvious brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain don't work . i suspect ones ripped off various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs same better gaming mags , such egm game informer . so , closing ... if you want good gaming magazine , just any magazine other than gamepro would improvement . many great gaming magazines come gone , why turd like gamepro continues mystery me	-1

i'de never read vibe first place , but i won free years subscription some online contest . i must also mention i'm huge fan hip-hop hip-hop culture , so i'de think vibe would tight ..... daamn , i ever wrong . first off , half mag advertising .... then what little reading there .... it all bullsh ** . interviews they artists totally weak watered down . they never ask any worthwhile questions . vibe also contradicts itself constantly . one issue , they'll give album low rating poor review , then end year they name same album one years best .... what f*** ? vibe it decent moments , but i def . won't paying it anytime soon .	1
where critiques ? articles lack any critical substance . whoever hot moment get their behind kissed . it doesn't matter album usually not worth all hype , vibe go flow . top , there more ads now than ever before . even articles could decent cut down page or so sake saving advertising space .	1

first off , i usually just stick rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see ad this website this time/warner ( or whatever hell company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start see red . " entertainment weekly " , which once interesting weekly deluge ho-hum everyday life , become just rag crapped out weekly stand newstands week after week prostituting your hard earned cash . back summer 89 , " ew " released after i read few issues , i decided subscribe . i instantly hooked ( new issue would arrive my mailbox saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting latest news reviews movies , music , t.v. , video ( later added mid-90 ) . problem magazine started late 90 . i started notice " ew " would cover big movie or event hadn't yet released then following week bash hell out it , or try get some piece dirt it order generate more sales . i also hate damn lists " ew " comes up . latest entitled " top 100 most memorable movie lines " joke . these lists always annoyed me , because i feel they truly not thought out therefore not thought provoking . other most important thing i noticed absolute lack honest review . case point , few weeks ago i picked up latest issue which movie " catwoman " reviewed ( i wasn't sure if it gleiberman or shwarzbaum critiqued it ) . i first logged onto " rotten tomatoes.com " see what percentile " catwoman " recieved nation critics . out roughly 115 reviews " catwoman " only got 10% good reviews while rest trashed it ( film needs , least , get grade 60 - 65% order place it fresh or good movie ) . makes " catwoman " worst reviewed film , so far , 2004 . yet , " ew " gave film . what erkes me even more " catwoman " released " warner bros . " , same company owns rights " harry potter " films , " lord rings " trilogy , yes , " wb " owns " entertainment weekly " . " warner bros . " trying bribe or threaten its own critics one its most popular lucrative magazine ? i'm not only who seen this developement . people written saying there favoritism among " warner " products reviewed magazine . " ew " , course , hotly denies anything kind thumping there chests standing behind there reviews , possibly fear fired ( they deny also ) . my only question reviewers " entertainment weekly " , " whats it like stand your own pile bull**it ? " or better yet , " what it like stand democratic podium ? "	-1
this one many magazines float around school library , it most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all it pure celebrity gossip . there really nothing else here . if you like blurry photos lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul like , ( blurry so you can't see zits flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it coming back . she wearing baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts common among women wanting hide gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far i tell ) . if you want read fact nichole richie acquired yet chloe paddington , fact donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now he gotten her knocked up , or you would like see photos victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine full lies well-for instance , one writer claims young people like lindsay lohan get higher car insurance rates accidents they not fault . false ! you only get higher rates if you fault . this magazine nothing more than overpriced tabloid . there nothing value here . half time insider some anonymous friend , half time facts aren't right . avoid this thing all costs , unless course you celebrity worshipper . i've got better things than worship people who too much money their own good . i'll stick more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch	-1

this great magazine , but don't order it through amazon . they go through third party ( snapse magazine)that terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine january six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice told they no record order ( even though i received email confirmation amazon i 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it get back me . no one called or emailed me status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted if i just placed order told me it takes 6 8 weeks receive first issue . i won't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .	-1
i am time person year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say reading time magazine like reading platform democratic party . actually it even worse than it like reading john dean diary , filled more fantasy personal wishes than actual reality . one latest online edition realists taken over washington . give me break . new set hogs come take over troff it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi her gang political hacks going help america fool . best thing we hope they create so much gridlock no one spend any money washington . maybe then they see america improves its own politicians both side make things awful . sad thing people read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something world . this publication so biased it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try repeat what they " learned " . if you want truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe economist . it probably not change your political affiliations but it least make you sound competent when you debate others . economist quite simply best weekly news magazine existence . articles well written people know what they talking . leaders around world read contribute economist . this something time , newsweek rest their ilk cannot claim . i am not affiliated any political parties not consider myself political . i look things economic perspective vote accordingly	-1

i like read cook illustrated library . their magazine much too expensive small amount recipes included within . i like tips sent readers , some product reviews . i found most their recipes very involved -- nitpicky , kind . lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried their " america test kitchen " cookbook -- calls cooking cornstarch water , cooling it , then beating solution into meringue . supposedly this keeps meringue destabilizing . all happened my kitchen i found little lumps cornstarch glue bottom my mixing bowl while scraping out meringue . i made meringue before without cornstarch , can't help thinking this extra step isn't neccessary . their " best " brownies good , but i make equally good brownies without all extra steps involved melting chocolate cooling it , etc . if you're looking easy , fool proof recipes , don't take gazillion steps aren't fussy exactly what ingredients you use , this isn't magazine you	1
cook illustrated first cooking magazine i'd found myself truly motivated read cover-to-cover , even though they insert advertisements their own products , which i suppose , them , makes this " ad-free " magazine , but i'm not surprised they've bent rules claim . one time i found it necessary contact cook illustrated customer service issue , i simply floored treatment i received ... i'll simply leave it . i personally don't intend re-subscribing ( " fine cooking " , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find this cooking magazine you . , far what they goes , cook illustrated good what they - i'll give them . if you not found this review helpful , i'm sorry if i haven't made value my warning apparent . just know there those us out there who bad experiences , simply trying prevent others experiencing same .	1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1

oh those days , when i college , reading my first issues then subscribing . there great things found its pages , columns brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . great struggle soviet union going into critical stage . it seemed nr so right track . it wonderful read , least 1979 1983 . but then it became while duller . it some periods recrudescence , such under editorship john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i've really discovered late how badly neo-con agenda sort taken over magazine . we've got 50th anniversary issue call midge dector rally country our illegal immoral war iraq . really something happened magazine , sinister force entrenched itself there . what force ? well , go come-and-hear.com you begin learn part picture , especially when you read material elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley they dare speak out , which details israeli lobby domination our congress . nr once courageous conservative magazine , but now it heavily tainted influence terrible thing . wfb should know better , maybe he . if he doesn't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! neo-conned again !, then he should listen tony martin talk given ihr certain group tactics deployed suppress free speech . what inspired me write this review wfb recent column incarceration david irving . it ends disgusting gloating . wfb fallen into evil trap , so magazine he used run . what happened christian faith people like buckley ? he now seems lost terribly afraid offending supposedly saintly interest group ... you , mr. lowry , come now : read widely deeply don't afraid reading talmud israeli lobby . once you , maybe you'll develop strength think outside box . we're going if we want anything but bleakest future mankind planet .	1

legend goes there time few decades ago when " gramophone " unquestioned authority reviews recordings classical music . whether or not legend true ( i'm too young know ) , gramophone time definitely passed . today there multitude sources free information classical music internet , newsgroups websites . some it less well-informed than gramophone criticism , but some it more well-informed . what undeniable , price few mouse-clicks , it possible find far greater range reviews recordings internet than gramophone ( its british-based critics ) offer . what more , gramophone tied business-model classical music industry fast becoming obsolete . historically , most important classical recordings issued few so-called " major " companies such emi , deutsche grammophon cbs ( later sony ) . these " majors " would buy lavish advertising spreads gramophone so finance magazine . return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews majors ' new releases would produce pages fluffy interviews musicians under contract majors . today situation different . most interesting new release more likely appear mp3 obscure russian website than new cd sony . small companies , dedicated solely classical music recordings , produce great results shoestring budgets while " major " corporations virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems gramophone business model . new players classical music industry don't publicity budgets fund glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . gramophone implicit bargain : " advertise us or we won't review your recordings " , magazine seems becoming more more irrelevant . if you want subscribe classical music periodical , i recommend " international record review " or " fanfare " . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most all , i suggest checking out huge range classical music information available free web usenet	1

my family received this magazine years , but recently we decided not re-new our subscription . this used quality product but it recently gone downhill inclusion more more advertising each issue . this point , nearly half magazine consists advertisements -- this isn't real science magazine it claims , waste money . content not all great . articles often extremely short , too short even pre-teen audience . my kids often wished this magazine included more serious science topics , not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much magazine full " fluff " -- things like word searches picture matching games , which didn't interest my children . content might okay 7-8 year olds children slightly lower reading levels , but older children bored . all all , i'd recommend you simply get regular , adult version national geographic . though articles might too complex children , pictures make up what they can't read . if you're looking more children's-oriented magazine , you're better off muse , high quality general science magazine published smithsonian museum washington , dc . however , muse caters slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 up .	1

i found this magazine helpful introduction advanced computing . that it . this mag seems biased towards certain products amp ; manufacturers . they neglected open my eyes wider . reviews/articles published seem favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they don't give credit smaller , better , less-well-known companies technologies . all info pretty basic intro users , but if that what you interested ... then this great non-comlicated publication	1
thing i hate this magazine letters editor section . supposedly , they're written real people . but after reading this magazine last few years , these letters all seem same maudlin , soporific , sappy style prose reads me like they've edited way . there this condescending " athletes supposed behave like good ladies gentlemen if they don't , then tsk tsk - what children think ?

i would like classify myself moderate but i probably lean conservative . because , i subscribed harpers so i could read good writing would challenge my beliefs stretch my mind new ways . i got , more or less , first , but over course couple years magazine drifted further further leftist propaganda screed , worst which louis lapham bitter drivel editorials . it got point where writing incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left pelosi ) writer -- any writer harpers -- would take whatever issue , i pretty good idea what line whining would . if you attend dinner parties upper east side ; if you drive prius oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming environmental travesty ; if you've ever desecrated starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine you . however , if you're dumbfounded how republicans keep winning elections -- then you realize they democratic party opponents ; if you realize genius george bush karl rove getting liberals underestimate george bush karl rove ; if you want read smart , insightful writing inform entertain , then try atlantic monthly ( which , way , i am surprised see reviewers describe liberal magazine ; i think it moderate , if anything , bit conservative side . ) needless say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , harper index -- however , wasn't worth price subscription ( it got only thing worth anything price subscription ) .	1

i've watching this magazine slide downhill some time , but they've finally hit bottom . bulk april 25 2006 magazine devoted cars . yes , todays automobiles becoming highly computerized , but magazine supposed highlight software hardware we use our desktops . pc mag drifting far afield , doing articles apple computers , gaming systems , extensive reviews cameras . instead pcs , subject seems anything computer chip it , or some way remotely related computers . obvious inference there nothing interesting going pc world , so they keep stretching just fill pages . i find hard believe ; i think it more likely staff lost their focus , or they've hired people who not interested or qualified write pcs . lack pertinent content makes dwindling size magazine even more apparent . what used rival small phone book now size time magazine . they now " new look " , it awful . their readership used consist well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people don't need dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , cutesy " handwritten " notes belaboring obvious . that more appropriate folks who hard time getting through high school short attention spans . compare this issue issues couple years ago , it obvious they've " dumbed down " entire magazine . i've subscribed pc magazine years , considered it " must read " keep up rapidly evolving hardware software pc world . but no more -- it time find one something useful write subject personal computers .	-1
you tell title , i'm not enamored this magazine . i've playing video games since early 80s , read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons this negative review gamepro follow no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites 1-10 system decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) written part reviews way too short , often written borderline incoherantly . it if they hired proverbial 1,000 monkeys type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews one page . screen shots provided reviews often size postage stamp . 4 . ) number ads relation content distinctly high . once when i bored , i counted all ads one issue . out around 110 pages there 60+ pages ads . 5 . ) their article layouts confusing , occasionally they print colored backgrounds closely match text color . forget reading it if you're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips either so obvious brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain don't work . i suspect ones ripped off various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs same better gaming mags , such egm game informer . so , closing ... if you want good gaming magazine , just any magazine other than gamepro would improvement . many great gaming magazines come gone , why turd like gamepro continues mystery me	-1

i decided i write review newsweek this morning , after i came across yet biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one entitled , " rethinking marriage crunch , " goes back everything they presented 20 years ago woman chances getting married later life . this undoubtedly very easy them they probably no evidence their assertion first time around , neglected any this occasion . i really think reviewer comparison people quite apt , but newsweek also provides reliably pro-sexual revolution pro-sixties counter-culture take almost every issue . two years ago , we made privy bit front page sensationalism concerning " infidelity chic . " yes , it seems , according their sources , spousal cheating all rage even though they argue , without even hint contradiction , everybody still wants get married much ever before . i find magazine [ ... ] they offer opinion instead news ; theirs mission persuasion . overall , there little which recommend this publication it geared readership trivial people who possess depth kiddy pool .	1
psychology today purports deliver latest trends psychological studies layman , but what it really delivers pop psychology whole lot advertisements . i give magazine one star very snazzy layout , second star hiring writers don't insult reader intelligence abusing alliteration ( unlike magazine supposedly aimed intelligent adults ) . however , content consistently concerned more pop culture than lives real people . i also noticed bias against introverts article after article attacks shyness serious character defect , rather than simply personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want avoid yet lecture how your way relating world intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )	1
this definitely inferior rag big trio science monthlies . filled poorly-written articles . i actually went back home depot once get refund this magazine . it indeed worth gas time get refund if you actually pay this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , no i'm not talking advertisements , but actual articles themselves . magazine not news magazine , it just one big advertising rag where manufacturers paid get . if you like paying ads , go it	1
i'm sure this review isn't unique . spin rotates same ten bands its cover , not mention ridiculous articles written within . time they get describing ' euro-punk-indie-pop artist just slammed them face their way train station their jazzed up sound ' i've completely forgotten point thier article . they must greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they tag onto useless music still manage say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need get out little more stop getting thier info mtv.com . i'm sure i've learned more what thier editors office any given day than anything remotely close music while reading spin . next time you see it stands , i suggest you spin direction	-1
why ? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it nothing natural health . it advertisements . it empty , completelly . more : it looks like woman magazine but i believe clever woman would feel like i feel now , angry ! i paid something i believed but it not . ok , we make mistakes	-1
nice cover pictures headlines , but way too many ads . there reason its only twelve bucks , this ad-sponsored mag	1
this definitely magazine gearheads . it pretty much just equipment reviews advertisements . i would given it higher rating but two things : 1 ) i don't think i've ever seen popular photography not love any piece equipment . reviews still useful if you're just wondering what features new gizmo , but still , they ought bit more critical if they're going such review based magazine . 2 ) many ads vendors bad reputations . i believe they make some sort claim requiring certain level honesty anyone they sell ad space , but it sure doesn't look like they ever kicked anyone out magazine me . so what you when you magazine full uncritical reviews , occasional beginnerish article technique , lot ads stores dubious virtue ? best 2 star magazine	1

i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	1
i subscribed bhg their website ended up subscribing additional year . articles helpful degree but layout this magazine , its overwhelming amount advertising , takes away any good points . i've found style choppy very difficult read because ads . it hard tell how long article or where it starts . i rarely find anything i'd want save . overall disappointment	1
i started reciving vibe magazine mail announced unexpected . this wouldn't first time this happened , turns out my grandmother bought me people magazine gift copies sent my house . i figured somebody got me this magazine gift . next thing i know charge magazine appears my bank statement . i called vibe immediately asked them what happened . they told me there nothing they could their company didn't directly deal payment issues subscription services . they gave me toll free number i too call outside company handled payments . when i called this company , it completely automated service , could not speak actual person regardless what extension i used . i eventually go down my bank find out what i could . turns out vibe illegally gained my bank account number charging me months , but i only just recently started recieve magazine . i close down my checking account open up new one , which resulted me charged my gym other other companies access my account order subtract monthly bills . it if i written them bad check , something i never my life now greatly questioned my credibility . please not support these people , they theives top magazine terrible uncredible . i seriously hope my review help deter any all people subscribing this magazine	-1

i reading this magazine work , i consider it trashy magazine . it only focuses sexual part women , like if sex best thing world , because they this article which girl riding taxi , she thought taxi guy fine , so she unbutton her shirt told taxi guy touch her breasts . then she says it * best experience she ever . i just cant believe they publish garbage like , giving message women its ok undress yourself total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer read things focus more inner heart , emotional , spiritual side things . read books help me better person right now future , throw away garbage this society	-1
great magazine but beware subscriptions . my subscription paid back august ' 06 i yet see copy ( january ' 07 ) . their customer service assured me twice they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives . plus , phone number they provided not service ! its shame because magazine looks really well	-1
i subscribed hobby farm after reading two issues i cancelled it . i read article march/april issue show birds . then , i got my may/june issue . don schrider , communication director albc , wrote correct story . article claimed " over 1000 " birds show , correction 11,640 birds present . other correction regarding earlobe color egg shell color stating there exceptions red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs . mar/apr issue i read article guinea hens . may/june issue i read letter reader ( dana manchester member guinea fowl breeders assoc . ) correcting article previous issue . apparently , guineas aren't " watch fowl " they portrayed , but fall victim predation often . dana manchester also corrected mislabeled photos guineas . these may small errors but how goods resource isn't reliable ? if errors only issues , i may given mag 3 stars but article manure management may/june issue lacking many levels . advise nutshell buy manure spreader you pull around your field , fill'er up drive . one word caution according article- only use well rotted manure garden , but there wasn't one word how rot manure . i liked article smaller breeds cattle , " bigger not better " may/june but we'll wait next issue see if any readers step forward corrections . i am not waiting around . there lot books magazines dedicated small farms . i like mother nature news i just subscribed countryside ( my nephew recommended it he owns small farm , well ) . i also like john seymour book self-sufficient life how live it . he upbeat attitude can-do spirit .	1

i , repeat reading this magazine ten years or so . over time they really changed . i guess it started when they got new editor four or five years ago . after adds changed building suppliers lexus ads . i don't like seeing automotive home stereo ads my how-to magazine . information more akin martha stewart than it norm abrams . who way hardly there anymore if all . not mention new guy , stray they picked up ask this old house , what opie taylor he . what makes him eligible write something toh magazine . i really miss steve thomas . how-to though somewhat informative really lack intricate details . all i say thank god tom silva still puts some minutia his wealth information . if you'd like " better homes gardens plus magazine " then this magazines you if you want learn something try fine homebuilding or least family handyman	1

don't get me wrong .. i love two hard cover books , real simple solutions real simple : guide organized living . they gems . however , magazine simply betrays it words . one rater stated , it seems like reader cajoled into buying un-needed expensive products , my god .. magazine cluttered ads inserts , plus it very hard turn pages read . i realize ads necessary , but this extreme , especially magazine supposedly promotes less complicated cluttered life it readers	1
it almost if this magazine writes it stories 2 mounths advance onces you get " latest " copy it news repeated 7961 , 583 times . it however decent posters ( that why it got 2 not just 1 ) but thats only thing this magazine offer .	1
knitters take note : i purchased what titled " anna : burda knitting needlecrafts-english ed " . what arrived " anna needlework crafts , " which contains very little knitting . i should looked photo magazine cover ad , which displays needlework crafts cover . since i can't find magazine conveniently my north mississippi area i'll shell out 50 bucks order publisher , i guess .	-1
after ordering this magazine it sems i've got gardening membership , which okay i guess , but now i've got some book sitting my office i preview 10 days decide keep low low cost only ..... you get picture . all i wanted gardening magazine . if i wanted join book club or gardening club than i would . i really feel like i decieved discription this magazine now i get joyful fun returning items i don't want or getting charged them . yeah !	1
this magazine published same people brought us maxim . so if you like maxim , check it out . if you don't: pass . pictures slick , models attractive , but there little way information how it yourself or what actually bike . it basically picture book . if you looking technical articles , how tos or performance installs ; check out road bike metrics or hot bike or american iron harleys victory 	1

we subscription this magazine it pretty good one kids , albeit woefully thin . i found it too expensive few pages magazine not renew it . after ignoring standard renewal pleas , yesterday i found my mailbox letter ( subscription invoice attached , course ) stating my account " seriously past due " " further action pending " my " delinquent " account . those getting similar notices , i found this number call : 1-800-825-2821the lady i spoke said she cancelled ' unathorized order ' ... we shall see if i receive any other notices . it really shame tactics subscription services overshadow actual product	-1
i am not alone here when i say knit ' style joke most knitters . myself my knitting friends agree it evidence someone , somewhere , seriously deluded if they think these patterns what average knitter yearning make . i can't help but believe if you can't get published worthwhile knitting magazine then you go knit ' style . because , seriously , they'll take anything try sell it poor unsuspecting knitters . save yourself money flip through this magazine if you see it shelf somewhere . you may get lucky find one pattern that worth making single issue ... but then again , you may not . i suggest interweave knits , family circle easy knits , or vogue knitting if you want patterns you'll actually want wear .	-1
i two three years knit style ( 2001 - 2003)magazines , lately spent lot time looking through them cardigan pattern knit myself . i haven't found single one . all patterns serious faults : drop shoulders , ( totally unacceptable ) little or no armhole , neck and/or shoulder shaping . most sleeves little or no cap . , worst all , they all made five or more pieces . haven't any these quot ; designersquot ; heard elizabeth zimmerman ? i going give lot library , but am wondering if perhaps trash might better place . if you trying attract new knitters among younger people , why don't you teach them proper way knit ? young people smarter than you think	-1
we subscribed this magazine , part due special offer 12 free cycling booklets road log each new subscription . what we get ? note letting us know unfortunately " gift described promotion no longer available " " rather than keep us waiting , ( they've ) taken liberty sending enclosed substitute ...

so i'm mostly other folks content . if you get lucky , small sampling product reviews include some item you're looking ( or should ) , anemic review prompt you follow up manufacturers website . " buyer guide " decent breadth useless depth bikes . no bikes gary fisher , inventor mountain biking . huh ? i'm primarily interested mtb issues mountain bike good . but , you only get 4 issues , content redundant two magazines ( or even within each mag ) . instance , may mtb issue story rebuilding trails los alamos ( i actually really like their reviews specific places ) , cover also boasted " great american trail guide . " one four trails talked this " great american .. guide " : los alamos . i spot cut paste job when i see one . also issue " bike started revolution " sp stumpjumper . great idea interesting article butchered into condescending comic strip . also , ordered mag issues mtb , i disappointed when they didn't even show up . emails customer service resulted one more disappointing " you not read my email " type exchanges . two months later , i now one two missing issues hand . they great photography , i yet find better option , but i'm really disappointed . i won't renew	1

unless you want editor liberal political views shoved down your throat , avoid this magazine . it leans left so hard you lie your side even read it . ( no , i am not republican or democrat , but independent who looks all sides ) . editor this magazine huge agenda get democrats back power , he bashes bush republican party over head 10-ton hammer monthly basis , yet worships eco-phonies like laurie david celebrities who want rest us drive eco-friendly cars while they fly world their private jets . ( i understand laurie her friends like sheryl crow " trying " wean themselves off this practice cutting down their private jet hopping trips wee bit using huge gas guzzling bus criss-crossing country instead , but poor laurie finding this hard give up . what hyprocrites these hollywood folks ! ) though i am personally trying my bit environment , i hate when i read issues like current " green " issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us " common people " make changes . this used great fashion , entertainment current event magazine lot in-depth articles , but now it only political platform publication . i now just throw it away soon it arrives when i receive it , until my subscription expires	-1

i paid too much amazon . subscription would significantly less expensive straight magazine . i learned my lesson	1
cooking pleasures magazine magazine produced cooking club america . i very happily joined cooking club america , began receiving this magazine quite while ago . club offers so much its subscribers , but time wore , i could see marketing department tad too aggressive my taste . cooking club america offers their potential members numerous items entice them join . members take part member-only contests where kitchen products gift baskets some prizes . they sent food items or kitchen products review . they also receive cheese grater joining ! there some nice photographs this publication . recipes not complicated either , although they require some unusual ingredients some very expensive many people would find hard locate . i , personally , forego some recipes , others ; i order couple ingredients online , because reasons given . cheese grater sent you nice idea , but it rotary grater , you squeeze very hard get cheese grate . also , grater made plastic eventually snaps half after using it only handful times . club also offers you culinary resource directory . information contained this directory not difficult find basic internet search . you also receive standard sized blank recipe cards . unfortunately , due size recipe cards , i not believe anyone even write ingredients onto them without running out space . also , part member benefits sample products review . potential members see photographs blenders , ice cream makers much more . while member there three years , i opportunity review quick rise yeast chipotle spice . both nice products . they not glamorous photos kitchen appliances , but it something ! currently , they offering visa credit card their logo . this card , not only you use card like any other credit card , but also you receive club discounts . if this something appeals you , see club details . approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription , they start mailing you how you should renew your membership following year now , so you help them keep club costs down . after just paying current year , i not interested paying year already . idea may not contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions . may save club some money . i caller id , i utilize it all time , screening my calls specifically avoid telemarketing calls . imagine my surprise when i pick up call it representative cooking club america . i , actually , pleasantly surprised , thinking i embark benefit member . i most disappointed hear mono-toned voice other end line , reading script , suggesting i become lifetime member now . when i tell them i am not interested , they " new " deal me . when i still tell them i am not interested , they yet deal . calls continued after this conversation couple months . this point , my subscription expired . i relieved telemarketing phone call really turned me off . you should there see me receive my credit card statement . cooking club america automatically charged my credit card my next subscription without my permission . it three months after my original subscription expired ! you imagine , this extremely upsetting . upon doing my research this article , i come find others similar experiences this magazine . it shame too , this magazine plenty potential . unfortunately , their marketing department could utilize different tactics maintaining their current membership . despite this magazine very affordable , i recommend you save your money this one try fine cooking , cuisine home or cook illustrated . not only these magazines provide better recipes , more professional tips , they also not call you daily get your money	-1

i used love light tasty , then they decided change look format , even though reader surveys said keep it same . new look hard read , lacks down-home feel makes magazines popular . there less pictures finished dishes , pictures they show smaller . they added full page ads thier country store products , which goes against no ad promise . i subscribed years , but this new look horrible . get it store see if you like it first	1

what it these gossip magazines ?? please tell me , because i truly think no one their right mind would ever subscribe this garbage . all it mindless crap media puts into kids minds , while not anything important else magazine . unless your 10 years old , not subscribe this . there better magazines out there fortunately , like seventeen cosmogirl ! which aren't nearly filled garbage like this . reason you don't see j-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this top magazine list because it no effect people , it little kids it not mature . period .	-1
i must say i've read just every teen magazine market , this far worst one i've ever read . however , this point my life , everything appears superficial immature . i first picked up twist when it debuted newsstands . i believe august 1997 . i nine then , looking fashion forward among my girlfriends who still into jungle gym . because my insane desire cool , because twist wasn't too hard me understand , i loved it bought it religiously year . my obsession it slowly faded magazine got progressively worse i didn't pick it up again ...... until my junior year high school . looking through then-current issue magazine , i noticed way which it written made comprehensible nine year-old , or lowest common denomination older teenage readers . what i'm trying say this magazine totally dumbed-down . it doesn't give girls any credit able think creatively , let alone read above fourth-grade level . i also found content more childish superficial than other teen magazines ( although they all superficial extent - doesn't mean they don't make delightfully fun entertaining reading share friends ) . therefore , i recommend this magazine tweens ( 9-13 ) , tweens only . but even they better than this magazine . older readers should check out somewhat more sophisticated ' elle girl ' or ' cosmo girl ' , my two personal favorite s.p.s. i agree one other reviewers who pointed out numerous spelling errors magazine . possibly my biggest caveat constant misuse apostrophe ( i.e. tuesday instead tuesdays ) .	-1
i received this magazine gift ... i not renew . articles very short refer you websites , telephone numbers , etc . more information . why so little information magazine itself ? additionally , there load advertising : take out equation magazine would only few pages long . my money , there much more available elsewhere , including " google " search . waste paper , imho	-1

only reason i subscribe i found free subscription somewhere . magazine some interesting articles but most time they just completely wrong . one example preview last years nfl draft . they talked up terrell suggs long article point he definetely going latest third even quaterback needy bengals lions who really wanted rogers finding it hard take pass him . where he end up ? going baltimore ravens . not even his homestate team cardinals wanted him . example cover their college football preview . they picked auburn their national champions . i don't follow college football enough understand , but i know auburn lost its first two games doesn't look much like team vying national championship . i'm not saying sports illustrated perfect their picks always accurate , but they seem me get better grasp sports . yes sports illustrated ads , but looking through my last issue it doesn't seem sporting news any less . it takes while till you get least two consecutive non ad pages . it seems like they both same amount . even if one more ads than others it hard really turn page ? you lazy ? articles important thing not many people say ones sporting news better . i'd like hear what some people thought so nonsports related sports illustrated . i personally haven't seen anything non sports relat1ed . yes they reviews occasional sports themed book movie but they usually short just letting fans know whether its worth it	-1

christmas 2005 i decided i wanted most interesting best cooking magazines out there . but which ones pick ? after buying one here there i found three i absolutely love . saveur one . recipes nice though some i wouldn't touch ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients don't appeal me ) . but stories pictures ... they aren't just amazing , they're astounding ! where national geographic talks certain things or places , saveur takes you different places shows you what there how they eat . they showed me ireland i even made colcannon ( mashed potato cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made french dish last night amazing . it little time consuming but worth it ! i admit i little disappointed my first issue i received them my subscription . it looked like dog ate it then ran through water it . it readable but i wasn't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines new subscribers . i've never seen them . but i getting my magazines they look good . i thinking it other night , my three magazines i picked ... one articles recipes healthy eating ( eating well ) , one easier recipes no articles ( everyday food ) , then saveur . if i could only pick one keep ... it would saveur . it really good read .	1
you bet , this one . there only few mac oriented magazines out there they all wish they could this well written . this large format magazine each issue filled series how-to articles i consider best written , best illustrated easiest follow . i slog through some fairly dull reading but this magazine i would give my wife / daughter / co-worker explain how use ichat , hook up isight camera , customize ical , get started safari so . they review many new software tittles latest hardware goodies . since it magazine , reviews very current . each issue comes cd they starting include pdf copies prior issues , great reference	1
it true entrepreneur mag loaded ads -- but those ads interesting themselves . i always find it fascinating see what ads pop what ads junk -- it easy see difference . this opportunity develop your own advertising strategy ! content , there certainly room improvement . i personally enjoy entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they longer . i would like see more meat here . business several years now , i find most value this magazine comes front section where they list interesting tips , new products , survey results . not month goes i don't bookmark page so i follow up new product or check out website mentioned short piece . alone , low subscription price worth investmen t.t here lot information franchising , which great those interested this business model . though this not my personal cup tea , i still find it interesting read lists franchises notice trends popularity . who knew there so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one best general magazines available entrepreneurs . not every topic appeal every reader since we all run different kinds businesses seek different information . if you're looking something more specific your industry , trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you keep eye climate small biz world .	1
i thought my first issue your magazine little sparse . it very thin issue . models beautiful . this good . but you knowif you would include more depth articlessuch really depth stuff skin hair . like i said before aging skin needs more it some things like micro-dermabrasion could helpful . also 8 glasses water day most helpful thing woman could herself . beside plastic surgery , theres not much them . but i saythis , enlarge lips i put vitamin capsule my lips , then honey then good lip moisturizer leave it overnight . it doees make lips plumper . also i use baby powder my face face powder . sometimes i use this just my nose chin . sometimes i use half mayonaise conditioner mix them together make mayonaise smell better hair . sometimes i use vitamin oil my bath water such vitamin person buy this dollar store . im not rich but i some things help way i look my age . then you could include pictures mountains rivers stories people . then you could articles celebrities like frank converse , robert blake , really interesting ones like . paul newman always got something say interesting . also what ever happened actor richard hatch who starred hitchhikers ? someone told me other day most handsome actor there or yul brynner . i didnt see i should . i dont know if you agree or not but it would interesting see profile way he lived . i like brad pitt those people always great . i love jennifer anniston because she she higher up than most women her thoughts actions . angelina jolie i really like too beacause women like these women . i miss johnny carson they really need find someone replace him . yes there people like still world . ive found some them . well thank you	1

i've subscribing paste over year now , it great magazine . i agree what others said writing : interviewers often seem love their subjects deal musicians fans instead journalists . there tons reviews each issue wide variety bands music , sampler cd dvd worth subscription price all themselves . it great way listen bands you would never heard otherwise . if you love music spending small fortune cds , this magazine you . my only real criticism magazine it very text heavy , tons small print jammed onto each page , often background picture/design behind words , which makes it chore read . i would love see larger print less eye junk pages . then again , i'm closing 40 so younger eyes may not find it problematic	1

i heard this magazine even before i came this country it never disappointed me ever since i subscribed it . i valued it most among other photography magazines i subscribed . reason i find this magazine quot ; real stuffquot ; . equipment , it detailed objective test . articles not just obscure evaluation u find elsewhere , instance , it once said : quot ; ... based our field lab test , this amateur lens gives better performance than its professional counterpart ... quot ; , whereas other magazines , what u find probably quot ; this lens good , one nice ... quot ; . photo tips , it more insightful than just quot ; sunny 16quot ; or quot ; always use tripodquot ; . u find photographer own consideration why put composition this way but not . all , i think this magazine anyone who interested photography begin continue wit	1
when i little , my dad always said good things this magazine . my attitude always quot;i'm not gonna buy magazine bore myself some morequot ; - i mean , c'mon , it history magazine . i absolutely wrong . i picked up this magazine one day i hooked . i would say american heritage found its way make history interesting . one way it this somehow weave issues current interest ( subtle they may ) into its articles . second thought , i should listened my dad beginning - he anesthesiologist - he knows what put people sleep what not . this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so i could finish my copy one sitting . it unfortunate this magazine only comes out every two months . american heritage makes history grrreattt ! ... even non-history buff his early 20 like myself	1
world gaming , there specialized magazines each system ( playstation magazine , xbox mag , etc . ) , most which suck because they only report ( duh ) games their respective systems . others , like electronic gaming monthly , encompass most systems but only it half-assed , not really giving you anything make you think highly it . then , there gameinformer . there many things set gameinformer apart many other " gaming " magazines : 1 ) they completely unbiased opinions games they play . if game sucks , they say so ; if it awesome game , they'll tell you it . 2 ) matt helgeson ( senior gaming editor ) other editors actually inform you game most necessary attributes : its esrb rating ( ) , their rating game ( 1 10 ) , brief introduction game faults successes . best all , however , they include screenshots game- most screenshots rock . these just some reasons gameinformer magazine absolute best gaming magazine market . i subscription this magazine this magazine only , i hope my review explained why .	1
i used read online content this magazine ( i still check out blog ) , but i say there even more content magazine than there online , it really worth subscribing . articles well written usually change my mind issues i may not realized i mind change . i would recommend this magazine anyone	1
i subscribed details because i'm interested male psyche . i also like looking male celebrity pictures guy models ads . its not most politically correct article planet , one last page called " gay or ...? " which writer tries uncover if certain type person gay or not , no conclusion actually ever given so i suppose its reader decide . its very stereotypical part magazine , but beyond there cool articles read male perspectives . i also enjoy reading celebrity interviews , addition they include interviews female celebrities . i don't agree everything printed here , but certain articles made me think i've actually gotten lot out it . it helps me understand guys i agree certain opinions . mag leans toward liberal unabashed its attitude so . i like it lot , it may not everyone that fine .	1
man this it , great mag cool business people . what you not know , you after reading all this great info . read !!	1
i've subscriber over fifteen years , probably continue subscribe until day i die . but times i find national geographic frustrating . i no interest soccer , nor i want huge fold-out map discussing sport . aren't there more phenomenal things going world today ? also , geographic its pet topics . how many articles must we read pandas ? dozen ? i like pandas , believe me , but surely there other less cute animals discuss . also i could without lectures pc environmental propaganda . articles oil-drilling alaska filled thinly veiled agenda which preachy annoying . yeah , we get it , you don't want alaska drilled . we move , please ? other articles quite interesting . i enjoy zip code discussion , old-fashioned pictures , articles countries . i could fewer articles underwater archaeology though , articles filled preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring . friend mine ( joe average type guy ) , said he stopped subscribing geographic because articles depressing him . i tried argue him , because i think magazine great- but i kind agree , topics late downbeat aren't particularly uplifting . i believe magazine getting little ' out there ' its choice topics , too . i recommend this magazine those interested environment world around them	1
this excellent magazine . there very few magazines i choose read cover cover . this one few . photographs illustrate text accompany it just right . they gorgeous . writing clear concise interesting . topics they write include history , travel , historical objects , animals , places so . one monthly article fast become my favorite photographers . each month they highlight famous picture photographer who took it discuss what made picture important . they tell little bit photographer person who photographed ( if it person ) . this fascinating magazine well worth money . enjoy .	1
big 3 ( fortune , forbes , businessweek ) , i like fortune most . businessweek feels like it always copying someone or dying jump bandwagon next big thing . forbes good magazine but sometimes so original it veers too far its original purpose --- report analyze business world . fortune profiles people it chooses writes current events without just summarizing way businessweek	1

i scrapbooking more than five years , i my style rather simple . however , i recently found myself rut , i began wishing i could fancier pages , so i began receiving creating keepsakes . although i still no desire two page spread takes 5+ hours , this magazine great inspiring me try new things , well just giving me ideas both scrapbooking stamping , just first three issues my subscription . they fairly good job showing expensive way page , well more economical . additionally , there product reviews recommendations . i typically buy most my supplies at-home parties , i found very helpful recommendation silent eyelet setter . some their articles geared towards more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker . instance , recent article explained how use certain computer programs augment photos . results beautiful , but this just not up my alley . they also recently spread scrapooking rooms some their staff , i very , very jealous ! i may never any award-winning spreads , i probably never use my computer augment my pictures , but i know my scrapbooking more creative better looking due this magazine	1
yes , ew changed over years , but i believe it relevent now it ever . articles interesting reviews usually right mark . i read it cover cover .	1
what i like this magazine articles unique informative . i bought last three issues can't wait next one . this magazine covers equipment current mode rather than 6 months year behind style so familiar many other photography magazines . this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i picked one up . every article telling me or showing me how implement lastest techniques best photographers industry . beginning this year i noticed some " popular " or " modern " " digital review " magazines running same old head head comparisons consumer cameras out better part year now . i need see technology cutting edge or even around corner . so far this magazine giving me best bang my buck . good luck	1
here magazine focuses modern design clean-line architecture without trendy vibe makes competitor like " wallpaper " expensive , hit-or-miss read . what i like most " dwell " its consistency presenting interesting designs around world look quite livable fashionable same time . even advertisements quite compatible flow magazine , so much so they often look like they part editorial . there very useful " marketplace " section end tells you where get lot art , furniture accessories complementary designs presented . i often used these helpful listings find some interesting things my own place . this magazine definitely geared toward urban loft dweller , but i like how they highlight homes families mind well . individual issues often focused either geographic or utility-related themes , thus keeping library mandatory future reference . photography superb . if you tired design magazines seem talking specifically designers , this great , reasonably priced alternative people who simply appreciate great design . highly recommended	1

i subscribing this mag couple years , think it one best gaming mags available . i several different consoles , appreciate they review games all platforms . i like rating system ( 1-10 ) instead too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , find reviews well written objective . while i gaming years , i am not necessarily versed computer lingo , but i never feel like idiot after reading this mag ; writing erudite but very easy understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , feel this magazine strikes exactly right balance more serious more frivolous gaming magazines industry . one suggestion : if you gamestop or affiliated store your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . $15 you receive 12-year subscription , card gives you 10% off used games these stores , well extra 10% trade-in value your used games ( sometimes there coupon month mag upgrade 20% both ! ) .	1
car driver multi-purpose auto magazine . it hybrid magazines like road track , which focus exotic extreme auto world , magazines like motor trend , which focus more practical . magazine always fun , intereseting read , keeps you up date teh auto world . i must , however , say , it not good job rating cars motor trend , it doesn't quite coverage exotics road track ( definitely falls short road track superb photography . )	1
i first came across taste home magazine 10 years ago . some friends mine quite experimental couple who loved try out new recipes . recipient tasty appetizers , dips , desserts , i asked them recipes . it then they shared this magazine me ... i've subscriber ever since ! each magazine features several special features , well mainstay departments such potluck pleasers , my mom best meal , getting theme things , super snacks appetizers . arguably best part this magazine their clip-and-keep section recipes which feature color photos dish . just cut out recipe , ouila ! it ready your recipe box . other information-packed sections include ask our food editor , touring country kitchens , ted toothpick contest , lively leftovers , more . each issue also features recipe contest win cold , hard cash . some great recipes most recent issue include : swiss-stuffed porkchopsopen-faced turkey tacosspinach shrimp fettuccinecoffee ' ' cream browniescucumber potato saladasparagus chicken crepeshearty jambalayabarvarian strawberry pieand many more . besides tasty dishes , one great things recipes taste home they don't call some exotic ingredients . rather , they feature ingredients found any department store ... even if you live out-of-the-way rural area ! some recipes aren't exactly " quick " , which why i give it four stars . there certainly quite few quick easy recipes , but there also some take quite bit prep work . if you're looking magazine mostly quick recipes , try their sister publication , quick cooking ( i subscribe one , well ... actually like it better . ) taste home no ads ( amazing ! ) , so it nice magazine chock full recipes information -- not fillers ads . this magazine also very " country " , so if you're looking something trendy cosmopolitan , this mag may not you . but if you like down-home country cookin ' , you'll likely love this magazine	1

i heard " books culture . " i never read it . then good friend college called one afternoon told me he sending me gift subscription . i've never enjoyed periodical this much . it given me hope . when george . bush reelected word " evangelical " spoken across country blame . regardless your political stance , point evangelicals seen stupid enough reelect what much rest nation saw poor president . even today , " evangelical " often used connote backwardness or stupidity . but " books culture " blows this assumption out water . you stumbled across publication voice god-fearing perspectives gender roles church , current philosophy theology , current film literature , politics , economics , cultural phenomena such internet ? this " books culture " most recent issue , thoughtfully honestly written , even when conclusions reached seem somewhat outside traditional conception things . subculture , we love answers . but it seems we entering new period growth our communities , one which questions equally important appropriately valued . why not begin tough questions ? you'll find many them " books culture . " p.s. dennis , if you ever read this , thanks subscription , bud .	1
there certainly lot hate wine spectator - , matter , wine advocate . many winemakers decry existence both magazines , usually lay blame entirely robert parker doorstep making 100-point rating system industry standard . wine spectator scores gotten better time , their articles . they've shied away california " glitz " looked more into food . also , education classes they list their website becoming increasingly more helpful . apparently they listened much criticism worked toward creating more respected magazine . i think they've well .	1
this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	1
whether you technical guru or someone who emphasis words , any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously love american cinematographer . official magazine american society cinematographers , this magazine gives you depth interviews dps directors technical approach towards shooting picture . they cover not just lab soups lighting techniques , but also approach script , design notes how visually approach script - other words , great detailed overview how this particular crew filmmakers went creating visual language film . not just film - technology advances , more films shot video , this magazine gives same great coverage those pictures well - star wars anniversary party . while it true there only so many films ac cover each issue but i think you'll end up feeling like i - i wish they could cover them all	1
two years ago , i became subscriber shape , mainly because i received it free part package deal magazine . i always liked browsing through issues shape supermarket , i thought subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i enjoyed shape found it useful , but there definitely some negatives , magazine might not everyone . but first good . like many others mentioned , what i most enjoy shape their real-life weight stories featuring nice variety women , some whom actually needed * gain * weight order healthy . i also love their relatively new feature which they follow one their own staffers year-long weight loss journey . many their other regular features also excellent , particularly body part-focused strength exercises other how-to exercise guides . i especially like shape uses " reader models " so many their articles -- real life women various ages ( although admittedly , mostly 25-35 range ) normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations traditional exercises , recipes often quite good well . main negative already brought up many others here : use too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models illustrate much magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand sell magazines , models probably conform some traditional standards attractiveness , but those us buying magazine want see women who not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now then ! i said above , reader models great ; women usually quite fit , but they muscles curves too , which wonderful see . shape may trying make some improvements this area , last few covers featured famous women who exercise ( such denise richards ) , but they still long way go . while they're it , i hope they return their cover models dress fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they still show off their model physique showcase cute fitness wear same time . similarly , i would like see magazine get rid fashion segment end * unless * they start focusing it exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you overweight and/or new exercising , you may find magazine discouraging , but if you get past some negatives , it also inspiring . i think it up each individual determine whether magazine like this likely hurt or help her fitness efforts ; me , it helpful , but this definitely might not case everyone	1
i read this mag thru thru , some 20 + years now it continued top crop . it most superbly laid out designed magazine excellant content , i ever seen . totally honest , i would much rather read browse this any day over " print " magazine . this almost like graphic design book , just gets published every 2 months where best designers world given each 30 pages just go nuts . i found it deep stacks university library one day hooked ever since ... also those you who read/write japanese , german , english you your pick while reading ..	1
most this magazines travel articles ads not targeted someone like me . i'm homemaker limited budget . i don't travel much or am market fancy things they advertise . however , i just renewed my subscription becuase when i tried recipes magazine they really wonderful . i've added every recipe i've tried gourmet my ' keeper ' recipe binder . i admit , dishes harder make but results definitely worth trouble	1
relevant magazine great articles people who culture faith . many reviews secular artists , spiritual content or message ( or lack thereof ) music they sing , films they make books they write . they also review christian artists , many who fringe . this great magazine those who interested these things . if you just want ' youth-oriented ' christian magazine bible studies how-to you'll probably disapointed	1
potential interior designer , i find this magazine both realistic elegant articles it provides professional hobbiest . i subscription i find studying designers , styles themes i learned so much work designer . i would recommend it anyone who enjoys color , fabrics or just pictures beautifully designed rooms interiors	1
i like paula deen cooking , find i prefer order my magazines through amazon because they send me email update when my subscription really expire , so i choose renew , instead flooding me 6 months ' worth letters mail saying " renew now " or else , you'll miss issue . invariably , i never missed issue , but i certainly overpaid too soon sending subscription cards renewing too early when i may not wanted .	1

this pretty good magazine . niche it goes out every week thus it most current business news magazine out there ( if you compare it fortune , forbes ... ) . i always find 3-4 interesting articles there , but don't expect read cover cover	1
ordered this my son . sometimes it takes while , order reach him prison , so i'm not sure he received it yet . since you wrote reminded me , i'm thinking it get him , others returned	1
before i begin , there one thing you need know : i can't cook . i skills can't beaten when it comes heating stuff microwave , i use toaster oven , uh , toast things , but that it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals me , which probably makes me only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say great deal just how entertaining every day rachael ray actually . course , you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would weird someone buy this magazine if they didn't cook they also hated rachael , i'm not weird ! however , although this ostensibly cooking-centric magazine , i'd argue it really reflects rachael attitude personality . her enthusiasm , love wide variety food , adventurous spirit shine through every page . all reports , rachael very hands-on developing this magazine , it shows . those who ask why they need read rachael ray magazine , since rachael all over television these days ( most recently her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew this : rachael isn't taking over world accident . she obviously doing something right dominating both food network daily schedule bestseller lists ( her ever-increasing line cookbooks ) . people just can't get their fill her ! so , what exactly her secret ? i think it boils down these factors : combination approachability charisma , which key ingredients superstardom ( think talented-yet-friendly stars such tom hanks or shakira ) . add dash optimism mixed spirit adventure , witnessed my favorite ray show , " $40 day , " which she explores new tourist destination each week , trying eat well insanely low budget . but what rachael ray magazine form , you're wondering ? well , my opinion , every day rachael ray appeals all tastes brilliantly translating her unique appeal tv screen printed page . i mentioned earlier , i probably won't cooking anything many recipes included each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes picture finished product , recipes lots variety creativity ... yum-o ! some so simple , like sandwiches or salads , i get feeling i might actually able attempt them if i really wanted ( see ? rachael " can-do " attitude even gets through kitchen-incompetent ! ) travel articles short pieces ( wide range topics such buying cheese , making mistakes kitchen , etc . ) also fun . but , rachael fan , i especially enjoy parts magazine written , or , rachael . one nice feature which readers send questions rachael which she personally answers . someone who participated lot " celebrity a " online past , i love these chances get know more someone famous who you may never meet person . fact , only reason i haven't rated every day rachael ray " five stars " because i'd like see even more rachael-related photos articles each issue ... how cool would ?! also , i'm hungry more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but fair , this relatively new magazine , all great magazines need time sort out what doesn't work . so far , every day rachael ray hit ground running off great start . i actually first person buy very first issue my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky happened there they set up display ) , i've looked forward each new issue ever since day . if you like rachael ray , you can't go wrong here ... start spending every day rachael ray " take bite outta life . " even if you can't boil water !	1
this great foodie magazine . we think writing what makes it great . it always interesting , some recipes try not usual food mag stuff . very enjoyable	1

too many christians ignorant our rich past . we know lot 1st century current times , but everything somewhat blank . christian history magazine more than informative ; it inspires , challenges even admonishes its unique way . i look forward each issue . i doubt i ever let this expire	1
i know it takes eight weeks maybe longer but i appreciate information i've gained store bought " maximum pc " magazines . i don't build computers but when i order one , it nice familier workings attributes new computer . yes ... you find much information on-line generally faster than amount time it takes magazine reach your mailbox , however , great kick back away computer your favorite chair ' read ' it :) very good magazine ... but ' adult ' language used times not appear me professional use english language . thus 4 rather than five stars	1

american spectator must read anyone considering themselves intellectual . not only articles witty well-researched , they also provide well-articulated arguments most pressing ( if sometimes slighlty out date ) controversies times . well worth subscription price , or even cover price	1
this most accurate geo-political socio-economic english-language news-weekly there . period . articles succinct , top-notch , cover everything world today business , economics environment . i think magazine tends focus bit too little environment religion , but my perception . despite editorial style very sophisticated diction , articles still easy understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , it calls itself ) staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e. broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , pro-war iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , pro-european ( i.e. expansion eu ) . but it takes many conservative liberatarian positions , too , oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most points-of-view after reading just few articles same subject , although economist usually imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or world must take . actually that best part : it very refreshing magazine not afraid share its opinion offer its advice readers , hence its influence . this , me , icing cake . economics international relations student , i receiving economist some three years already . short time span , it source -- usually main source -- dozens my essays country reports ( country or topical surveys published every several weeks excellent this ! ) reading magazine increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel my vocabulary increased third-grade level college-level . yes , it indeed take few weeks get used unique writing style , but magazine indispensible . some it may appear arrogant , which what i tend sense times , but not mean it bad magazine . quite simply , it tends think itself sophisticated , rightfully so . while half-owned financial times , many economist authors also write latter , which help explain while two similar . but while financial times daily newspaper fairly brief articles 50-50 slant news finance/business , economist articles , while also succinct , focus everything world impacts people . why it excellent summary world this week those people little time their hands . finally , i not necessarily sense anti-semitic slant stated one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend regard economist proposed solutions -- such dealing hamas politically ( despite their " militancy " ) , they cannot destroyed -- middle east conflict mere pragmatism work . same its proposal legalize various drugs . not both these things ever happen today world ( mid-east conflict won't end ; drugs won't decriminalized most countries ) , but thinking purely pragmatic , which refreshing world so increasingly bent political correctness . this respect , aforementioned ones , i feel magazine lot more objective overall than many others , despite specific positions it takes particular articles . it makes truly fascinating read . it most surely investment it claims , so any those any remaining doubts , $129 subscription price ($77 students ) more than worth it . just read three or four issues you'll see . trust me	1
this magazine great recipies ! most them incredibly easy , but there few " adventuresome " ones every once while try when you feel up challenge . sometimes recipies need few more spices , so i usually add more than they say ( heck , it doesn't change calorie count ) . however , cooking light not trade calories taste , so whole family likes meal there many recipies i would proudly serve company ( majority , fact ) . there also just ton recipies per issue . only negative things i would say few recipies only marginally " healthy " sometimes there some redundancy . overall , it great buy	1

people most incredible magazine . writers magazine know exactly what you want read subscriber , but there always extra section just not interest you because no magazine attract every ones personal interests . no matter what this magazine always makes friday great day . i feel best part people magazine fact they give you special issues , like 50 most beautiful people , sexiest man alive , eligible bachelor . you get variety highlights each people issue . you find inside each issue many sections pertaining your interest . section called mailbox where you get read other people responses articles last issue released . passage page where they give you all details celebrities such marriages , births , divorces , deaths , injured , or convicted . finally , i love getting toward end magazine just able read true crime stories because they intriguing quite interesting . only bad part people magazine most people , just like myself , buy issues read celebrities . but you also get human interest stories which don't seem interest everyone . now i not subscription , but i read every issue , whether i buy them myself or read magazine work . i would say if you wanted purchase magazine this would great one choose because magazine reaches out any one their teenage years up	1

when funds tight i difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions keep . each women magazine slightly different feel writing , though increased competition , these styles seem flux . i finally decided i preferred writing bazaar getting tired what i felt vogue cosmopolitan attempt catch larger readership ( if i want subscribe cosmo , i'll bloody well subscribe ) . featured designers more cutting edge less mainstream than what found vogue . it bit snottier ( though there far snottier magazines if you looking extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar obviously thinner magazine , while most vogue content adverts , it seem more articles . item i find highly irritating , bazaar society items . i really don't give ---- who wearing what what charity gala , especially when i don't play footsies these people . those complaints aside , this still my favorite fashion magazine	1

someone who recently become more interested healthier , organic way life , i decided check out several magazines subject matter . many not strike my fancy . example , i found organic style magazine little too fashion product-oriented my taste , while mind , body , spirit fitness seems little too redundant doesn't cover natural organic living all . natural health , however , falls somewhere , covering nice array topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , food/recipes . someone who not interested explicitly holistic medicine naturopathy , i appreciate diversity this magazine offer . though many articles cover ideas products aren't entirely natural or organic , i still find them useful . many items articles , though not all , vegetarian-friendly well eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one my few complaints articles short , sometimes merely " glossing over " many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it decent jumping off point further research . though i can't compare previous version magazine everyone else seems preferred , i only began pick this up my local whole foods market last year , i say i am impressed what natural health offer it readers . sure , there several ads plaguing pages , but i still feel though there far fewer advertisements than many magazines shelves today . besides , some ads led me decent products i would not known otherwise . furthermore , this price , how anyone really go wrong	1

i agree this magazine boasts designer clothing extremely high prices most people cannot afford , but may people aware this magazine called " teen vogue " obviously follow it big sister footsteps . " vogue " not feature clothes walmart , so " teen vogue " not either . this magazine not necessarily cater only rich people . who says person should only buy magazine when she going get exact clothes featured it ? i am definitely no millionaire . i'm 16 years old still high school , but i enjoy this magazine immensely . course i dont slip out marc jacobs when i'm reading get myself shirt page 79 , but i look styles so i understand new trends just inspire myself some . magazines dont always realistic . fashion pursuing beauty covetting beauty , if all magazines only featured " affordable clothes ' walmart old navy , well .. i really wouldnt know what would like . " teen vogue " pure fashion magazine . it isnt all-round magazine young girls . it only fashion . it great job what it strives . fashion great taste great , shoots amazing . former reviewer reccomended " seventeen " i want note " seventeen " different type magazine entirely . seventeen extremely mainstream bubblegum not very fashion orientated . personally i not like magazine but i'm not going condemn it here . " teen vogue " classy , stylish , lives up it name . you dont rich kid read this magazine . but it only teen magazine out there which dedicated souly high fashion yes , features best fashion . people who not interested fashion probably hate this magazine , probably why it recieved so much criticism . i , other hand , love this magazine . only reason i didnt give it five stars because reviews above deemed stuff it affordable young girls strike me ridiculous . otherwise , look this magazine some fantastic fashion inspiration	1

revolver competing magazines heavy metal magazine world hit parader circus . i bought all three these magazines several times , revolver my final judgement revolver only magazine good enough subscribe . other two i still buy occasionally , but only wallpaper ( i cut out pictures bands magazines hang them my room . ) this magazine , way , like combination circus blender magazines ; it combines best aspects both . revolver still plenty great pictures , but it also much longer much better written than circus . it not quite long or stuffed full information blender , but make sure you note revolver only reports one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances , if hard rock band ( especially big name hard rock band ) or already released c.d. , revolver story it . stories/reports very entertaining but they also informative sometimes lesson learned them . if it cover story , interview band also included ; if it not cover story , writer integrates quotes answers band into article , anyways ( even though it not formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go tour band ( i.e. lamb god ) . case , they take reader backstage , tour bus , concert ( rundown show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there sexual theme it . there would picture " hot babe " t-shirt , one side poster would woman-usually half-naked-in sexual pose . past year or so , revolver phased out ( probably appeal broader audience ) . i sometimes miss pictures " hot babes , " but this way there more room real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex isn't theme anymore , revolver probably bit too sophisticated anyone younger than teenager . plus , there usually profanities ( mainly " word . " ) so , i would say this magazine ages 13 up . monthly articles : -cover story-3 or 4 other biggish stories- " fresh blood " column ( where small biography given band you probably haven't heard of)- ask vinnie ( column where readers write questions , pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice)- hard rock news notes- black death metal news notes- " studio " ( update bands currently recording new music)-free poster ( middle magazine , there fold-out poster one or two bands . ) poster isn't very wide , but it two pages long-free music downloads- " ink spot " ( story musician favorite tattoo)- " favorite sh*t " ( interview musician , questions such " what your favorite color ? " )-joke band ( revolver just recently started doing this)- reviews ( reviews . . ' , music dvd , video games)pros : -- plenty good pictures free poster -- professionally written well known writers ( yet it not too intelligent teenagers) -- edited well ( i haven't found any mistakes or typos)-the " fresh blood " column usually introduces me band i haven't heard , but i should probably check out -- revolver accredited well known enough allowed go tours bands first interviews -- news columns ( both mainstream underground metal bands)-the stories always quotes band report -- free music ! ( revolver started doing page gives reader password , which he/she then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions interviews ( they ask up date questions , sometimes- i.e. interview puddle mudd-the writers aren't afraid ask daring , cutting questions) -- " studio " segment always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they don't automatically praise every heavy metal . . ) cons : -- if you're up date your music news web sites , news columns shouldn't really anything new you . -- not all . . ' reviewed ( they give rundown c.d. article band , but . . ' bands cover magazine aren't usually reviewed . ) -concerts aren't reviewed-my biggest gripe it only issued once month . bottom line , if you're metalhead , this best magazine you get ! it more than well worth ten dollars you spend years worth entertainment	1
... while , yes , i've made comments past how oprah changed little , this publication . i'm sure person who wrote " this just magazine full things one can't afford " reads fashion or celebrity magazines full many things she can't afford . advertising generates money , while i don't like ads either , they everywhere because advertising works . if you don't want see them , don't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . far layouts " too full clutter " ... everyone their own style . there some people who like look don't prefer pared-down , zen look . magazines not reality . if they , they wouldn't plastered plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i'm originally middle america , nobody looks like there . just take magazines ads what they . save your money , like i , things you just . if you don't perserverence , then stick target walmart circulars . knock-offs never far behind .	1

no other magazine i'm aware gets more undeserved criticism than rollingstone . writing supurb . i don't know why everyone assumes pop culture magazines must all sensationalist rags same vein teen beat . complaining too many talentless teen icons put cover pointless -- it after all magazine delves into pop culture . not liking subject matter isn't just cause criticize . record review section best any music mag . it 100% idiotic assume their reviews bogus just because some band or group you wouldn't ever consider listening anyway got " good " rating . beauty their reviews they pander neither music elitists nor so-called " teeny-boppers , " their reviewers smart enough able differentiate what makes good pop music what makes good experimental music . rollingstone not specialty magazine that going say certain type music great type crap . it just music pop culture mag , damn good one	1

this most accurate geo-political socio-economic english-language news-weekly there . period . articles succinct , top-notch , cover everything world today business , economics environment . i think magazine tends focus bit too little environment religion , but my perception . despite editorial style very sophisticated diction , articles still easy understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , it calls itself ) staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e. broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , pro-war iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , pro-european ( i.e. expansion eu ) . but it takes many conservative liberatarian positions , too , oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most points-of-view after reading just few articles same subject , although economist usually imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or world must take . actually that best part : it very refreshing magazine not afraid share its opinion offer its advice readers , hence its influence . this , me , icing cake . economics international relations student , i receiving economist some three years already . short time span , it source -- usually main source -- dozens my essays country reports ( country or topical surveys published every several weeks excellent this ! ) reading magazine increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel my vocabulary increased third-grade level college-level . yes , it indeed take few weeks get used unique writing style , but magazine indispensible . some it may appear arrogant , which what i tend sense times , but not mean it bad magazine . quite simply , it tends think itself sophisticated , rightfully so . while half-owned financial times , many economist authors also write latter , which help explain while two similar . but while financial times daily newspaper fairly brief articles 50-50 slant news finance/business , economist articles , while also succinct , focus everything world impacts people . why it excellent summary world this week those people little time their hands . finally , i not necessarily sense anti-semitic slant stated one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend regard economist proposed solutions -- such dealing hamas politically ( despite their " militancy " ) , they cannot destroyed -- middle east conflict mere pragmatism work . same its proposal legalize various drugs . not both these things ever happen today world ( mid-east conflict won't end ; drugs won't decriminalized most countries ) , but thinking purely pragmatic , which refreshing world so increasingly bent political correctness . this respect , aforementioned ones , i feel magazine lot more objective overall than many others , despite specific positions it takes particular articles . it makes truly fascinating read . it most surely investment it claims , so any those any remaining doubts , $129 subscription price ($77 students ) more than worth it . just read three or four issues you'll see . trust me	1
i could not carry life i know it without economist . no hype . it good . this american reviewer became hopelessly addicted economist news analysis during four years england . magazine - or ' newspaper ' , it stubbornly insists calling itself - published london , though 2005 largest national readership united states . editorial line libertarian more moderate european sense word . essential values individual liberty , modest state , free market economics . don't let name fool you . this weekly far more than economist rag . its anonymous writing current events if fabulous , not mention top-ranked analysis letters , arts , like . let me give you concrete example how economist excels . years , i paid close attention its coverage latino immigration issues usa . one might suppose british magazine would disadvantage when exploring this complex topic , yet economist coverage routinely surpasses us newspapers magazines , perhaps largely because its disdain self-suppressing ' pc ' tactics . only area which i detect broad deficiency this magazine coverage role religion , particularly america . secularist european spectacles its editors wear seem make it impossible them canvass this phenomenon view religion continued fervor advanced western nations something other than retrograde slightly amusing . i tell my university-age nephews - thankfully , they ask - anchor their news consumption one weekly , then read widely beyond it . economist very best anchor available english-reading sailors	1

i subscribed multiple photography magazines first when i started getting serious photography . i subscribed ' photography ' ' american photo ' this one , popular photography imaging . three this magazine most balanced amount reviews , ' how tos ' , digital imaging related topics ( photoshop , etc ) well some nice contests . also they seem sponsor more ' mentor series ' type products where you go some locale shoot photos reasonable fee . all magazines this also something important me - half magazine isn't ads . photography worst offender this , there'd 50 or so pages weak articles , then 50 pages solid ads . while this one chunk ads near back , it still ' back page ' article articles mixed among ads . only 25% magazine advertisements . they also support nice online website ( popphoto.com ) forum where people logon ask questions . while not heavily trafficked say dpreview.com authors editors read respond questions . overall great magazine hobby	1
yes - there tons great shots mag ; great articles ( french only ) , contests --- very chic .... however ---- customer service treat you like redheaded stepchild when you ask them " why you not sent me latest issue photo ??

i only got first issue , but it seems focused more poets than other writers ( hence name ) . i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction . they might well keep two separate , especially contests events . it attractive format very upscale , high quality literature reviews advice . stories well written enjoyable , although i think writers digest offers more fiction writers	1
atlantic classic cultural , political literary voice america . first published team included legendary icons such ralph waldo emerson , oliver wendell holmes henry wadsworth longfellow , this periodical went include articles great historical figures such mark twain , woodrow wilson martin luther king jr. it may hard place current contributors next those specific individuals who came before them , but they stand tall contemparies published similar venues . this not magazine those who currently feel they well enough informed current crop " news-tainment " programs , talking heads mouthpieces found air waves today . here you'll find in-depth , critical analysis intelligent literature . you disagree some points view might you feel compelled label something it pages conservative or liberal ? maybe , but it understandable today climate . i would suggest you'd probably trying too hard , perhaps unconsciously , fit authors articles into particular partisan column . letters editor tend highlight differing points view so i encourage you read back following month see how others respond get feel magazine . i think most reasonable people tend find this magazine well worth time read regularly . recently there usually one full length article related issue middle east each month , which should expected current events , but content varies significantly within each issue you won't feel overwhelmed . there regular sections columns ranging travel book reviews fiction " post mortem " profiling some notable world figure who recently passed away . way comparison , harper new yorker probably closest style , though new yorker comes out weekly ( mostly ) instead monthly ( mostly ) like atlantic harper . if you're trying decide three , pick up each them two or three months see which you like best . i prefer atlantic overall , but if i time , i may pick up one or other if some particular topic it particularly interest me . bottom line , you could lot worse than subscribe atlantic	1
this monthly magazine opinionated breath fresh air . it philosophically allied libertarianism , but it not extreme or strident . reason more mainstream moderate than left or right ; it really political common sense . i don't always agree articles , but i rarely object reasoning supports them . point view isn't beholden agendas or special interests , read reason .	1
reason cannot labeled conservative or leftist . nor it extremist libertarian magazine like liberty , fawning over ayn rand . it bases its commentary assumption , if we some faith , our chaotic culture lead somewhere good . but if we try monitor control it excessively , we dampen human creativity end up muddled conflicted . reason takes all aspects culture assumes international perspective . its arguments laid out carefully but contain percolating sense indignation our increasingly repressive environment . same time , they more informative than polemical ; each report grounded specifics - quotes , anecdotes , studies . this most intelligent inquiring " political " journal available . if only it came out more often	1

two years ago , i became subscriber shape , mainly because i received it free part package deal magazine . i always liked browsing through issues shape supermarket , i thought subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i enjoyed shape found it useful , but there definitely some negatives , magazine might not everyone . but first good . like many others mentioned , what i most enjoy shape their real-life weight stories featuring nice variety women , some whom actually needed * gain * weight order healthy . i also love their relatively new feature which they follow one their own staffers year-long weight loss journey . many their other regular features also excellent , particularly body part-focused strength exercises other how-to exercise guides . i especially like shape uses " reader models " so many their articles -- real life women various ages ( although admittedly , mostly 25-35 range ) normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations traditional exercises , recipes often quite good well . main negative already brought up many others here : use too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models illustrate much magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand sell magazines , models probably conform some traditional standards attractiveness , but those us buying magazine want see women who not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now then ! i said above , reader models great ; women usually quite fit , but they muscles curves too , which wonderful see . shape may trying make some improvements this area , last few covers featured famous women who exercise ( such denise richards ) , but they still long way go . while they're it , i hope they return their cover models dress fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they still show off their model physique showcase cute fitness wear same time . similarly , i would like see magazine get rid fashion segment end * unless * they start focusing it exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you overweight and/or new exercising , you may find magazine discouraging , but if you get past some negatives , it also inspiring . i think it up each individual determine whether magazine like this likely hurt or help her fitness efforts ; me , it helpful , but this definitely might not case everyone	1

regular readers my reviews probably getting sick me mentioning kage baker , but i credit her getting me try lot things i wouldn't normally try if she hadn't part them . asimov science fiction magazine time where this case . while i bought fantasy science fiction magazine every month while now , i would also check asimov see if it baker story . if it , i would buy it . what i found , however , i enjoyed most other stories issues i bought well . thus , now i buying it every month too . much like fantasy science fiction , asimov contains mostly science fiction stories various lengths ( short story , novelette , novella ) couple columns some cartoons . difference two asimov contains no fantasy ( though some mike resnick stories fantasy feel them ) . however , magazine likes concentrate character-based science fiction , so you won't see lot " technology first , character second " stories magazine . personally , i think that good thing hard science fiction turns me off . if you're more into hard sciences , you may find stuff here interest you , but there good chance you won't . occasionally , there guest editorials ( they printed george r.r. martin guest honor speech worldcon october/november issue ) . there always " books " column , sometimes written paul di filippo , sometimes peter heck . authors use this column recommend books you may not come across . robert silverberg opens each issue " reflections " column cover everything space exploration ideas story-writing . james patrick kelly occasionally featured " net " column , examining various science fiction web sites other online activities . unlike fantasy science fiction , there often some poetry included well . finally , there calendar upcoming conventions covers world so you always find someplace go if you need get together group fans . bread butter magazine , though , stories . each story introduction editor ( currently gardner dozois , though change sheila williams january issue ) , which may explain genesis story , or just tell us how long it since author appeared asimov . one things asimov different it often serializes stories eventually appear book form . allen . steele coyote series serialized over last couple years all them collected two books ( coyote couple years ago , upcoming coyote rising ) . also , charles stross ' accelerando featured recent issues . one drawback this readers who only pick up occasional issue . instance , " survivor " october/november issue didn't really mean lot because i've missed everything came before it . it reward regular readers , though . asimov many writers who write almost exclusively magazine , or very least authors submit their stories this magazine first refusal . my favourite , kage baker , only seems appear here , only one story i know appearing realms fantasy . allen . steele . robert reed seems featured everywhere ( i swear guy churning them out like he machine ) but he featured lot asimov . magazine bound just like fantasy science fiction , however cover thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it tear bit easier . this advantage you sometimes leave it lying open reading ( though this only works if you're toward middle it ) . it also means it rolled up if necessary . only other fault i it , this strictly personal thing , stories don't always grab me much they fantasy science fiction . this mainly because i'm more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly wouldn't case everyone . while hit miss ratio varies issue issue , i say i never skipped story magazine . again , that benefit short fiction . you're not going waste lot time them . if i choose two magazines , i would definitely choose fantasy science fiction . however , asimov certainly good enough it easy make room both them . plus , picking them both up , i feel like i'm doing my part keeping short fiction alive . it only small part , but every little bit helps . david ro	1

i find interesting articles every issue i receive . i like fact articles offer wide range topics . example , you find articles relating diet , travel , relationships physiology . all issues provide yoga sequences you practice home . magazine offer advanced sequences more physically demanding simplier ones much less physically demanding . articles portray nicely sized color photos pose in-depth explanations how perform each pose . i am visual person who needs see more complex poses performed front me rather than described writing , so unfortunately , i can't take advantage some more difficult sequences . however , if practicing yoga some time familar enough wide range poses , or follow in-depth written instruction , you enjoy these sections . you may surprised volume advertisements found each issue . it doesn't bother me because there still remains plenty good reading each issue . you receive only 7 issues 12 month period . it would nice receive one every month . overall , entertaining informative magazine i recommend . yoga journal also fantasic website you explore free . website offers many interesting articles provides instruction information many common yoga poses .	1

american girl magazine geared girls aged 7-13 . much younger than many girls aren't reading appropriate level yet . much older they may ready move . but honestly i'm surprised read so many reviews 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old this magazine . i don't believe girls age need magazines based solely makeup tricks , flirting boys , etc . ag articles such dealing relationships friends . like when you your best friend start grow apart . or when she moves away . articles like one girl whose family travels around world their sailboat two years . crafts you actually proud give age 10 . several reviewer complained magazine short expensive . it . but here why : there no advertising ( short anything american girl related ) . many magazines , advertising accounts easily half pages . advertising enables publishers sell magazines low cost . ag no advertising so charge fair price produce it . i'm more than willing pay kind publication . parents ordering your daughters , you know your girl . if you've got 10 year old going 16 , this may not your child . if you precocious 6 year old , she might like it well . ag kind magazine i'm glad my daughters enjoy	1

us weekly used cross people national enquirer - ever since new editor stepped ( it seems they new one every year ) magazine revamped . it looks more like classy people less like trash tabloid . i'm also little skeptical those who complain amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines . not every business perfect , but i haven't problem my magazines delivered when i've ordered them amazon.com . it just makes me think all people whining just taking out their frustrations life amazon.com . maybe its why we see so many vicious jealous reviews , if you don't like your life change it . don't complain it , that how most people get where they today . anyway , unlike people , us weekly mainly focuses celebrities i think its price its far too short . least people thick . anyhow , celebrity junkie , us weekly must read . like reviewer , i too am tired reading jessica simpson brangelina . i think celebrity magazines tired this well . i'm starting see more diverse focus celebrities magazines . its certainly much better than reading touch life style weekly . although i like us weekly , i still think people best . people more classy , great layout , their focus 50/50 celebrities articles average folks . they great photos other interesting reads their magazine . even their website great , us weekly website looks like barbie website . recent changes great but if us weekly really wants compete people then it needs step up plate more . despite its faults , us weekly luscious read worth all its frothiness , so enjoy it .	1

this my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine all time . perhaps it fortuitous coincidence , but " cottage living " always features homes areas country very interesting me - like adirondacks , boulder co , arlington va , asheville nc new orleans . editors good understanding cottage admirers their interests . therefore , they include floor plans , before after pictures , brief back-stories give us glimpse into life cottages their inhabitants . we get see cottages very different characters based their geographic region , their original purpose , style socioeconomic standing their owners . some homes really stretch definition cottage because their large size , but - usually - they convey spirit snug informal home anyway . we see cottage owners very ingenious using all interior space available . i love see how people used dormers , areas under staircase , other niches things activities would otherwise not practical because limited square footage . small space used wisely attractively challenge all cottage owners face . this magazine provides ideas galore .

one american evangelicalism sympathetic critics once asked whether there such thing christian mind . all sorts reasons - some more than justified - questioners , skeptics , malnourished pilgrims produced negative responses query . but perhaps things better than all . if encouragement ma taken books culture : christian review , there hope kind wide-ranging integration faith intellect so routinely dismissed implausible cynical , misinformed those who yet discover intellectual renaissance among evangelicals populated university departments ( philosophy physics spring mind parade examples ) proponents robust biblical faith . publication christianity today empire , books culture provides forum some most incisive writing cutting-edge thinking found among christians anywhere . one not talking puff pieces cotton-candy testimony . rather , kind thoughtful self-critical engagement great conversation myriad contemporary issues one expects fat intellectual monthlies reviews new york london times offer here , abundance . this reviewer - who fights his wife possession issue sometimes finds them tucked away bedroom squirrel-holes which she believes him ignorant - watched this young-ish paper emerge something renegade among evangelical organs find its voice stride within just few years . its trajectory not far astonishing . christian century once known thought this quality still hits occasional home run . if it cans sustain its current run , books culture , looks rather . 325 hitter which franchise glory made	1

all music orientated magazines i subscribe , outburn my personal favorite . this only magazine caters my favorite music ... techno , goth , industrial music . rolling stone stopped relevant 10 years ago . spin magazine joke . alternative press also joke stopped relevant many , many moons ago . i discovered outburn when i saw article one my personal favorite bands all time , vnv nation . rolling stone , spin , ap wouldn't touch vnv nation ten foot pole because it isn't popular brainwashed masses . last year . since then , i loyal reader well loyal subscriber quarterly magazine . what appeals me most outburn magazine covers more than just goth industrial music but also lesser known metal bands like lacuna coil opeth . i'm not metal fan long shot but it refreshing read magazine which heavy metal bands [ pooh ] mtv clear channel , er , radio plays non-stop ( i.e korn , deftones , limp bizkit ) . outburn covers lesser known metal bands mtv wouldn't dare play except maybe new incarnation " headbanger ball " . i also enjoy original questions writers throws artists bands they interview . they also don't sound patronizing or condescending one bit . unlike spin magazine which now become forum video games fashion opposed music , outburn sticks what it knows best which music . although marilyn manson cover new issue outburn , least i grateful editors didn't throw good charlotte cover . thing i love outburn free cd offer subscribers . nothing beats like free cd . my only problem outburn it quarterly magazine , not monthly magazine . i wish rags like ap , spin , rs quarterly magazines outburn monthly but all its worth , least outburn reliable terms quality articles doesn't insult my intelligence throwing justin timberlake christina aguilera cover like rs recently . outburn truly one few magazines i enjoy reading word word	1

if you one whose definition rock music fairly elastic whose taste rock music eclectic , then i recommend mojo magazine you . i haven't read all magazines relating music course , but those i , mojo best job covering music scene today . its approach fresh its appeal wide . unlike some other music mags around , it one whole family read probably find something musically meaningful each . its writers , whose taste music broad , approach music without allowing personal prejudices color their articles . they find much merit new nick cave cd they new bert bacharach effort , if music worthwhile they it without gushing . recent issue highlighted bob dylan , marianne faithfull , sid vicious sex pistols each which certainly appeal different audiences . thing i like best mojo each issue comes cd featuring various artists doing whatever type music focus month lead article . cd really adds value me anticipating next one . i never thought i'd like sex pistols , but when i heard feature cd songs influenced them , i understood their music lot better . you might get better deal magazine than offered here if you go bookstore , find magazine , look insert bearing special offer . that what i . whatever way you decide try magazine up you , but i'd surprised if you didn't find it informative , enjoyable , money well spent	1
if you fan certain genre music , it mainstream pop , punk or hip-hop , there least few magazines cater your taste . rarity magazine caters all-around pop music fanatic , mojo magazine tops obscure lis t.t his pricey publication , but well worth money . since discovering magazine several years ago , i amazed diversity cover features alone : beatles , abba , frank zappa , kate bush , white stripes , michael jackson , rolling stones , sex pistols , madonna ... there something everybody taste , plenty people wide range musical taste . cover features inside , i am always amazed space they give performers and/or bands small cult following . i especially enjoyed piece they incredible string band several years back . they usually when covering group history , mojo writers not shy away friction low points involved band career . no tabloid trash-talking or finger pointing , just good solid journalism ; showing strengths makes icon popularity endure , bumps road ended ride . reviews cds plenty , i often find myself discovering something new add my collection . you'll find reviews pop , punk , folk , blues , country , classic rock , you name it ! i also find reviewers lot more open minded when reviewing albums , which welcome holiday plethora snobbish music critics who go out their way trash good efforts . mojo , my humble opinion , top music mags . if you over all pop-culture fan like i am , always lookout something new add your collection , then mojo magazine should key resource your database !	1

i reader fan dog world since i my first dogs 1981 . avid dog-lover since childhood , i always enjoyed breeder ads discovering breeds new me . these days one my favorite sections " rare breeds " . i thoroughly enjoy bi-annual " all breed " special issue . although each issue profile breed dog , what i like better than dog fancy profiles more informative in-depth . dog world also covers rare breeds their profiles , not just akc breeds . i would recommend dog world dog professionals avid dog-lovers involved dog sports ; dog fancy more casual dog people	1

growing up church , i've received lot christian magazines , depth analysis scripture , qa highschool drama help , but all fallen short what young christians today looking . i followed relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine kept up amazing articles online . i very excited debut magazine made god relevant specific everyday life decisions made god seem ever more practical way we construct our lifestyles . god obviously great things this staff still working . their podcast also great really demonstrates character today young christian thinkers who excited their faith willing show it . they bring lot hope pray christians living culture denies christ . i'm not twentysomething quite yet , but message relevant important which : put away your indifference go out make mark culture glory god	1
relevant magazine reaches our culture , rather than form its own christian sub-culture . while magazine definetly aimed towards " 20-something " demographic it still speak all generations . it covers most important topics facing our world today , christian secular . it also covers books , movies good music . interviews include , cameron crow ( director " elizabethtown " " vanilla sky " ) , bono u2 , lovedrug copeland . writing somewhat shallow times , but overall isn't bad . magazine fit finish second none christian magazine market , thick glossy pages colrful , thick covers , although it could longer . this surely one best christian mags out there today . if your christian ready move christianity into next generation , i would highly recomend this magazine . if you like music i would recomend paste magazine , its owned christian covers some most excellent music around today	1
quite frankly this only cooking magazine i ever subscribed i actually looked forward using receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! format magazine makes it easy follow recipes - they always printed two pages across each other - unlike some other posters i prefer black white format so paper thicker doesn't tear easily . tear away ads ( their own products ) outside magazine means usable portion doesn't take up much space my shelf . recipes easy follow usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there usually also substitution listed . their product reviews terrific - i wish i hadn't wasted so many dinners bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , someone who not dishwasher , great number bowls kitchen tools recipes require . i made least half recipes magazines , many several times , which no small feat " flexitarian " who never meat main dish .	1
prevention more guilty pleasure me than anything else . it definitely not magazine you file away your beloved books ( i victoria , real simple , o ) , but you take little something each issue . it contain lot excellent information ranging herbs emotional health physical conditions , but articles really more than one or two pages long ( most ) it doesn't take long read cover cover . regardless , i enjoy it , usually learn something new interesting each issue . i'm not complete health nut , but i am interested long term issues try look out myself . most health magazines ( exception health ) too specific- each article really only applies certain group people , but most articles prevention apply entire readership whole . there very few us out there not struggling stress or interested ways preventing heart disease or cancer	1
macworld glossy monthly around long apple making macs . i've subscriber most time - if i saved past issues - could probably paper cupertino main streets this periodical pages . there number magazines devoted macs their unusually devoted users . macworld probably most mainstream dependable them . most periodicals dedicated high-tech fields , there more these pages than casual user digest . many articles appeal macgroupies subset macusers , those who find product fascinating itself rather than merely boon productivity dedicated other ends . however , even normal macuser like myself ( since 1987 ) enjoy coverage all things apple , including constant improvements which company become known relentless speculation what comes next . small tornado controversy brews pages over whether macworld should dedicate so much space ipod music issues , but apple seems fairly dictated its sprint direction magazine dedicated covering company products need follow direction it sets . there lots productivity hints - if followed - keep you increasing your own effectiveness machine . most useful feature me high-quality discussion improvements apple continues build into its own operating system(s ) . macworld go-to mac magazine , if that what you need	1

someone who reads lot magazines who left-liberal , i remain stalwart supported new republic . this despite fact , yes , they supported iraq war . their crucial failing enterprise they assumed bush would work democrats , etc ., actually get job . it easy anti-war left bash them after fact , but least you say they take moral ethical high road : they've advocating military intervention humanitarian grounds years , even if , case iraq , they made many mistakes , fact they represent american left willing intervene non-self-interested grounds important itself . many people suggested tnr steadily moved right under tenure martin peretz , but they remain committed some most important issues american liberals : universal health care , gay rights ( their most conservative editor , after all , andrew sullivan , openly gay republican ) progressive economics . jonathan chait probably best political-economics journalist working us today . yes , they decidedly centrist , yes , they feature large number conservative writers , finally yes , they unapologetically pro-israeli middle east issues which puts off american college left , but their analysis top notch , their reporting incredibly insightful , despite no longer " in-flight reading air force one , " they remain indispensable anyone wanting understand washington elite . arts front they're even more consistent : stanley kaufmann film criticism insightful top-notch ; i wish they more robert brustein theater , though least you give them credit national magazine which still drama desk . jed perl often insufferable his art criticism , but he very smart engaging . leon wieseltier , literary editor , one i like least , he given long , wincingly verbose pieces ( rarely books ) , but he one eminences grise american literary criticism . more engaging controversial james wood , whose occasional fiction reviews absolutely worth reading ; again , i rarely agree him , but he indispensable . just because you agree believer more doesn't make them more interesting read . basically , tnr great anyone who actually interested what going wants intellectually challenged ; end , i rarely outright agree their writers , but unlike nation or mother jones , they don't bother preaching choir , writing much better ( end , i only kept my nation subscription going arthur . danto occasional art pieces ) .	1

i'm usually not one taking chance new magazines ( especially if they've shoved down public throats or oprah winfrey endorses it ) but this one instance where oprah gets major-league credit putting her faith money rachael ray . i impressed magazine layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - recipes contained within delicious easy prepare ( you won't go searching every speciality shop country ingredients , either ) . i also like how rachael let readers her italian wedding african safari honeymoon . unlike other celebrities , she didn't let us know too much information ( thank you ! ) i'm sure her recommendations trattorias , cafes , hotels tuscany worth time easy budget . just because she doesn't initials besides her name culinary degree ( she not only one food network lacking this ! ) , rachael spent her whole life restaurants food she learned same tricks trade fusion chefs network know . this definitely worth look i'm seriously considering ordering subscription .	1

art america seems won vote most popular periodical arts . quality reporting world events , informed writers who critique investigate , style referencing used articles makes this magazine immensely readable . this not most sophisticated journal art ( modern painters some other european magazines win there ) , but balance coverage reviews america well international scene very fine . ads well designed reproduced - even if there few too many ' vanity spaces ' . constant all available art magazines stand complaint overemphasis new york gallery reviews : new york not hub it once importance los angeles , san francisco , chicago , etc not recognized writers/editors . exhibitions reviewed solid reportage , if unduly weighted edgy installation quirky art . but august issues gallery guide this magazine them all topped !	1

friend mine told me " fast company " year ago , i subscriber avid reader since then . magazine enigmatic , combining news magazine , cultural commentary , business reporting , entrepreneurial insights into one publication . many issues deserve five star rating , but occasionally cohesion editorial focus bit uneven . thing i most like " fast company " 21st century approach news analysis : it thought provoking , explores all sides complex issues , but never tries tell reader what think . perfect example this april , 2006 issue article " al jazeera ( global ) mission , " which former us marine now working english-language version al jazeera profiled extremely multi-faceted story . entrepreneurial bent magazine great younger managers small business professionals , reporting market trends second none . although there times i don't agree articles or editorials " fast company , " i always find them intellectually stimulating thought provoking . i recommend this magazine independent thinkers everywhere	1

yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como , seventeen , cosmopolitan , vogue , self , glamour , mademoiselle , teen , lucky , teen vogue , marie claire , por mencionar algunas , tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol definitivamente me quedo con elle . es superior las demas , primera tiene excelente fotografia muy buenas impresiones , su moda es cosmopolita global , ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente la fama , sus propuestas reviews sobre cine , musica , libros teatro tambien son muy buenos , tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes de ahi no salen . sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran las drogas , tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 1 millon de dolares , por favor pongan algo mas accesible economico . tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos , ya sea de salud , relaciones , sexo , belleza , politica , cultura o decoracion , estos son variados algunos son muy buenos , otros aburridos , otros son superficiales o estupidos , otros son solo trivialidades . pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena , pero eso si es muy elitista , esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio , que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad , que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas , diferencia de cosmo , glamour , marie claire que claman ser feministas en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas , elle si les da un buen lugar sus lectoras , en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo tarugadas de como contentar tu hombre , amigo o lo que sea , convertirte en una barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar	1

play definitely breath fresh air someone who truly engulfed second-hand suck . years magazines like egm , gamepro ( shudder ) , only multi-platform magazines i would read . i later became tired their increasing ridiculousness , both content reviews , so after suggested i check out this magazine many fellow gamers i decided , hesitantly , so . i mean how different could multi-platform magazine ? very . not only am i captivated wonderful choice cover art each month ( amazon should change display cover over shadow colossus one ) , but pages size publication more professional than any gaming mag currently out . ( i admit not read game informer , due their paper mario : thousand year door fiasco , i never intend . ) i could only think myself stupid not heeding words others sooner . my first copy issue 39 , march 2005 , sega choice cover main content month . wow , there content . nice spread sega upcoming lineup , interviews company people/developers captivated me more . reviews awesome , still awesome well , sometimes spilling over 2 pages more frequently than " competitors . " i knew right away this what i looking : magazine liked all kinds games wasn't afraid show it both previews reviews , magazine not insult my intelligence , nor choice games . i not seen one word " kiddie " or " baby game " attack because colorful sprites , or lighthearted content . quite contrary , magazine seems ardent its protection 2-d games , games just fun regardless how they look ; something very welcome this day age gaming . i also like how they some biting criticism , but still seem upbeat . take their 2005 e3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything show itself , phantom games , specs next-gen hardware , but still positive things say them . not only , but magazine , once again , incredible coverage . how some interviews people such : hideo kojima ( metal gear ; boktai ) , tomonobu itagaki ( doa ; ninja gaiden ) , atsushi inaba ( viewtiful joe ; okami ) , koji igarashi ( castlevania ) , michael ancel ( rayman ; beyond good evil ; king kong ) , takao miyoki ( phantasy star universe ) , masato maegawa ( ceo treasure) ? simply incredible . not mention their brilliant cover story shadow colossus interviews developers . i cannot say enough how good this magazine . if i could use my years knowing gaming mags , sum up what magazine like , i would say it like cross now gone next generation , gamefan its anime section -- but very much mind its own . ( those worried anime section , it located back , so you won't miss out anything gaming related if you choose skip over it . ) i seriously implore you give it chance , even if you fan other magazines . go your local bookstore look through it , you don't purchase it , just see yourself . hopefully , you'll experience true difference play	1

(...) other magazines write similar topics outrageously priced their articles misleading you never learn anything actual relevance topics cover . one prime example this us weekly . i read several issues this past usually way someone giving mag me when they it i've actually only personally bought us weekly twice . but it style annoys me it magazine wants write interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails . please not confuse touch us weekly . what i sometimes think other people might easily dismiss touch like us especially since they sometimes feature same celebs right next each other newstands . touch keeps you " touch " celebrities their important/interesting stories happening week week their lives . but you don't feel like stalker or something reading this magazine i read other people comment us . touch always stays safe distance celebs personal lives not cross line their articles no matter who or what article written touch keeps up respectful tasteful point view subject/celebrity hand . they also talk important things public eye , such this weeks issue these few stories : people news section : cynthia nixon brand new life - this article talking how cynthia now found love happiness her life her lover woman . i no clue this till reading article . article just tells straight up facts , quote one cynthia friends saying " she totally love nothing hide . she two beautiful kids , money bank , incredible career , emmy career , now girlfriend . so cynthia , life couldn't better she wants share her happiness world ! " , nothing bad said article .. you tell , quite opposite . this way touch handles itself - it tells facts more happy things celebs lives less worse . but what i meant before it talks even no celeb issues this next story people news : * under survivors heading*montana plane crash miracle - man woman first presumed dead plane crash , but woman , jodee hogg managed free herself plane wreckage then free fellow parks co-work matthew ramige . they stayed anthor fellow passanger while he died then left get help walked two half miles - matthew broken back burns . it really amazing . kelly ripa advice working momsis joaquin still mourning his brother ? prince harry gets seriousmary kay defends her crimethere cover story . lo jennifer garner what . lo thinks " bennifer 2 " she still love ben . but even handled respectfully closest thing it gets sensationalizing it page entitled battle jens but it more fun than anything plainly obvious . here few more headings articles within mag - i think they pretty self explanatory so i'm just going list them : you friends your lover ex ? - three not crowd renee , jack his former wife , meg . fashion trauma - even celebs strike out , but these oops outfits saved ? why chip kim win $1 millionat home kelly osbourne - her pink paradisejerry favorite food stop - crossing jordan star jerry o'connel takes touch carney lathe 10 sexiest men season - it raining men this autumn , hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over big small screens . what makes them best ? she plus-size model proud ! - america next top model toccara happy just way she . fatherhood changed my life ! - mark wahlberg talks his journey crotch grabbing bad boy devoted dadis tyra next oprah ? several more . i especially like section : it true ? - real story behind hottest gossip . you read this know what told truth . i noticed way more celebrities open up allow touch interviews tell them first hand facts than * other * magazines . also featured this issue article kevin costner wedding reception fair last weeks focused more his wedding this one more reception . it featured different pics/angles than last week so it not recycled material . katie wedding dream finally coming true ? - now her boyfriend divorce final , america favorite sweetheart free tie knot she couldn't happier !

american girl magazine geared girls aged 7-13 . much younger than many girls aren't reading appropriate level yet . much older they may ready move . but honestly i'm surprised read so many reviews 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old this magazine . i don't believe girls age need magazines based solely makeup tricks , flirting boys , etc . ag articles such dealing relationships friends . like when you your best friend start grow apart . or when she moves away . articles like one girl whose family travels around world their sailboat two years . crafts you actually proud give age 10 . several reviewer complained magazine short expensive . it . but here why : there no advertising ( short anything american girl related ) . many magazines , advertising accounts easily half pages . advertising enables publishers sell magazines low cost . ag no advertising so charge fair price produce it . i'm more than willing pay kind publication . parents ordering your daughters , you know your girl . if you've got 10 year old going 16 , this may not your child . if you precocious 6 year old , she might like it well . ag kind magazine i'm glad my daughters enjoy	1

lot reviewers share similar views , seen recurrence similar criticism today magazines . what these complaints also common they tend fairly uninformed regard certain issues . first off , we all know t+l " affluent travelers . " read publisher description , it tell you just . so if you're not affluent traveler , then don't waste your money t+l stick budget travel . t+l occassionally " affordable " stories , especially their affordable issue march . but don't expect hotels under $200 night . you know why ? because nowadays under $200 night means you're step above youth hostal , especially europe where you pay extra 20% top every dollar today exchange rate . point t+l never positioned itself affordable travel mag , so criticize its shortcomings respect invalid complaint . anyone who claims photography blown out out focus hasn't picked up copy magazine since 1999 . furthermore , if all you saw straightforward photographs hotel rooms , you'd go out your mind boredom . there nothing wrong adding little art your photography , after all photography fact art , t+l pretty good job . so what if there beautiful woman photo . no one saying you look like her or promising she'll strewn across bed your hotel room . use your imagination - this travel photography travel + leisure magazine - it ain't newsweek . all other offensive problems media today , only america people complain too much skin . lastly , readers need understand magazines don't put more ads giggles . magazine business , ad revenue way magazine earns money . so more ads they , more profit they , more money they pay better photographers writers hire more staff more research , etc , etc , etc . no magazine going choose throw away money order not offend its readers fewer ad pages . fact , high ad content indication high circulation , which indication reader satisfaction . more people magazine reaches , more companies want advertise there . fact matter there no perfect travel magazine existence . they either too service heavy , or editorial fluff , or too scientific adventure-y , or just b-level publication . t+l its shortcomings , it its top whatever lists there lot high-end service there . but it stunning its share well written interesting articles	1

subscriber newsweek last 2 years , i'm happy endorse it . topics covered which interest me most involve national/world politics science ; however , i'm pleased discover other subjects covered i wouldn't typically seek out(entertainment , religion , etc . ) . i'm puzzled ranting other negative reviews . while it not perfect , i consider newsweek solid overall its coverage general interest	1
newsweek easy read interesting magazine . however , it not balanced economist or time magazine but come up some interesting articles developments worldwide . if you ignore conservative slant magazine , you enjoy coverage analysis various current world events . newsweek helps me keep up developments diverse range subjects including business society , international affairs , politics , arts other areas . i also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature . magazine helps put news into context . instance , i often frustrated during recent israeli-hezbollah conflict lebanon i could see news tv but not understand story behind news . however , after i read conflict newsweek , i got know background going back into decades i could now appreciate all news stories their proper context .	1

this one i subscribe , even though , strictly speaking , magazine better job covering contempo musica mondo . uncut those us who feel nostalgic popular music figures whose stuff held up over time . writing superior , vastly superiour anything print today . this because mag staffed geezers who cut their teeth writing likes nme probably something like top pops back day . writers veterans this good number reasons , among them they bring great perspective , journalistic professionalism , acute insights , otherwise forgotten trivia realization there more life than just listening tunes , i.e. there whole other culture happening simultaneously , their writing . actually , apart feature artist feature , this magazine more film , past present , i love this aspect it because editors choose actor , director , genre or actor/director focus oevre xhosen subject then just lay out whole wackawackapacka stuff you definitely going go out buy/ rent/ borrow view . i always find new movie i just got watch after reading my latest edition uncut . plus , each issue comes complimentary cd . selections these cd spotty i find poor ones i spin through just couple times , good ones , i keep play lots . you won't sorry you subscribed this mag but you likely sorry you didn't if you ever get chance see what you missed not doing so	1

okay , i've read other reviews call this publication shallow , lacking depth , geared toward young teenagers , etc . i guess if you looking twenty page , in-depth technical articles delve into every minute neutron particular subject , then yes , this publication might not what you're looking . but , if you're regular , average , ordinary guy like me ( who would not understand those deep , brainy articles anyway ) you looking entertaining , informative view onto what new what cool , i think you'll pleased . very pleased ! take , example , couple recent issues ( see date when this review written ) . last month focused future personal aviation people behind effort make personal flight more available affordable , aircrafts they inventing . fascinating ! now , i run out build myself prototype after reading articles ? ummm , no . i know whole lot more incredibly fun subject then i before ? yes ! this month issue focuses similar theme : future personal space travel idea space-hotel . when you're reading it you able build rocket fly moon ? course not . but it informative educational exact level i would want it ... just enough make me aware , enlightened , entertained . so all non-nerds , non-rocket scientists , non-brainiacs who want scientific publication people , people , i think your yearly subscription money well spent . enjoy	1

i picked up copy british vogue when i finished reading my american vogue month , interested british vogue its take fashion , plus i've subscriptions british magazines past impressed them . there many , many things set this magazine apart american vogue . first , this magazine main focus fashion . they devote more space models than celebrities , socialites , or noblility types . they don't only focus high unreachable fashions but also feature more affordable clothing ( granted , its mostly british stores , but thought counts ) . articles british vogue more educated , they cover more ground . thing i really liked this magazine not only shows fashions trends but also shows you how put them together , what mixes what , what you should looking getting . they also talk staple pieces this magazine , how where buy those . this magazine also pride country you don't see u.s. anymore which breath fresh air . snootiness american vogue , parading around couture only , $900 first night sets whatnot left out this magazine . it almost seems like this magazine more practical than its american counterpart . lastly , this magazine higher quality , full , glossy pages , glossy cover , overall 2 inches bigger all way around than its american counterpart . this magazine very , very good , i just wish subscription more affordable .	1
i reading history today years . it covers largely european , especially british , history , occasional articles american world history . articles written established scholars sound popular historians , such antonia fraser alison weir , accompanied brief bibliographies . illustrations usually drawn sources contemporary subject article . its only drawback americans price . however , after years freeloading libraries , i decided get subscription . believe me , it worth it .	1
new york review books , new yorker must weekly read me . i read it , cover cover except ads , 45 minutes hour each night before sleep . roger angell baseball best ; lane denby tag teamming movie reviews ; joan acocella dance ( dance ! i've read more it than i've ever seen ) , list goes . left wing ? several reviewers here said magazine left wing . this hilarious . obviously these people never read left wing maqgazine , such comments only illustrate extent which political spectrum us shifted rightward . left wing try : nation , progressive , dissent , or monthly review . new yorker middle brow bourgeois it gets	1
i subscribing new yorker five years now , it very enlightening experience . new yorker its part covering big news stories , but it not really news magazine . perspectives unique ( admittedly lean left ) , kind you're not likely get elsewhere . authors use first person because they tend part stories they're covering . take jon lee anderson , probably most credible reporter covering middle east today . his " letters " various cities involve accounts his meetings locals leaders . other segments more like npr stories -- unique perspectives largely uncovered topics aren't time-sensitive . you'll get in-depth looks into developments medicine , law , architecture , etc ., otherwise wouldn't get your radar unless you profession . , writers incorporate " larger questions " stories focused recent events . like malcolm gladwell recent account playwright who plagiarized material former article written him . he parlayed his personal struggle into good summary legal ethical positions use or development one person idea . i grown look forward reading fiction selection each week . sometimes i don't like piece , but i enjoy getting chance read writers i normally wouldn't those i normally would . additionally , magazine added more dedicated issues -- most recently " food " issue , addition standbys like " style " " fiction " issues . i loved " food " issue , especially one writer account search truly authentic pasta involved work night mario batali kitchen trip italy . i enjoy balance hard news , balanced interest stories , arts new yorker provides . i began my subscription get different perspective than what i got local southern news , i keep it same reasons many more	1

i subscribed multiple photography magazines first when i started getting serious photography . i subscribed ' photography ' ' american photo ' this one , popular photography imaging . three this magazine most balanced amount reviews , ' how tos ' , digital imaging related topics ( photoshop , etc ) well some nice contests . also they seem sponsor more ' mentor series ' type products where you go some locale shoot photos reasonable fee . all magazines this also something important me - half magazine isn't ads . photography worst offender this , there'd 50 or so pages weak articles , then 50 pages solid ads . while this one chunk ads near back , it still ' back page ' article articles mixed among ads . only 25% magazine advertisements . they also support nice online website ( popphoto.com ) forum where people logon ask questions . while not heavily trafficked say dpreview.com authors editors read respond questions . overall great magazine hobby	1

what positives one say ' national geographic ' magazine hasn't said already . ' ng ' american institution appeals individuals thirst multi-culturalism , science , sociology . photography stunning say least . it often said ' best education ' travel far wide see how other cultures live think . since this isn't practical many , next best thing read ' national geographic ' magazine ! addition , fairly recent cover article ' evolution ' well written , convincing , accurate ! myopic , ignorant reviewer below who thinks world revolves around her , who mentioned not into soccer , i say this her : most world loves soccer ( technically called football ) , all nfl , mlb , nba fans combined don't even come close combined numbers soccer fans worldwide ! i am subscriber life	1

i rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what i read other reviewers , most whom focused how ritzy lifestyles parents depicted articles , how " expensive " clothes , how pretty moms ( models ) , etc ... this magazine . don't we expect some kind facade ? other " parenting " magazines may appear more " real " parents , but this no more than their chosen tactic . any publication whose foundational goal sell more advertising , they wouldn't doing this unless they believed it going work . they selling certain " lifestyle " just like child magazine . if it more accordance yours , fine . but why trash just because it different ? child magazine isn't perfect . but least it doesn't pander . anyone really want see what target latest attempt toddler fashion when they open magazine ? i'd rather just check myself next time i'm out buying diapers . if you value solid writing above all else magazine , then child magazine you . ( whether you afford $90 pair toddler shorts page 28 won't such issue . )	1
when i considered subscribing ft last year , i slightly disappointed there wasn't any recent reviews it . so here we go ... i subscribe both wall st journal financial times ( ft ) , past subscribed economist . comparison sake , wsj very good its section one coverage , especially front page stories , political coverage , its excellent frequently quoted editorials . me , other stuff fluff . regarding economist , it highly touted weekly newsmagazine two downfalls ( reasons why i cancelled my subscription ) - it weekly (!) seems interject alot commentary into its stories . which leads us ft . ft , i feel like i'm reading news , more importantly , it daily format , ensuring you'll up date latest global news . there excellent coverage us happenings , europe asia . once you read it , you feel much better informed - where else you get daily extended coverage russian/ukraine natural gas issue or , several months ago , daily coverage germany elections ? excellent reporting comes great , although somewhat left/liberal commentary - don't let dissuade you , however . other gems include business reporting , including stories management ideas , business life , etc .... most excellent weekend edition ( saturday ) , full all sorts cultural stories , including food , wine , arts , book reviews , travel , like . not too mention awesome columns lucy kellaway , martin lukes , tyler brule . you must pick this up indulge yourself few weeks , if you undecided . you not disappointed . reading owning ft must .	1
i enjoyed this magazine kid , but then , i also loved electric company . looking both now , they seem dated tedious , but perhaps our children need something moves slower pace than everything seems now . neither my children ( 5 7 ) enjoyed highlights first , but after getting subscription their grandmother , they discovered joy curling up quiet corner figuring out puzzles stories themselves . it magazine style format encourages reflection absorption , rather than voracious grab go version reading , i believe give child better foundation .

i always avoided parenting magazines : their crowded covers life-or-death information , flash-in-the-pan expert pontificating ( pacifiers dangerous ! not using pacifiers dangerous ! ) , buzz-word-loaded headlines , frantic exclamation points , they unappealing me local evening news . inside those magazines just scattered hectic their covers , nanny , articles themselves , primarily life parent like getting your spouse help out , sex after kids , how get your groove back/feel hip , what toys buy your children next , etc , not really my niche anyway . i subscription martha stewart kids little while , because i liked project ideas ( though i always adapted them make them much less involved ) , but focus magazine become large , elaborate , professionally catered birthday parties , so i dropped i t.t hen , i came across wondertime . while other parenting magazines remind me parents swapping opinions , advice , gripes other parents , this more like what child would tell you if he could : example , what makes playroom truly functional child -an article which begins mother realizing her formal dining room waste space which i wish i could give every family i've ever worked . article " come play me " summer 2006 issue begins " grown-up mean you've outgrown child play ? c'mon , you know you it you . here some playful ideas outing your inner child . " it actually perspective how enjoy it -not tips how cope fact you find it mind-numbingly boring or must endure it necessary " quality time . " article " broom one own " talks how much children love included , helping , doing something themselves . toys mentioned here things like mirrors , sand , water , great outdoors ( sense advertisements here seem really out place ) . i also deeply appreciate magazine attitude towards children learning . other magazines , there abundance advice how ensure you stimulating your children much possible , how manipulate their play exploration , how make everything into language game , everything into quiz , everything into kind lesson which adult charge show puts child through his paces . this magazine , least now , takes approach learning happens . allow it happen allow yourself enjoy around it . i love . i can't wait see third issue	1

i use subscribe shape several years ago , then it packed full great work out routines , meal plans , etc women all levels fitness . well . . . my last few months shape complete disappointment . i found very few pages good genuine fitness healthy eating advice . instead , it ranks right up glamour category magazines highest percentage advertisements , nearly all excercise material supposed " quick fix " fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations , healthy eating advise absolutely elementary . there no substance here women like me , average working woman who desire live healthy life everyday limited time commit exercise . i want magazine inspiring focus living sustained healthy lifestyle , not joke getting flat abs week illustrations perfectly chiseled models who obviously not face body challenges average women . i'm sorry but most women not going look like " her " after two weeks , or many months shape 10-30 minute day routines , but they sure lead you beleive so . i highly recommend " her sports " it magazine women desiring live active , day-to-day healthy life	1

i found cat fancy magazine mostly advertisements breeders advertisements than real meat information cat owners . i'm also very unimpressed their cat channel online board they advertise cat fancy cannot recommend it others . they seem poor management their online board especially weekends so inappropriate posts stay there long time professional magazine advertising their own online board their magazine should their online board perfected before offering it . also cat fancy pushes ridiculous high renewal rate their magazine , but if you go onto amazon , you get renewal rate almost half cat fancy renewal price . so i come conclusion cat fancy magazine , their poor online cat channel board high renewal rate cat fancy charges , they not interested keeping their readers or online members .	-1

it beyond me why any pre-teen or teen would want read this kind magazine . i reading this magazine couple weeks ago ski trip because my 13-year old friend happens get it her mail . truth , this magazine lacks substance . i don't see why people even care what jojo friend thinks her celebrity , how mk recovering hospital anorexic or what jesse mccartney marital status . leave celebs alone ; let them live their life . i've seen same things printed this magazine over over . this magazine shallow downright materialistic ( i.e. some articles i seen various covers " get him anything you want ! " , " what jesse mccartney nickname ? " " terrified alone ? " ) . i don't like most magazines , but if you want mag real substance , look forth seventeen or cosmogirl ! magazine . preteens -- skip this magazine . editors write level 2nd graders understand . read anything but this -- your local newspaper , even national geographic ( one my favorites ) . this magazine $17 10 issues--don't you think that bit pricey ? if you're parent , please don't buy your daughter this mindless garbage . can't you find anything decent your kids read ?	-1

once thought women health magazine , cosmo taken twisted turn into pointless redundancy . one point , cosmo seemed must-have , water oxygen . more more lately , it seems magazine posing question " how we survive only water oxygen , still sexy while we ? " ocassionally , featured article faces issues things ranging eating disorders politics , but few far . they don't seem realize other side page eating disorder article , woman who wears size 0 still unsatisfied herself , thinking she must conform some " heroin-chic " fad . fun fearless female - articles real women who make real difference - great . it shines spotlight someone who not only beautiful successful , but enough education talent succeed world , without needing man . if magazine featured more these things , maybe it would worth my subscription fee . but tell me when last time you saw cover not featuring phrases " mind-blowing sex " , " how satisfy ( insert breathing life form here ) " , or " barely-there " , which seems refer not just underwear anymore , but everything . this isn't magazine women health anymore . it all how keep your man happy , while still conforming social standards fashion , weight , financial standings . i'm sorry , but " girl budget " can't afford $430 skirt , or uncomfortable shoes uncomfortable price $300+ . cater more real woman ; not one who only cares her relationship status , pant size , bank account	1

my only gripe this magazine pictures like those you would find gq magazine : they hire models show you driving nail or shoveling dirt new patio . these people use only brand new tools ( brand name label showing course ) perfect-world dust free environment . pictures make it look like it sears catalogue . aside , articles great making it one best magazines do-it-yourselfer . i saved more money tips this magazine than any other magazine i subscribe . most articles any semi-skilled craftsman access decent set tools , making it approachable magazine diy'er . i highly recedommend this magazine conjunction fine homebuilding magazine . magazine you find pictures real people operating used tools real environment . articles handyman bit more down-to-earth , but together you get most benefit	1
... while , yes , i've made comments past how oprah changed little , this publication . i'm sure person who wrote " this just magazine full things one can't afford " reads fashion or celebrity magazines full many things she can't afford . advertising generates money , while i don't like ads either , they everywhere because advertising works . if you don't want see them , don't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . far layouts " too full clutter " ... everyone their own style . there some people who like look don't prefer pared-down , zen look . magazines not reality . if they , they wouldn't plastered plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i'm originally middle america , nobody looks like there . just take magazines ads what they . save your money , like i , things you just . if you don't perserverence , then stick target walmart circulars . knock-offs never far behind .	1

this might sound strange first , but i confess : course i subscribe gramophone its critically perceptive unfailingly well-written reviews features , but perhaps what i love best this magazine copious informative record-label advertisements ! just leafing through nov . or dec . 2004 edition , i see full-page even two-page spreads showing : * all lastest issues gramophone awards series -- series mid-priced reissues universal ( philips , decca , dg ) recordings won gramophone award . * all latest issues rosette collection , series mid-priced reissues universal recordings awarded rosette penguin guide . * all latest releases hyperion , dg , sony , rca , philips , emi , virgin , naxos , naive , classics pleasure , bis , chandos , cpo , mdg , etc . etc . etc . other words , if you're fairly assiduous collector trying stay abreast all latest recordings , you find gramophone invaluable indeed unsurpassed this respect -- both new releases reissues . ads not only give you catalog numbers release dates ; they also inform you which recordings won which awards garnered accolades which critics . browsing ads gramophone every month * * best way see all new releases -- not even most well-stocked classical-specialist cd shop would carry all these titles . what more , many many desirable classical cds * never * issued domestically north america , so how else you going find out what available europe ? furthermore , every issue contains 4- or 5-page section called " new releases , " which lists very specific product info every cd issued month over 100 record labels (!!) -- that no exaggeration because i actually counted them . new developments i've noticed since gramophone significant makeover nov 2004 issue : gone robert layton ( bbc music magazine ) , apparently traded jeremy nicholas ( bbc music magazine ) -- these new developments , aren't they ? so it no longer true say all three penguin editors write gramophone : layton gone , now only greenfield march . ( i take this opportunity say i still miss baroque critic nonpareil nicholas anderson . his moving gramophone bbc music magazine reason i started reading mag first place . ) finally , way rebutting previous reviews this page : you see above list record labels advertise gramophone , it no longer true ( if indeed it ever ) magazine kowtows " major " labels . fact , gramophone critics recommend many or more recordings such " indie " labels naive , harmonia mundi , hyperion , chandos , mdg , cpo , capriccio , glossa , linn , avie , lso live , telarc , etc . etc . they " major " labels : sony , rca , warner , universal . it certainly * not * true next quality recording more likely emerge mp3 file russia than new release " major " record company -- reason this simple : record labels -- all them , including indies -- today greatest artists under exclusive recording contracts . until likes vengerov , perahia , manze , biondi , minkowski , harnoncourt , jacobs , hundred others free agents making their own recordings , record labels remain relevant -- nay , indispensable -- ever . you won't find vpo , bpo , lahti so , or concertgebouw popping up obscure mp3 file either ! therefore , gramophone " business model " -- earning revenue record-label advertising -- hardly obsolete . quite contrary , moreover gramophone quick embrace " indie " labels such harmonia mundi ( mag " label year " last year ) ventures such lso sfo issuing their own in-house recordings . fact , reviewer below who predicts imminent demise gramophone ( extension all classical mags , including fanfare , diapason , bbc music magazine ) sounds much like gramophone-resenters classicstoday.com, who making same claims quite some time . such resenters their ilk apparently never learned this simple lesson : you cannot build yourself up simply tearing others down . ( attention classicstoday.com: want earn some critical clout ? then learn write , crying out loud ... take hurwitz , example , who routinely exclaims : " this best recording or , period . " period ? this supposed enlighten persuade me ? but pardon me , i rant digress . ) finally , even if we assume sake argument gramophone fanfare offer reader equal amount equally well-written reviews -- i'm really not convinced this true -- but assuming this so , i give nod gramophone all above reasons . fanfare doesn't offer superabundance information copious amount new releases reissues , therefore isn't useful tool staying current * all * new releases . i must admit -- call me superficial if you , but i must admit fanfare lack production values makes it relatively unappealing . fact , based its appearance feel , it reminds me slightly larger-sized version reader digest . i freely admit i love tactile visual qualities gramophone -- large glossy pages photos graphics ads all make very pleasurable perusal . contrast , fanfare seem like underground newsletter . i believe more than one critical perspective good thing , while i would certainly not discourage anyone subscribing fanfare , i still think gramophone obvious first choice	1

my head pulsates useless music trivia knowledge , most it reading magazines like " mojo . " let face it - brits market cornered quality music-centric publications right now this one , " classic rock , " " , " , occasionally , " uncut , " - but " mojo " editors need get over their obsessive compulsive infatuation beatles bob dylan , both whom influence importance grand scheme rock roll lore grossly overrated . live it ( let hate mail start rolling) ! minor caveat out way , " mojo " writing essence drive , simplicity , reverence its subject matter ( two words - ben edmonds ) , no small feat . their feature articles loaded facts information even i've never read before layout spot-on brilliant . how this innovation ? reviews section skimps neither quantity nor quality . while i can't pretend automatically snap up each issue " mojo " like i " classic rock , " i'm usually latest issue my newstand like dirt dog , evidenced stack back issues casa paull which now towers above all three my kids . if all this isn't enough , most issues come free sampler cd tunes least marginally related cover story - that called " gravy .

this magazine devoted american inventions technology affected our lives . essence , this magazine historical magazine american technology . within each issue multiple articles historical invention . articles either focus technology or focus individual who key contributor advancement technology . typically , each issue also interview inventor or inventors whose contributions materially affected our lives or society . scope magazine broad . there articles trans-canada highway . recent issue excellent article tunnel boring machines . yet article development refinery cracking described context development higher performance engines . contribution high octane gasoline winning air war mentioned , interesting piece trivia which i previously unaware . scope magazine beyond physical sciences . biology development medical technology also covered . while magazine written level educated non-expert understand , some biology related articles challenge my attention . this magazine excellent source technological history . however , while technical jargon used appropriate technology , this magazine not light reading those unfamiliar specific field . example , i read portions article refinery cracking couple times understand general description how cracking process works . therefore , while i highly recommend this magazine anyone interest history technology , realize some readers , example elementary school students , this magazine could present reading challenge . most articles also provide pictures or other artwork . frequently this artwork unavailable any other magazine source because there so few magazines deal technological history . quality images varies because many pictures not well-preserved , but many cases they only pictures available . this magazine frequently mentions inventor hall fame akron , ohio , which sponsored united states patent trademark office . number articles covered inductees inventor hall fame , showing while articles historical nature , they also currently relevan t.t here large number magazines either technology , or articles technology . there large number trade magazines cover technology . sometimes these magazines even articles history invention . however , " american heritage invention technology " only magazine which i am aware covers history invention technology . while focus articles american technology , it inevitable relationship foreign invention covered occasionally well when technology important development american technology . i consider this magazine excellent anyone interest historical technology , excellent complement other historical magazines .	1

you've got take your hat off fangoria . whether their style gory , visceral coverage horror genre appeals you or not you can't deny their success . fact they've doing it 20 years really marvel world magazines , let alone genre magazines . fangoria still tops terms their production values photography although newer mags like rue morgue some imports certainly good . fangoria each month checks very large array reviews both current releases older releases you may missed . since many these films go direct video , chances you probably miss them . besides movies they also cover horror fiction non-fiction , tv even smattering music where appropriate . if there minor complaint fangoria it sometimes they come off bit fannish perhaps not critical movies they should . honestly i've watched movies they've given favorable reviews wondered just what heck they smoking when they watched . other complaint would they devote almost no space classic horror , but that just pet peeve	1

( 2 ) " he sponsored legislation help telecommunications companies buy up public airwaves . " ( 3 ) he thinks " we should all `smart cards ' - electronic ids our health history encoded them . " ( 4 ) he " voted every free trade pact come his way senate since cold war .
