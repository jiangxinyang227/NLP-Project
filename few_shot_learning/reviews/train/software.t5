easy language 16 only useful if you're already familiar language you wish learn . i've studying french months before buying this product found it helpful when i'm getting rusty . only problem it hard make out what said because sound not clear . recorded speakers also don't bother slow down give you chance understand or repeat what said . this good cause it like listening actual french speaker not robot , bad if you actually want learn how pronounce what said . it also go over basic french grammar but totally useless if you don't already know basic french grammar . i also tried use this learn japanese . unlike french , i'm not familiar japanese language all so trying use this product learn it became nightmare . if all you want learn how speak language it romanized version words phrases make it easier sound them out . unfortunately basic japanese grammar japanese alphabet all written japanese . instance , grammar section it past , present future " i am " it written english then beside it it written japanese . you can't click them it sound out you . japanese alphabet section all it japanese alphabet you click them sound them out but you really no clue what you sounding out . so it teaches you nothing reading language but test they want you take purely japanese . i want learn how read , write speak japanese so none this would problem if it actually taught you how read , write , speak japanese ! so my guess would you really familiar japanese ( not romanized(romanjj ) version ) already order use this product . because my experiences this product i would say get it only if you know languages you're interested use it refresher nothing more . since i am familiar french this product pretty helpful but if i used this starter language i probably would quit . i'm searching amazon better japanese books . so if you want actually learn language look books language tapes cd 	-1

this program average below average it abilities . said , just hope you don't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or email help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [ web-based support ] system traps you endless loop . i needed couple simples updates pc not allowed internet . it used you could download roxio patches any pc internet access . then burn patch[s ] cd , or copy floppy/jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " patches pc needing them . no more . what happened today their webpage apparently trying download/patch roxio product directly my pc . [ ezcd5 doesn't exist my pc ] . instead simply letting me download it somewhere , like my hard drive , vs patchging it directly their webpage my pc , [ which won't work my case i'm not using roxio , nor it installed my pc ]; apparently morons roxio webpage coding make download/patch process stop/end proceed send customer back roxio initial patch download page . when you need patch , all these endless loops support gamesare enough get me looking different product/different company . if you want minimize human contact customers , fine . but let folks least download patches they need order keep their pc going . don't hand over your customer support system [ almost ] completely web server . ignorant arrangement works well when companies try save few pennies get rid phone receptionists customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through 100 layer deep voicemail system find answer simple problem . it just doesn't work . if company won't provide access patches , even after i logged into their website username password , [ so they know accessing their patches ] they don't offer any type ftp site download backup option , then i sure heck won't buying anymore their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat other companies . [ though i hate see such quality companies devoured like ] . when competitor better product , why fight improve your prodsuct quality/features , when you buy other company out . thank goodness nero not under roxio umbrella .	-1

i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts . it says so box , but it doesn't . it works just like old contacts which you can't share others except if you export it . no live sharing . why couldn't they make it so i could put file my server ? or secure site ? then all my office work off one contact list . 50% or more time business contacts can't found when you search contact . it like business contacts add doesn't work outlook . or you add contacts , save it , email saved email address then go find contact later it gone . also , lots times when you try send , email won't send , it stays outbox . repeatedly you open hit send button but it won't change send status . now , if you leave it outbox , sometimes fools program into letting you send other email . or sometimes you forward send .. geez , what waste money this upgrade . we won't using it any our other computers we haven't bought if new computers we ordered .	-1

office 97 pretty good product . programs powerful , decent interface ( maybe not good claris products early 1990s , but not bad ) , came ton features all one disc . office 98 release mac pretty much same thing . only thing really got annoying me office assistant ( paperclip ) but it easy enough turn off . office 2000 bit disappointment me . i felt improvements minimal ( aside bit more stability word -- anyone who ever used word 97 regular basis knows it prone crashing ) fact detracted ease use . one example clip gallery , which went one best organizers ever created becoming program wouldn't received decent reviews 1988 . powerpoint outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space therefore made actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often this problem . menus , which hide some functions until you go bottom them , also annoyance . manual went nice thick book one half size . office 2003 continues making program uglier . now there many tasks crammed onto one little panel right screen . again , this eats into workspace . clip art system even more cumbersome , many clips online only now . help feature tries point too much online direction well . now some people may not complain , but what if you're using laptop middle country ? i feel program basically uglier version same thing first seen 1997 . fact , 1997 version more pleasant work almost powerful . my macs , i've switched keynote presentations pages some my word processing because new office versions platform similar . some templates also look very 1997 . apple programs updated regular basis , their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now then , but they should consider redesigning many them -- such replacing overused arial times new roman fonts something little more classy . program bloated way too heavily . i run office 2000 comfortably 486 sub-1gb hard drive , but can't even get 2003 it . final gripe access not user friendly all . file maker better alternative , it easier use friendlier	-1
while microsoft tries very hard make office " think ahead me , " they almost always seem get it wrong . result package consistently annoys me . it true one turn off " helpful " hints otherwise customize programs so they less hindering , however bloated package nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody business . my opinion , office ' 97 excellent package , versions since then gone steadily downhill . many people , i use office work because i no choice . home i've good luck staroffice sun . while not perfect , staroffice read created files compatible microsoft office very consistently my experience , it whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 anyone except those who need most advanced functions excel and/or need use access database frequently .	-1

i bought software ( digital image suite 2006 ) before i bought my camera - ready process pictures i going take . big mistake . i bought canon 30d camera record my images raw format (* . cr2 ) . unfortunately , not all canon . cr2 raw files same . so , even though software says you edit . cr2 raw images , it depends which camera made image . here complaint number two -if you use microsoft customer service/technical support you routed india - they just give you answer vaguely related your problem . after emailing several times getting nowhere you find out you can't write their washington state headquarters unless you name someone address . so , basically , microsoft largest technical software company world worst customer service no american technical support . now , final complaint . there no link or method get updates or upgrades this program ! so , if i want use microsoft software package edit my photo images then i buy new software package - isn't wonderful .	-1

feeling more than bit fleeced mcafee overpriced " subscription " renewal every year , i decided give kaspersky try . installation went smoothly everything seemed fine 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot --- just stalled blank screen right after windows xp splash screen . when trying boot up safe mode , list drivers currently loading scrolled down screen . it stopped file called kl1 . sys hung there forever . little research work showed this kaspersky file . it may just coincidence my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts use recovery disk failed . trip local computer shop revealed data my hard drives ( which inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not recovered ( unless i wanted ship them recovery shop , nothing them worth much ) . so they're going reinstall windows , i'll reinstall shipload software when i finally get my computer back , , yes , i'll lose all data there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all kids ' photos --- well , most them . thanks , kaspersky ! )anyway , perhaps my attempts recovering os caused worst this . whatever case , i believe boot failure caused either kaspersky file corrupted or virus . who knows . kaspersky blame both scenarios . i know one thing : i am not going tempt fate loading this program my computer again . kaspersky yet respond my e-mail . i got automated " we received your e-mail " response , but nothing more , even though they state they usually respond within day or two . over week ago . if fact their software no way responsible my computer flaking out me , then i still not apologize one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i'm insane or this just fluke , least yourself favor make decent boot disk yourself before installing this product . might mean difference losing data/spending $$$ just inconvenienced . don't expect much assistance kaspersky should things go wrong .	-1

after years e-filing fees included purchase price , it would more forthcoming turbotax put large sticker front their box alerting buyers price they pay e-filing each return . i lost value my entire state return - then some - through e-filing fees : $44.95 ( plus tax ) program , $16.95 ( plus tax ) each return e-filed ( i filed two ) little bonus fee company handles [ credit card ] transaction ( fee never quoted program i wait my credit card statement find out what ) . addition , anyone who chooses fees deducted his/her refund pay additional $30 . product what it says . but , cost , less-than-honest way which change occured ( it almost seemed deceitful - hence single star rating ) , i would preferred given my money my friendly neighborhood accountant . people expect change , even if they don't like it . but , suprises cost customers money never welcome drive customers away . surely marketing/advertising gurus think way alert customer significant change such this even put " positive " spin it .

many repetitions necessary order acquire second language or third , but monotony this program not keep your interest long , so boring offers not variety all . this program take away excitement learning language even most motivated individuals , not help acquire fluency because it not equip you tools construct language your own . it not contain essential grammar instruction , it error suppose same grammatical rules your language applied other languages ( french not translation english , or spanish , or any other language ) . grammar becomes essential especially when you trying construct correct structures your own ; this program claims help you learn " naturally " but leaves huge gaps neglecting grammar , culture , conversational structures , clear understanding , not natural ! adults translation necessary when trying internalize concepts , adults already understanding language equipped learn differently than children , sometimes even faster . i not believe " learning second language like child " accurate statement describe this program , children immersed culture , everything around them " real deal " , not repetitious pictures recordings . children receive verbal non-verbal input constantly , adults greater cognition than children . looking picture while you listen recoding might give you vague idea what it means , but there not accuracy . it very unlikely you internalize concept you not fully understand . rosetta stone approach might very effective when memorizing vocabulary simple sentences , but i could achieve same purchasing flash cards fraction cost this overrated , overpriced program .	-1

i little research after trying install this product found symantec no longer rated very well anti virus . one site states this consumer reports ( they towards bottom ratings ) . it become major bloatware its stability isn't what it used . maybe this why peter norton sold his interests bailed out . i am far novice , but this thing gave me fight whole way . so my saga . first , this product supposed windows xp 2000 pro . even box says this . but when i insert cd w2k pro machine all i got error box showing error icon ok button . real informative . going through back door i try install without going through cd autostart program . now i get box says it requires xp 32 bit . so leaves out 2 machines i bought this . so i go machine running xp . first one loads ok , but it says it incompatible my firewall ( zonealarm ) which i happen trust lot . then second machine it goes through install ( which takes 45 min ) then runs autoupdate hangs halfway through . i finally abort it after it sat there hour ( i hoping it just slow moment ) . rebooted program no longer running . starting it up myself resulted it failing load . now i'm stuck , it won't allow me uninstall nor reload it again . obtain removal tool their web site it promptly removed every symantec product machine . maybe this writing wall ? now i'm couple days into drama . meanwhile , first xp machine loaded fine automatic update guess what . it locked up half way through . now it not run removed same way . so i am now proud owner zonealarm internet suite . it cost less than nav ( both 5 user versions ) , loaded much faster . ten minutes i , where it hour into nav when things worked it loaded . i am taking this up symantec trying get refund . they keep it . i've less satisfied every upgrade this one finally broke camel back . maybe i'll try again someday if i come up new camel , but they don't grow well seattle . added 3-12-2007 : i also noted after removing nav things i could not explain before cured . instance , web site [ ... ] would not load many it pages correctly , they would show text coding instead html . now i am nav free , all pages this site load no problems . hmmmm ..	-1
i've tried loyal quickbooks pro user 5 years now first this company provided competent accounting product decent after you learned its idiosyncracies . but each year you forced update ($$$) or your tax tables not accurate , each year some capabilities lost you pay them restored ($$$) , each year program more expensive update ($$$) . i am not unreasonable business owner i don't mind paying good service , but intuit turned into unethical , money grubbing monster . they sunset disable your software every time you download update , forcing updates buying previously provided services ( payroll tax tables , e-mailing invoices , printing 1099 w2 ) . this especially true year end , becuase they know they you tax/year end crunch . now they even doing unauthorised billing new services ( last year they started charging quarterly fees tax tables -- this year they charge mandatoy $300 payroll update well $100 software update program itself . ) furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under ruberic its same quarterly tax table fee . honestly , consider some other program ! this deceptive practice software disabling data blocking , combined dubious practice sunsetting software every year grown intolerable . i hope they get class action suit they deserve .	-1

i owned spysweeper several years . i found large amount spyware not getting caught . many cases , ** portion ** spyware caught , spy sweeper not remove complete spywhere i kept getting hits . tried out xoftspy software it found removed all spyware . even more , i get constant e-mails webroot telling me my " subscription needs renewed . " i must send $25 renew . i got caught their scam once until i started checking my subsciption date . they frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions up even though they may much year left . i contacted them several times this issue no response or correction . i am only keeping this software installed because i paid out bucks it . i would not recommend it others mainly because decptive business practices inability perform advertized . look elswhere	-1

i purchased this program recently , very disappointed . maps very limited ... example , most major tourist areas ( beaches , newport , ect . ) rhode island cut out ri map . i recommend buying ms streets trips 2005 ( which includes pocket streets 2005 box ) instead : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0002doeam/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654?v=glances=pcn=507846with this program , you entire usa your disposal , you select which maps send your pocket pc or smartphone . fortunatly , store sold me pocket streets allowed me exchange it streets trips ( after paying difference ) . prices very close .	-1

i'd give this product zero stars if i could . i use quickbooks online payment service version 2004 , last week it started telling me they discontinuing support version 2004 online service , so they forced me upgrade . so i bought upgrade , when i ran installer it wouldn't accept my serial number . i spent forty minutes phone tech support choppy line india , he still couldn't get it work . i finally gave up when next step he proposed disable all services running my computer . i heard others , including accountant , this version bad but couldn't believe it would really this bad . i'd used qb since early-1990s never really problem . but this really , really bad . intuit needs go back drawing board this version . it total lemon	-1
contrary advertising runs vista , what comes box may not run vista . upgrade now says you up date but it not ., however , you use product id download real vista version . beware product license says " software ... provided basis without warranty any kind ... " i major mess nuance product verification process . when product start run , it not correct . date i've charged two support incidents(maybe more billing hit my credit card later ) i've logged 3 hours phone within first two weeks well several emails . otherwise i like product but one should not hours grief pay pay get it running first time . i'll never nuance product .	-1

this maybe worst interface i ever displeasure working includes console applications dos interfaces . edlin fdisk more user friendly than mcafee security center . there noway disable software except uninstalling program or opening xp admin tools then forcing services stop , which not recommenable approach average user . here short list probelms i encountered . counter spy cheaper , easier use interface user friendly ! * cannot select disable during non-internet use so i run software security center conflicts like protools 7.3 recording software . * scan results vague , ie returns 6 quarantined threats but doesn't display what threats you can't print result either . * there more ...... there some good features but detractors win land slide .	-1
everyone else said , this product not all what it should . it slows down internet browsing crawl ( my laptop crashed several times , several years older runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer mcafee ) . you can't close it , others said , other than uninstalling . funniest part i've found , however , it warns you first time it tries access . amused , i refused program permission update itself . other than removing program , it best thing i using mcafee	-1

adobe audition my favorite program . i use it more than any other program i my computer . i used it restore thousands old phonograph discs . i am only giving them one star because i can't give them no stars this joke . i knew this going happen . i using cool edit pro long time when adobe bought it i knew they going turn it into adobe product screw it all up . i am very fortunate i went adobes web site downloaded free trail version . i would really upset if i actually paid money this dog . lets start boot up time . i own 2 year old average laptop audition 1.5 used boot 2 seconds . 2.0 takes 20 seconds . almost long photoshop or premiere pro . next we user interface . they destroyed it . old one worked so well . adobe really hung up making absolutely everything " palette " so now every little thing palette , allowing you resize relocate them your hearts desire . but after half hour trying i'll darned if i could not make 2.0 interface remotely resemble 1.5 interface . shortcuts buttons removed ( wow makes lot sense ) , however you get it back if you look long enough place it . ( don't bother right-click anything , their imperial wisdom right-clicking now pretty useless . ) but if you put shortcuts back up they now all black white it really difficult find one you want . place shortcuts they added some icons i yet figure out or need . what they thinking ???? lot presets reconfigured trying figure them out gave me headache . after several hours playing this pile garbage i decided uninstall it return using 1.5 .	-1
this program terrible deal . i run small business bought quickbooks simple start . once loaded you go use program there pop up requiring you administrator . when loading software it not tell you select or bypass administrator requirement . you only learn this when you first go use program . url they give pop up troubleshooting not address this issue , either . you just locked out program . now it gets fun . so , you speak them help . but this where it gets no laughing matter . get help you email them ask help . they then call you back their convenience . if you busy working when they call back you start all over . i yet able use this product since i bought it 3 weeks ago because they not call back when it convenient me customer not let me call my covenience . even worse , since they bought out all their competitors quickbooks customer support no longer available after regular hours when small business owner time handle such operations issues . i can't return this product refund because i loaded it . my first clue how not user friendly this product should title : simple start	-1

if you not mediocre-level understanding chinese , stay away this product . rosetta stone very unique approach might work children under age seven ( critical language learning years ) , but every other beginner language software almost impossible use . object " game " match mandarin phrase ( said aloud written pinyin ) poor , pixellated photo . example , first section first lesson , you shown ball , airplane , elephant horse . phrase read you match it correct photo . it gets much too complicated after . basically , it pure guessing game most time . i gave this product serious evaluation even after reading plethora poor reviews . i thought unique style interesting enough give chance , but i feel though i wasted hours hours . i remember only two or three words entire experience . although i spent fewer hours pimsleur mandarin audio lessons , i am able recall many , many more words phrases . although pimsleur isn't perfect , it definitely best choice beginner ( solid chinese-english dictionary ) . if you not know well basics mandarin , this software completely useless . buy pimsleur instead	-1
their approach might work other languages , but chinese it critically important understand grammar language , which rosetta stone never explains . it simply displays four pictures you , some incomprehensible ( beginner ) chinese near them , you learn match incomprehensible words pictures . i've taken chinese two years , i still found it impossible learn anything it . i either knew words already , or i couldn't learn whatever it they trying teach . i would happy just videotaped lecture mandarin college course , but i can't find anything like this sale or free online	-1

i specifically bought turbo tax premier because stocks sales/purchases we made 2006 . section stock income confusing it took me several times figure out what information turbo tax wanted where . when i thought i it figured out finished section , i thought i would repeat it make sure i it right . my surprise , second time i entered information i received different total than first time . so i it third time . third time matched second , so i figured it must right . then when i got section error checking , i told i errors my stock sales . so i it forth time , which came out same second third time . this time it passed error checking , but instead showing we purchased stocks , turbo tax showed we " inherited " stocks . i could not get turbo tax change , so i printed out form scratched out " inherited " put date purchase . i would rather my taxes hand than use turbo tax again	-1
normally i might wait install new software upgrade , but i just got new laptop thought it would best use office 2007 new vista operating system . i wrong . you would expect multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out powerful bug-free piece software . but after month using office 2007 , you get distinct impression this software not ready public release . microsoft should ashamed . i don't know root cause my problems , but i stress i am running clean install office 2007 vista , so there shouldn't any software conflicts or issues . so what my issues ? list long : -- my biggest concern ms word constantly hangs stalls . it making editing document very painful . i suspect problem when i put images or visio diagrams into document . but something old ms word able without issue . oddly , if i colleague open document save it out word 2003 , problem goes away ! what ?! it killing my productivity . -- when ever i cut paste old document , word hangs 15 20 seconds . often formatting margins my new document go haywire . i keep spend ton time fixing things . this never happened old word . this time killer . -- every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me it cannot display my email folders . uh oh ! i completely restart my computer see my email again . -- outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails people send -- they look like mess . it because outlook 2007 not render html correctly since it uses word engine , not internet explorer display email . i no idea why microsoft this , but they got fix it . -- many issues old word 2003 still haven't fixed . if you place image , it often hard get it appear correctly . why can't they solve this one ? -- while most office programs new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 not . so you remember how use two interfaces . couldn't microsoft find time money update all its programs ? give me break . -- few occassions visio 2007 , my files failed save correctly . first i thought this must my fault , but it happened me few times can't coincidence . few times i've gotten error message lost my work . ug . -- word excel 2007 use completely new file format . so anyone you send document 2007 installed ( which isn't likely case ) . get around this , you save it down 2003 file format , but then you end up two files your hard drive -- one new format one old format . what pain ! also , there definitely seems issue office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could cause many my problems , but there no way i avoid using old files . they should worked harder compatibility . there good things new 2007 . i like new interface design new features outlook 2007 amazing organizing tasks sharing your calendar . but i don't think it fair microsoft released product so full serious , serious bugs cost me hours hours extra work . i didn't spend hundreds dollars beta product don't think public should suffer . surely they afford better ! new addition my review : today i discovered i no longer paste excel charts into word like i used . when i try , chart goes , but any bars/lines disappear .	-1
i so excited get this ! terrain our lot quite slant it because we're hill . my husband i thought this would easily help us create materials list our retaining walls we wanted put out front . long story short ... i spent hours ( least 40 ) getting dimensions our house correct trying get yard right . we even rented surveying instrument determine slope our yard input elevation points . many hours wasted ... software not let you set height retaining walls it inputs random walls pieces wall 3-d view you can't get rid . flowers hard place , they don't end up where you want them . besides , " plant chooser " doesn't hardly any perrenial plants choose . bottom line : i spent $50 software costs $50 surveying instrument ended up calculate wall length height manually . if you flat lot , this might work well you . anyone hills , or slopes their yard , good luck !	-1

i imported quicken mac quickbooks pro mac after 3 weeks trying make result work , i gave up . interface far less intuitive than quicken ( example , entering vendor names typing first letters then scrolling through choices arrow keys ) not work qb , forcing one guess exact vendor name first time ; imported names addresses not go automatically vendors if they paid , customers if they provide payments ; rather they all go ' other names ' list , thousand or two names it , cannot simply dragged correct list ; rather each one edited individually . when i started forming invoices quotes customers , i found qb would forget customer address , sometimes including it other times yielding blank field . also field lengths qb often shorter than , resulting incomplete import memo fields . addition , export capabilities negligible ; one only export transactions other details proprietary format can't used elsewhere , unlike which exports readable massageable format . overall it seems qb written different company than , large extent programs not compatible even though import qb appears first viewing work ok . it better start new financial year new software enter all data again hand rather than try make qb use data , my view . i switched myob accountedge rather higher cost , find this clean start financial year beginning works ok me . myob product little clunkier than qb more fields fill numbered accounts all over place , its import total joke ( repeated questions where allocate accounts each transaction without explanation screen ) so import any more than 10 transactions becomes laughable ) but its export abilities wonderful i think its inventory control better than qb ; also , it not yet lost invoice addresses way qb me . one input addresses fields before memorizing tranactions however otherwise memorized transactions myob don't update . i found myob intuitive when it comes entry payee fields etc ; while qb lost data entry ease entirely . qb may advantage if your goal includes payroll however ; myob seems pretty sad service unless you prepared pay all taxes yourself .	-1

they changed pretty much everything . starters they completely removed all normal menus such file , tool , edit . which means you can't use keyboard quick easy menu access . well maybe you , but you would memorize all commands instead nice little visual cues which made previous versions office ( almost all other pc programs ) so much easier use . you basically use mouse everything . my experience there no faster way repetitive stress injury than over-mousing . ribbon just awful . first all it huge . it takes up four times space my customized toolbar . they place nearly every button imaginable it . far i tell you can't change it around or simplify it . every function displayed all time whether you need it or not . which makes finding anything real pain neck . you make ribbon retract which first glance seems nice . but reality it turns what used simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations ( extend ribbon , spend several minutes searching button , click button , retract ribbon ) . good grief ! what pain . this software didn't last 24 hours my system before i restored my old version office . this new interface most awful thing i've ever seen computer . i know certain free open source office suites i prefer this monstrosity . said i still prefer any all previous versions ms office free one . fact i would rather using my old wordperfect 1995 than this * thing * ms trying shove down our throats . if only i hadn't thrown disc away six years ago ... before you " invest " your money this software i strongly recommend you download free trial version . then buy earlier version	-1

quicken software continues contain prominent advertising intuit products services . my opinion , it fine offer additional services customers , but give customer opportunity say " no thanks " then leave them alone so they productive software . forever pestering paid customer advertising same products services not good idea . advertising takes up space user interface distraction reduces productivity	-1

i this program 30-day demo . it might ok if i didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable . i tried run system virus scan , recommended , but after 3 hours it only 2% because it stuck file it couldn't seem get past . i skipped file , but then it quickly got stuck again . " time remaining " said it would take 4 days complete , so i cancelled scan . it learning mode initally blocks everything . apparently , this program no brain . example , i live search toolbar installed outlook . it ask me if it ok run dll file . fact , each program called up process shared dll ask permission before it could run . don't even get me started quickbooks internet explorer problems . which what it wouldn't let those programs , even after they run i repeated clicked " allow " over over . twice today it got so slow running ie it finally crashed computer so bad i hard re-boot . if you it checking ports your computer , almost nothing would run or download ie . so , i'm going demo few more , but it probably back windows live onecare , which i past year . it just doesn't seem much ( no long list features ) , but it also doesn't jam everthing else up	-1

im going rate this product 2 because i like it but i would change few things if i could . it show you lot chords how play properly all good stuff . couple things i would change fact when they teaching you chord , you play program but its only 15 seconds , then you stop click play again . i wish there option where you could choose repeat it its own few times so you dont stop every time play it again . other thing something little more important . product program where you could go online down load lot songs play , its called olga . well this website legal problems not online anymore . so you dont option learning play your favorite songs beetles or metalica or grateful dead or anyone else , thats what they advertise " play hit songs " . so overall , knowing all this i would shopped around more . especially price , its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get little 15 second examples jingle bells little traditional folk songs .	-1

not buy this . go mac os 4.2 tiger , it doesn't crash or lock up . plus you get access really cool applications out box lets you almost anything media-wise . i could go one hours how macintosh operating system better but i say one last thing ... tiger faster than windows . research proved tiger all other operating systems conserve cpu performance such extent 90%-100% speed left applications such . windows eats up so much speed dos 20%-30% performance left user . puts normal windows computer ( 3ghz ) less than 1ghz . while normal mac computer ( 2ghz ) runs 2ghz . plus fastest mac dual g5 each running 2.7 ghz . so actual speed 5.4 ghz . fastest windows computer around 3.6 ghz which runs around 1ghz . huge difference ( 5.4 ghz-1ghz . ) when apple moves intel chips next year ( , ) macs run around 6.4 ghz if not more . even more huge difference . take my word it . windows world not worth it . whenever i go my mom computer ( which running windows xp , ) i encounter lock up or annoying hickup os , every time !! i agree good amount people don't find windows unstable , but even when i go friend house i notice them there well . every windows computer i used more than 20 minutes locked up . but it not just this , it also tiger so much easier use . take my advice ( i've converted many people ) switch mac ... please . i swear most you who read this switch very pleased . it might little wierd first get used new os , but i mastered it day when it took me months windows . plus you purchase microsoft word mac well ( which i think easier use than window counterpart . ) so go throw ugly windows computer away get spanking new , shiny white , stable , mac !!!	-1

reviews this software bit harsh , but pretty much true . it slow , resource hog , doesn't really like share machine other applications . support bad , email transfer move it system just plain doesn't work it really hard make complete backup all your attachments . - windows vista support really limited . said , if you really fast machine it work well features i use every day i can't get anywhere else . you save any email history record attached sender or any other person your contact database . these attachments copies so they stay database even if you purge your email ( which nice ) . email client simple , but because it isn't outlook - i personally almost completely unaffected worms , virus other email hazards over years affected most ms outlook users . this feature saved me more time than hassles first paragraph . program runs smoothly me but , i core 2 duo 7200 2 gigabytes ram . just fastest processor you get . i think without maximum processor memory you delays slooow loading times . one more issue you might making backups . since it uses sql database open whenever sql server running , normal backup program might not able backup database file . you need stop service first . this hassle if you don't know you might setting yourself up disaster .	-1

( btw , 4 messages total 2007 section 6 months . i guess most pay their 300 bucks moderated forum . ) 8 . example how time consuming it : it took me week phone calls several reps get upgrade installation function . i mean it didn't function all . it made such mess i reformat my hard drive get it install . first 20+ years computer use . sage seems think this program only one user installs their computer . bad attitude . sage act ! poster children everything bad software industry today . yourself favor , if older versions working you ... stay there . enhancements 2007 not worth trouble . if you're looking contact manager , look elsewhere .	-1

i bought new state-of-the-art computer february came preloaded windows vista . i initially excited get computer running newest operating system , i hoped it would mean my computer would much longer effective life . i nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine , especially knowing i called dell , they would installed xp instead . pros : -better security ( it prompts me allows me stop some annoying " automatic " programs software makers sneak onto your system)-better appearance ( this strictly cosmetic , i'd rather stare ugly screen worked rather than pretty , useless one)cons : -freezing : i use this computer 2-3 hours day i expect 1-2 freezes/day . restarting often fails , i cut power restart again . -display problems : although cosmetics program better , vista can't display anything right . i tried updating display driver which caused major crash after restarting . i boot safe mode rollback driver get my computer back . apparently , newest display drivers incompatible vista . -incompatibility : entirely too many programs incompatible vista , including some fairly big ones ( lots adobe software , ipods , display drivers , etc . ) i know vista new , these software companies slow adapt , but it really make sense operating system like vista render virtually all my other software obsolete ? why can't vista play nicely other kids ? -its slow !!! -- part reason i bought new , state-of-the-art computer replace my old laptop ( which still runs ok , but become little buggy sluggish past 4 years ) . although this computer light years ahead old one , it actually runs even slower than my old laptop . technical support largely attributed this demands vista . bottom line : 1 . if you not good computers , avoid vista like plague2 . vista rip-off . save your money keep/get xp -- i'm probably going return my computer make manufacturer install xp so i regain some speed system stability . maybe future vista work ok , but not right now ... 3 . incompatibility issues -- though there several -- conspicuously include problems mac-oriented software ( ipod , adobe ) . i can't help but feel microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues order battle apple	-1

this huge waste money . if you plans make custom animation , not buy this . anime only alows you manipulate one their few charecters . you not change eye color or hair color . if you want good animation you go one their websites purchase character $10- $20 . their free ones completly dumb . using their " easy use " bone rigging tool takes long time set up use . it took me ten minutes make one stick figure . ( which didn't work very well ) you can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version . i spent hours trying use this , could figure none above out . it also took two weeks get here instead four days . i don't recomend this people who looking easy use animation creator .	-1
i used intuit products since 1992 , quite satisfied until 4 years ago when intuit began installing hidden software users ' computers attempt " stop piracy " , which caused numerous problems us honest users who paid program . secondly even more significantly , i began noticing apparent shift intuit philosophy toward it customers : cut back customer support , attempt exploit them every possible opportunity order make more money . short , intuit disrespects their customers . loyal paying customer , i not disrespected or taken granted . their level service support declined . their products constantly pimp you spend more money intuit you try use their programs . why i sworn off intuit products when there alternative . why reward someone who treats you badly ?	-1

ok , sorry , i've vectoring line art since 1990 . my current machine amd athlon xp 333 fsb , 1 gig ram 80 gig hd shared network 40 gig hd software , os xppro , it 2 years old i think . i installed three cathode ray tubes , you know ; big boxy monitors , largest which 21 inch monster right my face all day . i read reviews here started " quaking " my boots ! oops i said myself , i looked up my previous day purchases new artist i just hired . sure enough ; i bought cs2 new machine . so i downloaded 30 day trial illustrator cs2 upyours , i mean upgrade . replacing my old illustrator 8.01 these kids i've interviewing made me think i should take look outside my cave ! so i got it loaded up sure enough ; it takes longer load than my old corrupted rusty buddy ; illustrator 8.01 , twice long . ( so leave it running ) !!!!!!!!! but wow !!!!!!! i should this sooner , or should i ? soon it running illustrator cs2 auto updated itself . it wanted it adobe bridge fixed up . so i let it . this just exactly what people complaining . ******** bridge fixed ********* way super cool dude ! i keep bridge open right monitor i drag art into illustrator cs2 lightning speed . whole time i get see super big previews all artwork i need work . way better than xppro little thumbnails . live trace : realy nice , i think this what these companies using sell vectored line art printers like me . it very accurate seems acomodate all those nasty giant pixels up till now , took human brain see past while vectoring . ok , it not good skilled craftsman such ( full ) myself , but only $160 or so , it like gift almighty god ! no crashes , no bugs , just pure inteligence adobe once again . don't you think little white mud hut dessert when you say adobe ? i really apreciate object oriented work bar thing top , wait , let me go look what it called , hmmmm , still don't know , well it changes according what kind object you've clicked your artwork . also this new wonder technology solves old problem global color change needed color separation work . top task bar object oriented do-hickey similar but better than one photoshop . transparent objects , looks like everything transparent , wow , you know what means ??? i gotta go use it some more , it just way cool . ok , i'm back , even fonts transparent , . tiffs . jpgs , everything . this means way less jumping back forth photoshop illustrator . but i believe you very capable your hardware , operating system , least year ; full time illustrator photoshop fully appreciate thought creative potential adobe opened up us	1
i decided get this office suite after using it recently . i've usually worked office 97 2000 , but 2003 version some pretty cool features not found older versions . feature i really enjoy pivot report feature ms access , which wasn't ms access 2000 . this truly great reporting feature . you now use access front-end slice dice data stored data warehouses oracle , sql server , sybase other enterprise-type databases . if you're used creating crosstab reports , you'll definitely like pivot report feature . crosstabs limited 2 dimensions but there no limitation number dimensions pivot repor t.t o me , main drawback price .

it basic job well . calibration runs smoothly accurately . hardware looks feels solid . my two completely different brand , size age crt monitors ended up exactly same colors sitting side side . user interface merely adequate . pop up help instructions better than many i seen . you need know already how calibration buttons your monitors work ( hardwired buttons monitor , not software ) . order make any edits you must run entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you use " back " within calibration , sometimes you must start over . also separate " profile chooser " utility software , not add or delete profile feature - even if it profile created saved calibration software earlier . you see it windows display properties , but it may not appear profile chooser list . dual monitors one obvious reason choose pro over plus version . yes , it dual monitors , but asterisk . it create separate profiles , but only apply correct profiles automatically startup both monitors if you two separate video cards . if you single video card dual outputs , it load same profile ( last one you created ) both monitors startup . this quirk documented readme file installation disk ( blames windows problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere advertising material , catalogs , or box . fortunately there work around ( not documented ) least my particular video card running xp . after windows opens , you run profile chooser then choose correct profile each monitor . you may use windows display properties settings specify default profile rerun calibration get profiles you want appear profile chooser select correct profile default . once it all set up , running profile chooser four five click procedure , but you must rememeber check it before using any application uses color profiles . check it after you open application . i've them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .	-1

i tested numerous anti-virus programs after getting fed-up previous norton anti-virus , which would always " hang " my incoming email , causing me redownload larger files sometimes make it impossible retrieve them all . ( incidentally , this nothing " time-out " settings . ) after testing other top rated anti-virus programs , only one wouldn't " hang " large email files , kaspersky . even though i my " time-out " set only 1 minute , kaspersky never stumbles lets go , even if it takes much more than 1 minute download . i also like easy use " pause protection " when i'm doing file clean-ups , because there no sense passing temporary files through second time , it speeds clean-up 5 times faster	1

i read lot reviews ( here elsewhere ) warning final cut massive learning curve , i believe helped soften blow when i first tried this program . because there definitely learning curve -- this far more complex than imovie . but , good news , it not beyond newbie reach!i'm such newbie anything video , it pitiful . i only made two or three small movies imovie , they weren't very sophisticated . i mostly just tinkered around . but , fool i am , i decided i wanted get final cut express go new camcorder i just purchased . because i prepared re-learn ( or struggle ) first final cut , i purchased book ( version 2 fce , which perfectly suitable ) . armed my book limited expectations , i set trying make fun little " music video " ( using video clips still pictures ) . amazingly enough , i learned how " ken burns effect " pictures , make transitions one clip next , edit sound so one track would predominate part video , then fade out other parts . i able fix video clips ( zoom , lighten , change aspect ratio ) . then i added titles livetext . all this first two days using final cut ! sure , little video i made no award-winner , but it actually servicable , fun little project i wasn't too ashamed show my friends . ( thing fixing aspect ratio one video clips -- there this one clip seemed resistent any tweaking or adjusting i tried it . i used multiple programs try resize it correct dimensions , but something always went wrong . either picture quality degraded terribly , or else corrected dimensions didn't " stick " it bounced back distorted . nothing worked -- until final cut . i'm sure other programs could same thing , but i tried so many , failed . so thing impressed me ! )i know there whole lot more learn final cut , i certainly don't anticipate i'll become master it . but it offer * lot * more flexibility than imovie , it definitely lot fun . right way approach it , i believe , start small , expect baby steps first , fun , get book ! book absolutely essential . if you impatient soul who expects perfection first day , this not application you . because you learn " it manually , " you much more control -- but it takes time learn it all . oh , note hardware : i made my first little video 1.25 ghz g4 mac mini 512 megs ram . it wasn't speed demon any means , but because my video short ( 2 minutes ) , it really wasn't too painfully slow most time ( except rendering , but i guess going slow anyway ) . i since upgraded mini 1 gb ram , * everything * snappier , so i highly recommend it . but it good know even little mac mini less-than-impressive ram work fce .	1

i television editing my church i dabble alittle home . i many editing programs i use music video editing home movies cams 8mm . i nero 6 it ok , but nero7 ultra ( enhanced ) taken place all other programs . it my primary editing suite music videos . music i make changes songs skating programs where i would send out words removed or create cd pleasure . this program remarkable , there still somethings i not yet used , this best but this type program under $800.00 how much programs we use studio starting price . buying this program great investment .	1
i previously nero 6 it tons bugs me . i upgraded 7 ultra enhanced when i upgraded my computer vista premium , i pleasantly surprised . everything i tried so far flawless . it seems different systems different results nero . example some people say nero 6 works best them , but my old system it horrible ( running win2k ) . it complicated software though , so people should give nero break . overall they great job . just download trial first see how it runs your system .	1

high school college i studied french three years i convinced i would starve death paris trying understand menu then get myself understood . much changed not i am half way through rosetta stone program . my ear now tuned language . i visceral feeling grammar ability discern tenses . my vocabulary still needs get stronger , but now i distinguish individual words stream french , only matter practice language . advertised , this program painless progress rapid . try demo , you'll see .	1
overall i would highly recommend rosetta stone software even though it bit over priced certainly insufficient your primary learning method . rosetta stone * combined * pimsleur great method languages similar your native language . disks copy protected serious drawback you need cd drive any time you going use it you can't use backup copy safety . rosetta stone lessons quick , easy fun , thus encouraging usage . if you afford it i would definitely recommend combining pimsleur rosetta stone . both excellent products far better than less expensive products commonly available . but neither alone sufficient effective learning language . could rosetta stone improved ? certainly . more diverse better graphics would help . graphics they use very good but occasionally picture isn't quite clear meaning . example if you supposed select " boy horse " you may not realize it boy horse . if you questioning if you should get rosetta stone or not , just get free demo cd their website try it yourself . far i tell full product exactly same demo but obviously you access more lessons	1
it seems last few office releases i purchased haven't really offered anything different , but this one . interface totally changed takes some getting used . i would suggest upgrading office 2007 when you little time figure out new layout not if you jump right into project . new toolbars seem really thought out very user friendly . if you aren't into change prefer status quo standard , file edit tools ... layout , then this product not you . if you willing spend couple hours getting used new layout ( it quite easy ) you won't sorry because it well worth it .	1

i purchased mangadebut because i wanted dabble tones inking ( which i usually never , usually i just scan sketch then darken it photo editing . ) i came find out using lines erasing sketch makes much more clean finished product . course , you could acomplish this ms paint if you really wanted . one main ( only , my opinion ) advantages this program amazingly vast variations tones available make your art more interesting . alone makes it worth 50 dollars you put into it . one downside this program , because it many tones , uses requires quite bit space . when i uploaded it my laptop , it slowed down significantly . so much so now i load it when i want finish nice drawing delete it computer again ! xdoverall it deserves 3-4 stars . ^.^	-1

brain builder series visual auditory exercises aimed improving attention , concentration memory . this consists seven exercises , one involving visual reaction speed accuracy six memorizing sting randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually one three modes -- base ( straightforward ) reverse ( you must give back string reverse order given ) flash ( visual numbers presented one time instead all once like base ) or random ( auditory where you cope numbers read uneven pace ) . you then immediately tested type what those . there no time limit response . you progress higher levels -- which means memorizing more numbers faster during viewing or listening -- initially determined baseline test taken when first starting . different voices -- men , women , adults , children -- read auditory presentations . all all , i found it fairly sophisticated exercises seem help even beyond matters number memorization . primary shortcoming seemed lack feedback or coaching other than telling you not get discouraged keep working hard . also , progress summeraries ( bar graphs ) fail take into account higher levels scoring purposes so day day comparison results seems too flat . overall , i enjoyed program stuck it although there some days i wish more variety something else than just repeat numbers . what they say only practice 10 minutes day--well--i've spend more like 30 minutes or more enough exercises feel satisfied my progress	-1

turbotax great service , but i would like able navigate menus/tabs greater degree specificity within input pages itself . writing return often requires back-tracking page you alread covered . get particular prior page , i would often forced go through up 5 or 6 prior pages , reading question each time because turbotax highlighted default which not my previous choice . this colossal waste time otherwise excellent product . it could easily fixed 2006 software if turbotax 1 ) switched defaults users ' previously-inputted values ( completetax this it seems like obvious thing ) and/or made it easy navigate prior page giving link every input page when user clicks superior tab or link . this what good web-page , it would very helpful if turbotax same .	-1

i found product work very well antivirus , spyware spam . it nice one product reasonable price multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products their associated cost maintenance . i using norton 2004 , but it only good job viruses . although it would detect spyware after fact , it poor job removing them . i also used ms beta , which although detected more spyware than norton , would not block it . i one computer always seemed crippled spyware . since i installed pc-cillin , i've no problems . i've also found spam blocker work fairly well , catching 80% spam . i using multiple rules spam list outlook , probably only blocked 40% spam , so this big improvement . my only complaint rebate- i sent required info it rejected due " invalid/missing ups . " i then sent copy ups they indicated missing , but never got anything back .	1

don't think video capture cards , going into operating system , or even opening computer case - just turn power , plug dazzle usb plug into your usb port , connect colored cords your vcr same colored plugs dazzle , install software , let this wonderful tool all heavy lifting . excellent quality , they lower quality if you want smaller file - like , say , if you want back-up your vcr cd-r . test quality time - tell it record 70 minutes , your work . i really like fact software so stable , i recorded six hour vcr tape using 512 meg xp machine - not moment problem . they also included software makes editing these video files real easy , if you want . just icing cake . strong , solid , silent - john wayne vcr computer file translator tools . aside , i held onto some vcr tapes years , one more than decade , hoping something like dazzle would come . prayers answered . just shut up buy it	1

i think some reviewers here not use program more enough , am using it since version 2 till now illustrator this program can't beated ... gradient fill so stupid create earlier versions adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together form gradient fill then you mask it within path or shape you filling , one more thing mask corel " container " wonderful tool much better than mask used illustrator sucks ( u see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it ) you want more i lot mention . am using both program everyday know them very well honest i all artwork coreldraw then i export illustrator color separation printing becuase printers agancies my country don't know how use corel so i ride wave finalize thing illustrator . i all detailed drawings precisely using guidelines grid ( first available corel ) creating layouts , realistic objects or models shadings shadowing well ease this software so powerfull if you real artist you must get i	1

this probably one most outstanding rewarding software programs i ever remember purchasing . i never learned how type , so i reserved myself many computer projects/reports , email responses business related aspects due this ' achilles heel ' . well , i researched this software found it come long way earlier versions decided it time give it try . i even bought plantronics cs55 - usb wireless headset get go give this software real workout . let me tell you , my pessimism definitely challenged because software worked extremely good 20 minutes after opening box browsing tutorial . i talking sentences watched it appear my monitor within seconds . i speeded up my speach if talking normal conversation someone this software just kept spitting it on-screen . amazing !!!! don't get me wrong . there occasional misspellings deal but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it prevents same mistakes occuring next time . it begins gain more more accuracy . salvation found far i'm concerne d.p.s. i began running program win xp - 512mb ram it performed very well . i just upped 2 gigs ram . most everyone forums recommends least 1 gig ram . i this review 1 min . only two misspells .	1
product nice clean interface . i able load most drivers application software without incident . note - upgrade install requirements not clear . microsoft should state what expected your system prior trying install either upgrade or clean install . microsoft sites keep pointing back sites don't help very much .	-1
this my second version/upgrade . it very easy use i sought it out when upgrading my previous version . love it	1
i bought this program my daughter her birthday . she wanted it because she used it school ( 1st grade ) . i impressed how easy it install - i installed it admin , she no issues running it under her limited account ( xp pro ) . i've impressed what she able program . she even made valentine day cards her whole class it . just prepared go through lot color ink	1
essential microsoft office 2007 users running windows vista . office 2007 already provides pdf converter ; however , it not allow security , editing , or markup . pdf converter -- without tech support hassles adobe . since my new hp computer came adobe reader already installed vista environment , i kept it default pdf reader , i use pdf converter professional actual , stand alone conversion or editing pdf documents . pdf converter very easy custom install feature . i disabled all microft office , internet explorer , outlook add-ins , i installed product . it all works together extremely well .	-1
after looking other reviews , i bit puzzled . i haven't any problems other folks mention . pdf converter professional 4 doesn't everything programs costing five times much money . but , who cares ? background colors business form ? why ???? don't buy camry say " gee ... i liked my lexus better . " most you going buy this program one - or both - these two things : 1)convert pdf documents into completely editable word docs , excel worksheets , or one dozens other formats ... 2)combine documents various formats into single pdf . picture customer manual consists word , excel , solidworks , quicken , powerpoint project documents . you want put them all together one document complete table contents , bookmarks thumbnails . voila ! this proram you ! these purposes , pdf 4 professional superb . it easy use . we several users , not one refer manual or line support . put pdf converter test , we recently scanned , then saved-as-a-pdf crooked , not highly legible fax . we then converted it into word document , roughly 90% it came through perfectly . amazing . highly recommended	1
coreldraw my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up my desk small " mom pop " screenprinting shop i worked . back then , corel came oodles free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not mention free technical support via toll-free number . i stayed corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop always my photo-editing program choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " it " me . industry demands eventually delegated i delve into adobe illustrator . already familiar adobe photoshop features , tools " look feel " , illustrator didn't present huge , overbearing learning curve . illustrator , i found same robust features coreldraw ... which wasn't what impressed me illustrator . adobe intuitive programs , their ability interact one ... seamlessly ... what won me over illustrator . illustrator ability edit/create pdf their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files photoshop ... layers intact ??? wow !!! ( i could go on)now , said ... there still things i prefer coreldraw compared illustrator . extrude function corel much easier utilize . powerclip function more user friendly than illustrator " make clipping mask " function . ability customize/edit/add shortcut keys amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on)in regards importing exporting files other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts robust set import export filters , my favorite . eps import filter which lets you import . eps while converting fonts curves during import . this must if you work . eps file created computer whose fonts you lack . if i dollar every . eps pulls into illustrator fonts blown out ... i'd independently wealthy . why illustrator never implemented this beyond me . so , sum it up ... coreldraw great program ... but i can't imagine it my only vector drawing program . just like real life , you need great team . this program , paired adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly	-1

xitel inport deluxe what it says it . you plug any rca aux connector into unit software provided you record it stereo your computer . it good solid product what it says it but instead focusing features like other reviewers i point out its minor drawbacks . first , audacity , free software mentioned manual tendency freeze up while recording unit . however , i don't know if it freeze up your computer . second , if you thinking buying this product turn lps cds , into most lp players don't rca aux plugs you'll need buy addapter . ( what they don't tell you manual if you this you first need adjust volume stereo recorder volume parallel which kinda tricky . ) finally , manual could use more detail because some important features weren't mentioned . if you don't mind these drawbacks , you able many years recording pleasure if you buy this product	-1

love program .... hate company!i've using quickbooks more than 10 years . i started basic edition since i am very small business use only portion program , specifically customer vendor lists , invoicing , a/r purchase orders . overkill understatement ... quickbooks pro much more powerful than i need . i don't use payroll , check printing , year end accounting many its other functions . so why i purchase such powerful program ? that " rub " . intuit not satisfied its quickbooks users content edition they using ; intuit sales people call all too frequently trying get you upgrade next higher version ( edition ) their program . they hounded me years upgrade early basic edition then current basic edition ; finally , they dropped support product i no choice . i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition 2005 . shortly after purchasing it , they informed me they no longer going support 2005 basic edition if i wanted continued support i would upgrade again , this time pro edition . this january ( 2007 ) i received email intuit informing me my 2005 basic edition wouldn't run new windows xp vista platform if i switched vista i would need upgrade quickbooks pro . i upgraded new pc february result major crash my former system opted go vista , thinking i could install windows 98 second operating system run quickbooks 2005 basic . second operating system didn't work out , after seriously considering switching microsoft accounting 2007 , i purchased quickbooks pro . i very disappointed intuit didn't offer significant purchase incentive existing users ; but they never all years i've using their product . even microsoft , shark sharks , offers incentives . don't misheartened . i purchased program amazon , rebates other purchase incentives , saved $60 over intuit price ; i could saved additional $25 if i bought ebay ( i known it time ) .	-1

first time several versions microsoft changed file format . however , it better . new files all compressed using zip compression format so files much smaller ( old files 3-4 times larger than new files ) . new file formats supposed compatible cross platform specification ( i.e. linux geeks open office documents ) . new interface radically different . not install this if you large project complete . interface so different you not complete time . however , after month so you wonder how you ever got without it	1

i bought bhg deluxe 7.0 software plan addition . i talked companies shopped around before purchasing . i not talk imsi floor plan 3d , i gave up after trying get through human . i would bet guess software good imsi telephone skills . i talked punch software warned away their product their own tech i integrated video my computer . apparently you need video card minimum video memory render drawings any usable speed using punch software . punch software loss , not mine that ridiculous issue consumer software product . chief architect offered money back guarantee their better homes gardens products , even if purchased via vendors like amazon . i'll keep this better homes gardens home designer deluxe software , even though it it annoying quirks . even lesser package pro version , library items it very limited . i would guess there quite few more pro version , but it odd not include more most standard items many home owners would need when laying out home . you learn just use nearly matched symbol fill space , even though it not correct symbol or size item . since i am not interested 3d view , this not big issue me . item i needed most floorplanning . 3d modeling extra item i may play , but not essential me personally . if you truly interested 3d aspect , this issue . i would recommend visiting product forum see what best choice . [ ... ] quick easy floor plan software few extras , this software better than ok . no experience necessary , short tutorial videos get you started quickly . i issues not able more control wall types , there some odd roof design limitations even mid low priced consumer package . these annoying enough urge upgrade pro if you want more control all aspects . since i laying out floor plan , then turning it over architect real softare , it not problem me . i few restarts due drawings getting all wild messed up , but ignoring autosaved drawings , i able go back my last manually saved drawing start known good point . this software upgrade options download company site . just like any good software company , they provide spftware patches download . i would definately recommend this software quick way floor plans . adding walls , doors , windows , other items very simple . just don't plan perfection , it based prefabbed walls limited whole inches , not fractions . angles issue well . if you need specific angles , this not package , it preset increments only . i wish it default preferences user could select well . able preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite bit redo . i hope software companies read these reviews . there alot good information how improve products .	-1

i purchased this product needing work personal legal ( nonbusiness ) matter , so noncommercial license fine my " home " use . good thing i checked corel after buying it seeing " home edition " captions not only total suite packaging but underneath " wordperfect " " quattro pro " components ( inside front box folding cover velcro ) . corel ultimately confirmed me " certain components designed business customer , such legal tools , metadata removal , document compare , quickfinder name few not included home edition version . " corel needs make this clearer their marketing " home edition . " i focused word processing application , but quattro pro application also captioned " home edition " so it may missing some features available quattro pro included other suite versions ( standard , pro , student/teacher , etc . ) . home edition may still suitable some users , but i'm strong believer " full disclosure . " wordperfect itself great program . try setting point sizes decimals word -- you can't . try changing size font legal pleadings word -- there no direct control it ( microsoft site instructs you change margins number lines per page attempt get word adjust font size ) [ but remember , you need any wordperfect version other than home edition get legal tools ]	-1
i purchased both home gardens interior punch interior software . home gardens much easier use . you really start without reading much manual . punch demands you read manual ( 342 pages ) . it not intuative . but punch so much more so much more creativity . ie : punch library trees , shrubs flowers your yard . home gardens only potted plants , nothing you use landscape . punch also allows you make custom doors or windows your exact specifications . hg doesn't . you choose set style door or window change options . i also could place digital photos my backyard behind my " house " punch make it more realisitic . i like both software programs , but punch more options , but you your homework first	-1

coreldraw my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up my desk small " mom pop " screenprinting shop i worked . back then , corel came oodles free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not mention free technical support via toll-free number . i stayed corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop always my photo-editing program choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " it " me . industry demands eventually delegated i delve into adobe illustrator . already familiar adobe photoshop features , tools " look feel " , illustrator didn't present huge , overbearing learning curve . illustrator , i found same robust features coreldraw ... which wasn't what impressed me illustrator . adobe intuitive programs , their ability interact one ... seamlessly ... what won me over illustrator . illustrator ability edit/create pdf their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files photoshop ... layers intact ??? wow !!! ( i could go on)now , said ... there still things i prefer coreldraw compared illustrator . extrude function corel much easier utilize . powerclip function more user friendly than illustrator " make clipping mask " function . ability customize/edit/add shortcut keys amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on)in regards importing exporting files other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts robust set import export filters , my favorite . eps import filter which lets you import . eps while converting fonts curves during import . this must if you work . eps file created computer whose fonts you lack . if i dollar every . eps pulls into illustrator fonts blown out ... i'd independently wealthy . why illustrator never implemented this beyond me . so , sum it up ... coreldraw great program ... but i can't imagine it my only vector drawing program . just like real life , you need great team . this program , paired adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .	-1

my four-year-old son loved first fritz chesster so much i just get second . i would gotten third installment well , but it appears require dvd-rom more up-to-date software than he his computer ( i suggest you always review those details before buying ) . like first , this second installment same quirky artistic sensibility lots amusing details keep me interested it he . first one seemed lot more " british " than this one . just one example : first installment , pawns often depicted english villagers low-brow accents . this installment they more often texas ranchers ... there also numerous britishisms first installment tough understand child . this one thankfully free them . i suppose american audience proved more lucrative than original designers expected .... i think suggested age more 6-or-above ( they really should able read , i suppose ) , but little help even younger child ( such my son ) get into most exercises spend time it . there several more advanced features this one than first installment . here focus basic tactics , openings , endgame situations . so child should really made it through first one before getting this . he absolutely know all rules , instance -- second installment not going teach them . first also some wonderful exercises just pawns or kings board , instance , much teach . some fun games like maze monster chasing you ( teach rook moves ) or cannon fires diagonally ( teach bishop ) . some games here ( which resemble early video games , like space invaders ) little too advanced four-year-old manual dexterity .... perhaps six-year-old well . but there many things he get into nonetheless , especially if you take time explain things get them started . overall , i'd say if you want give child introduction game , nothing beats first fritz chesster . other chess teaching video games much darker less helpful , really , beginners . if he or she likes first installment ( which also very girl-friendly ) , then all means advance second -- especially kids over 6	1

well presented , easy follow , easy revisit previous lessons . videos illustrated fretboard really help see hear how song should played . not lot depth material but probably right level maintain attention most students . some accompanyment/singing could better but overall good job presenting music so student practice . some material/songs may not everyones liking , but again , these okay beginner . singing slight destraction sometimes . i probably wouldn't recommend this only source learning guitar .... i don't think most people buying it would think it all every need become great guitar player . i'm sure teacher would still very advantageous especially when it comes pointing out bad habits may creep into new students technique . i'm trying learn without teacher well found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this good product provides good start learning play guitar .	-1

main reason negative reviews past extra charge mp3 encoder . this version , mp3 encoder included . magix pretty clever designing interface used quickly yet several more advanced features you use you become more proficient . these include full featured waveform editor very powerful sonagram ( spectral ) editor . also , somewhat hidden ability record 78rpm records 33 1/3 turntable . if you use full set features almost any record made totally free pops clicks . i two very minor negatives ; amplitude scale track display somewhat truncated , declicker so few artifacts i recommend always using it maximum setting ( opposed wizard manual recommendations . ) far pc requirements , i believe any program lot number crunching needs fairly up-to-date processor . this one particularly so because it leaves original audio files intact . i don't believe this negative some prior reviews . short , i totally satisfied this program ability make clean transfers both 78rpm 33 1/3 rpm records .	1

i agree , windows could improve thier products but i'm not going jump linux bandwagon just yet . you get this product academic 84.00 web . i own several copies my home computers . if you network use wireless this program use . i use both unix windows work unix far more stable . compatibility issues what kills unix/linux now linux not user friendly . future apple linux some same issues windows deal they become more popular . windows dominates reason . also , when you upgrade select full install not upgrade . you need full version copy windows 98 , windows me , or windows 2000 accomplish this . registering your software microsoft virtually painless , even if you need new key . you load windows five times before your key expires . point you call them new one . i'd buy this product again amazon great company deal with- five stars them !!	-1
i ordered box version amazon , instead download manufacturer not only because it less expensive , but main reason so i would paper manual . so many programs don't come hard copy manuals i prefer them over on-line help . program itself , i trialed download first . me , thing i fell love ability call up multiple images , side side , compare them ! it makes selecting best image breeze - huge timesaver . you also ability swiftly zoom check focus full rez . wonderful thing putting curser over one preview images , sliding it , slide all open previews simultaneously , so you don't individually zoom move each image . you this up 6 images time ! you also quick histogram check hitting " " key , which makes it easy toss off bad exposures same time review . while you've got previews open you hover mouse over them hit any # key color-code image . colors keyed whatever description you want . i " 1 = green " yes , " 2 = yellow " maybe , " 3 = red " no . there room quite few more colors after . i then hit sort key back main screen quickly select all red " no " images delete them . after i all my green " yes " images , i then review them 6 time give them star ratings . i resort rating now all best images top page i start processing them . you batch process file name , some other things i don't bother , well . it got some nice keywording ability you easily sync keywords your photoshop files . what incredibly nice you click any word keyword list all images you own , those keywords , immediately shown thumbnails ! finding image actually fun ! it even give you thumbnails images you don't even store your hard drive anymore ! fantastic program - i highly recommend it ! only reason i didn't 5 star it b/c it not all intuitive . this read-the-manual kind program , but you awful lot it without get too far book . ;)	-1

after removing symantec installing zonealarm my computer speeded up factor least 10 . i'm not certain why symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast -in my case it insisted scanning every program transferred used scanning every outgoing email even though i truned those features off . i recommend zonealarm users some expertise - during initial usage you need understand what programs allow what block ( look them up google )	1
i bought version 5 this software few years ago very pleased many features . tech my isp ( bellsouth ) recommended this software me . i recently purchased version 6 my new laptop which running windows xp pro . installation snap . updates frequent install quickly my dsl connection . software suite my opinion more better features than norton pro which i use my desktop . i really like registry cleaner ( fixer ) defrag tools . ( they use trend micro virus protection ) program allows simple maintenance or more experienced users indepth tools allow you maintain tweak your system . there lot extra programs come this software i not install after reading some reviews warnings using them . however , my personal experience after installing just system suit 6 professional really good me . i bought my copy walmart filled out rebate following instructions carefully i received my rebate after 6 weeks . i hope if anyone buys this software because my recommendation similar results . i would rate my knowledge computers above average , which may why i not any problems software .	1

i , too , used complain norton poor customer service awful inability smoothly upgrade . until i tried two other major products home changed employers one major norton competitor ( products included mcafee antivirus , computerassociates ' etrust , couple well-rated free-ware packages ) . bottom line protection without getting way . according numerous reviews , norton provides excellent protection . addition , it ability exclude known safe directories it stops protecting almost immediately when you realize it spending lot cpu cycles scanning known good file you ask it stop -- example , etrust menu allows you tell it stop , but it doesn't take effect until next transaction , which too late speed up lengthy , trustworthy transaction . norton easy intuitive configure , even its significantly more complex internet security package . all products i've tried , including major ones , fail one or all these key attributes . therefore , i'll put up norton awful renewal process weak customer service order product what it designed flexible enough reasonable it . since recent reviews reveal no single product provides good coverage against spyware , i supplement norton product periodic scans spyware using " adaware " " pest patrol " , i keep " startup inspector " installed guard	-1

this my 3rd year doing my taxes turbotax . i encountered some bugs non-material stuff , but i didn't go hand-check entire return so i don't know if there would any material bugs would actually affect dollar amounts . bugs i encountered following : - when asking me changes my address which it imported last year return , it didn't provide phone numbers . one those phone numbers changed . later , when doing state taxes , it asked which phone number i wanted use . time , it provided choice old phone number but didn't allow me update it . - it seemed import all information my financial institution ok it reported dollar amounts net proceeds cost basis correctly . however , worksheet , even though description said it sale 50 shares , quantity field said one share . little bugs like these make me wonder if all math underneath ok . i'm also worried if you run program different order , results might different . but who knows ? cursory check things looked ok . one thing i bummed when entering buys corresponding stock sale it allowed me enter things reverse chronological order ( fact didn't prompt me otherwise ) yet end program when doing audit checks , it wanted me reenter data chronological order . i didn't bother since it only affected worksheet . i'm keeping my fingers crossed there no material errors ! unfortunately , it looks like other tax products also these kinds weird bugs	-1
final cut express hd awesome . but don't try learn how use fce your own - buy book such final cut express dummies spend some time working through concepts . i previously used adobe premiere , so making switch fce not quite hurdle going others . if you make jump imovie , realize you need spend lot time learning how use fce . if you going edit simple home movies , probably stick imovie . imovie quick simple . but professional results , definitely use fce . but realize there fairly steep learning curve . once mastered , editing fce quick . i use fce professional quality editing work when i need edit down multiple cameras shooting simultaneously ( feature final cut pro now makes automatic , but not fce ) , complex editing involving numerous audio video tracks . i routinely re-arrange my audio one clip overlay over . i also routinely adjust audio levels mix multiple audio tracks . while fce hd comes soundtrack application , most my audio editing fce audio tools directly . livetype titling application also bundled fce hd enables creation broadcast quality titling titling effects . livetype worth price fce hd alone ! fce also includes huge assortment both audio video filters adjust or clean up original content , or color filters match colors multiple cameras . except simple home movies , where i still sometimes use imovie , i use fce hd everything else . i could not produce type material i create without fce hd . i strongly recommend fce anyone wishing produce professional quality video results , especially those who need synchronize mix multiple video audio tracks and/or use advanced titling features livetype . like most video applications , more ram better . fce sort runs my 640 mb ram powerbook g4 . but it files my dual 867 mhz g4 2 gb ram ( but 1 gb would plenty ) . if you going doing video editing , gb ram very desirable	1

since i remember , fantastic four always my favorite comic book . it not just characters interesting their own issues , but it also they human well superheroes . appeal ben grimm , sweetness sue storm , brash johnny storm ultra-scientific ( never quite dorky ) reed richards perfect team because they grew together drew you into their lives . but let not forget ff also brought many novel comic aspects : watcher , negative zone , inhumans , course , galactus silver surfer . growing up ff i consider " golden era " this comic book years which stan lee jack kirby worked them ( up issue 100 or so ) . particular , issues introduction black panther ( one my all-time favorite stories ) introduction him ( warlock ) particularly interesting . this 2 year time frame , dr. doom stole silver surfer powers , kree resurfaced , blastaar made his presence known while reed danger negative zone . all wonderful stories , jack kirby artwork its peak . you see all this yourself this collection more . you read stan most eloquent prose admire jack creative capabilities one great comic book artists . you also able see ebb flow stories , how different writers took ff other directions , how comic book floundered how it reborn . indeed , due its longevity , ff not just indomitable team 4 superheroes , but collective effort great artists writers brought these creations life pages medium not considered artistic many . collection contained dvd all acrobat format scanned images real comic books . thus , you see yellowing pages , smudges , tears , etc . me , this good thing , because it shows comics collector items . ( i don't think making antique look new good thing . if antique well-preserved , ok , but it still antique . ) whole , i am very satisfied this purchase few dollars took stroll down memory lane convenience my computer or laptop . i still my own collection , including those captured marvel collectors item classics ( first reprints ff comics later became marvel greatest comics ) , but collection this set unsurpassed well worth every penny	1
if you want get digital photos out your camera out email , this good place start . snapfire puts basic functions where you find them makes them relatively easy understand . it helps if you understand pixel dimensions , but it isn't required . first thing you need see how big your photo when displayed computer screen email recipient . simply open photo click " zoom 100% . " that true size . if you drag your photo into photo tray ( see more below dragging restrictions ) , you also see photo dimensions file size placing your cursor over photo thumbnail . if photo too big you want resize it , you so edit menu ( " resize " ) setting new pixel dimensions ( e.g. 800x600 ) or setting new size percentage original . then view resulting photo size using " zoom 100% " . when it right size , save it . crop also easy . you crop any shape you want , or standard proportions ( e.g. 4x6 ) . again , " zoom 100% " see results . that pretty much all it takes get photo ready email . my only complaint when you resized photo it still your editing window , you can't see its current properties ( dimensions file size ) without saving it . ( when you save it , it placed photo tray , you put your cursor over it see details . ) snapfire standard photo enhancement options such red-eye correction , " quick fix , " adjustments brightness warmth , also " makeover " option which used whiten teeth remove blemishes . you also , course , rotate photos . you insert text add picture frames . same options available other software , but i like fact this product not so overloaded options it difficult use . i would find it relatively easy guide someone through processes even if they inexperienced . it still all features i would need . i haven't used download software , but it appears put photos into my pictures , standard location . when you go snapfire home page , you first highlight folder you want work using " find files " left pane . individual photos folder appear right main editing screen . there you select one photo edit , or drag multiple photos into photo tray bottom easier access . if you put your cursor over photo photo tray you see its dimensions size . one option i personally like ability unlock aspect ratio when resizing photo . if you ever capture photos video source , you sometimes may find photos distorted . example , people may look fat . unlocking aspect ratio allows you fix photos . warning : i tried sending slide show friend they unable open it without obtaining snapfire software . i felt i sending snapfire advertising , so won't using this feature .	-1

apple iwork software presents two applications : pages keynote which apple answer microsoft publisher power point . someone who used both , i honestly say iwork blows publisher power point clean out water . keynote some added features such 3d graphs capaibility add numbers charts ( like very limited spread sheet ) added this version . you make truly professional looking mind blowing presentations keynote make any presentation look like multimedia jewel . pages allows you desktop publishing print media finesse end results professional looking print catalogs brochures . both applications well designed , just like all ilife apps , feature classic apple interface whereby all your media content available intermeshed into work flow . there not really any new earth shattering features 06 05 version , but mainly just tweaks enhancements . far , biggest disappointment lack upgrade pricing availability users previous versions . you pay full price even if you bought iwork ' 05 . family pack version $99 really good buy you get five licensed copies versus single user copy which only gives you one installation $79 . family pack definitely way go especially if you need install more than one mac . this excellent product works really tight . i only give four stars no upgrade pricing no new applications bundled package . if you need slide show presentations front group , then purchase price worth cost keynote alone . it really rocks	-1

ratings relative other racing games . no doubt if this your thing you like this game . it not arcade game like gta or nfs but intended seems succeed simulation . several help / assists make it easier rookies . extrordinarily difficult maximum settings , but satisfying if you " dumb down " competition bit , otherwise learning curve intensity extreme . line play available but expect contend both obsessed extremely skilled components well crash happy losers . i would consider this most compelling perhaps realistic racing simulation around . fabulous 3d rendering really requires current high end hardware . using macbook pro ( xp boot camp ) it works really well . hate admit how much time i've spent playing this . way cheaper than running real race cars lot safer . works great logitech g25 . problems : missing online code available manufacturer via e-mail . starforce copy protection annoying ( requires original disk drive ) but not caused any problems i am aware	1
outstanding ! copy protection kind stinks but software itself great ! very , very realistic driving experience . on-screen performance matches true vehicle performance . many customizaton options . i end up downloading " cheat " give me more options rather than win them racing 4 cylinder econo-racers but overall experience outstanding ! i would highly recommend this software any racing enthusiast	1

i've using this piano trainer 2 months now , am up lesson 100 or thereabouts . i've spending 1/2 hour each day it , os mac midi/usb piano keyboard attached it . each day , i start my " tail " lesson , then work through all other ones up my " current " lesson . then i " tail " lesson again . if i play it computer rating me 99 or 100% , i declare i've " passed " lesson , move tail up next lesson next day . if i don't pass , i keep tail where it . other , " current " , end , i usually move up one lesson per day , unless current one particularly challenging . i also usually one " goof off/preview " lesson where i just relax try little fun next lesson beyond current one , giving myself little treat look forward . i usually take weekends off , only my lessons if i'm feeling like i want . during weekdays , i find it nice way just " something different " after day office , quickly find myself sucked ; lesson time passes quickly . system worked quite well me so far . i've stayed motivated am making definite consistent progress . program works very well most part . each lesson displays sheet music , button plays lesson it should sound . plus , most lessons video snippets instructor giving detailed examples hints . most lessons also button where you play accompanied other instruments . after you play lesson , computer rates your performance , 0 100% correct , shows sheet music where you made mistakes ( wrong notes , notes played too long or short , etc . ) . there few bugs os mac version . worst sound volume level instructor / example music can't changed . there slider this preferences window , but it doesn't work . volume stuck maximum , so it far , far louder than sound coming my own playing . other serious bug automatic lesson grader almost always indicates you've played final note lesson too short , even if you hold it down far too long ; this seems especially true if final note whole note . other bug i regularly see window pop up saying something script interpreter crashing . this doesn't seem cause any problems , but it annoying . other than , program seems solid . it uses better piano sound than one comes built-in mac ; it still isn't realistic like ones casio yamaha keyboards , but it good enough	-1

this software seems brilliant - very accurate job scanning decoding . it could improved allowing multiple page scans ( without set timer page insert)it defintely save you time . it not appear page storage/filing system like some ocr programs but 5 stars its scanning decoding . registration becomes problem if you reinstall software several times ( i redo my computer frequently ) , it not smart enough know it same machine forces you contact technical support . ms office recognise its same machine so its not hassle . if you interested document storage filing computer then other ocr might better choice . if you want accurate page scanning modification changes i would most highly recommend this software .	-1

i purchased this software 2 weeks ago , i say it far superior any other product its price range . i admit it not nearly intuitive they say it , but learning curve ( me ) isn't steep . i say some reservations , because i went school media production probably little better knowledge base work than average beginner . make matters more difficult , cakewalk products ( my experience ) always very poorly written manuals . music creator , they seem made effort improve area . it first cakewalk manual i've seen actually screenshots whatever particular topic . thank heaven small favors . avoid experiences like other reviewers apparently , i would recommend following1 . buy boxed version instead download website . yes , it ten bucks more you pay shipping , but boxed version , you get manual ( pictures , no less ) well separate cd video tutorials , plus some other extras . cd tutorials first . if you get stuck after , info help section makes alot more sense . 2 . if you don't background recording , get yourself home recording how-to book . there millions them out there , they extremely useful if you don't really understanding jargon . one thing cakewalk they say you don't any experience use their products , but somehow they assume you're familiar terminology . if you're just looking some backing tracks jam , or drag drop midi sequencing , this job , but probably alot more than you need . if you're like me looking all-in-one solution take song melody knocking around your head finished , mastered product cd or mp3 ( you don't cash protools or reason ) this might just what you're looking .	-1

acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version .

several years ago i used delorme street atlas usb gps receiver . software worked but interface lousy . this year i tried microsoft streets trips 2007 surprised find it interface smoother some ways than delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . help possibly worst i seen microsoft product ( that saying lot ) . here some problems : 1 . street trips expecting gps receiver uses ** com port ** . you kidding me ? 2007 ??? delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) work if you use delorme com port emulation software , but why this necessary ??? ( it not trivial get it work . ) 2 . handling pushpins ( identifying spots map ) , favorite places , like , extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary review , you don't re-enter information each time . you just save file reload it . ) 3 . directions sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone " turn left " if you don't know which direction they're pointing ( e.g. , when you're stationary parking lot) ? much better such cases say " head ne " or some such . freeway exits ( least so . california ) often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance identified " local road " , which time proved quite confusing . ) 4 . why doesn't software automatically recalculate directions put you " on-route " once you're off-route ? you push f3 , but why this necessary ? 5 . i never got voice providing driving guidance work . online help useless . i'm sure someone jump tell me how it , but it should trivial . 6 . general , software feel bunch modules written independently thrown together . i'm not reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find much ms software bad precisely because it feels like it cobbled together without much attention given integration . it shiny surface but shine vanishes once you really start use it . given this experience , i probably give delorme software try next time around .	-1
everything negative reviewers say true more . please note following well : 1 . if you college student taking class online uses blackboard software , vista prevent you posting class discussion board answering any fill-in-the-blank or discussion questions tests ! fix this download foxfire browser ( free ) use it access your course . because vista uses so much memory already so huge , they drop quite few little programs software needs access operating system . 2 . huge memory hard drive drain . look this comparisonwindows xp professional size drive 1.5 gig memory requirements 128 mbwindows vista needs 15 gig load . not say how large program but i wouldn't think its small !!! memory requirements 1 gig ! if you check dell website you see they recommend you 2 gig memory use windows vista . few $$$ worth memory just run operating system while openning program . try running game or doing animation kind sink hole your system ! less memory you available , slower everything , including websites load ( no matter how fast your internet connection ) what worse fix what wrong it ( ie replace all those small programs your software expects find operating system ) , they add patches only make it bigger hungrier memory ! this most pathetic excuse upgrade i ever seen . i would expect some lawsuits before this over ! not buy this product	-1
once again , microsoft proven they churn out some new schlock overnight , filled bugs , limited usefulness . greeting card section most amusing me- it prints out great looking cards upside down text beginning bottom inside card . short , cards section buggy you sink hours trying maneuver around it look solutions online . i make pc cards all time i say this program sucks . help section answers nothing , but ms gadly charge you $35 per question support . some huge sections ms works just made up links internet sites one find easily using any search engine ; i call this fatuous redundancy . loading some parts , like calendar , slow even very powerful computer . this one most useless shoddy programs i ever used my entire life . it waste space my pc used rarely if all . it hilarious they charging around $50 it . this $9.99 bargain bin kinda thing . don't buy it . my pc came it that only reason it there .	-1
teacher i use word , powerpoint , publisher when working students engaging professional activities ( presentations organizations , etc . ) i using office 2002 , thought i should upgrade . big mistake . ribbons icons frustrating scroll through , especially since i previously just customized toolbar so everything i needed immediately available . i'm still trying figure out how type chinese , although spanish german working fine . additionally , they've come up truly ugly color scheme their ribbons/icons/etc . previous commenter noted , making changes basic template creates extreme problems , i also unable get darn number bullets renumber . it took me almost twice long write test usual , i ended up doing manually what used quite easily using toolbar . designs publisher now very difficult see differentiate . previous versions , you could see stark differences different designs . current options pages , everything so soft , both line color , well so small , it hard tell what you're looking . but truly big disappointment powerpoint . their new selection slide designs all appeal rotting road kill -- i would embarrassed give presentation professional group using what available 2007 . i reinstalled my 2002 programs . i feel like i just wasted all money i spent this suite . my suggestion ? if you absolutely pc because you lot word processing , stick word 2002 or 2003 . if you need presentations/brochures/etc . your business , get mac avoid this problem altogether	-1

this worst software i bought . first , it cost $100 mcafee not honor $55 rebate because i sent rebate form little late . they only 15 days send out after purchase while compusa receipt much longer deadline send our rebate form . isn't kind trick ? second most important , it slowed down everything , not bit but dozens seconds or even more than 1 minute . third , speed not only problem , its wireless connection sucks maximum couple my machines can't get online can't connect network . i 3 pcs 1 laptop . only two machine get connected . it also conflicts belkin network card driver which so popular so many years . how hell mcafee not know adaptor ? fourth , there no manual whattsover you all figure out yourself . given it so much problem it very frustrating configure it . sometimes security center downloading forever . who hell knows what it doing . sucks . i spent so much time fine tune it it still sucks much . i changed back internet security suite which much better than this . don't buy it even they give it you free or you break disk .	-1
this first review i written probably few years . normally , i don't feel strongly enough any product , good or bad , bother entering review . this new version quicken , i something i feel strongly enough write . i using quicken close 20 years . i built all my finances around it . past 6 years , quicken going steadily downhill . this latest version , i hope , represents rock bottom . i don't see how product could possibly get any worse . words cannot describe how bad this product . no functionality added previous 6 years . what happened screen become more cluttered more links quicken " financial partners " , more redundant links other , old , program features , more white space . return , user page through tab after tab after tab view same information previously fit only 1 screen . further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas older versions screen refresh instantaneous . entering simple transaction may require this bloated sofware generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 2 seconds . means , once you hit " enter " key complete transaction , you waiting long 8 seconds before you move entering next transaction . little 3 years ago same step required less than second . obviously , time required vary your computer - but it bad enough quicken now requires you " downgrade " your quicken software every few years - it also necessary you replace your entire computer system same time just so you realize same performance level you previous version . all this no additional features or functionality . there new kid block i am switching . it called " moneydance " . it import data quicken , it fast , compact , runs any platform , windows , linix , unix , mac , even os/2 . it easier use than quicken support great . it available download - functional evaluation version free full version only $30 . you actually speak person get help w/out pay . since i using quicken years , it take while test mondeydance out make sure it works properly . i am running 2 side-by-side while make sure numbers agree . so far , things going well . then i plan dump quicken forever . well run dry quicken ; everyone who made product great apparently left company . obviously people quicken free make their product bloated cumbersome they want . but they should not allowed force people downgrade . yet , what they doing . i am absolutely positively through quicken , i am not coming back	-1

i am retired senior software engineer ( web development ) . i've used many antivirus/malware packages both work home . this absolute worst . after installing it , i got popup virus alerts bitdefender every 10 seconds . no kidding . i couldn't believe it . i previously copy norton antivirus 5 my computer which highly reliable ( not like latest version ) . i tried bitdefender based reviews below which obviously written people less than standard operating systems . i use pc windows xp sp2 ie6 ( ie7 still buggy ) . although multiple runs bitdefender show absolutely no viruses or malware my system , i continue get these popup " virus alerts " every 10 seconds when i browse internet , which way more irritating than anything norton ever my computer . addition , it drags my computer almost screeching halt when i go web page i haven't more than day , sometimes even ones i just went hour ago . i find this truly irritating went bitdefender website tried their online chat . " jack " completely worthless . he told me completely wipe out my cookies , well lot other useful files no apparent reason other than he probably not named jack , but something like vishnu this first thing long list things tell people . very useless . not recommended anyone . try get old copy norton antivirus 5 pay update feature ($20 per year ) . much better than this garbage . addition , there virtually no options customizing this product . you're stuck what they think necessary ( like automatically deleting internet files you may need -- like shopping carts ) . it literally cripples your computer .	-1
we very disappointed this product because it provides almost no options customize spreadsheet . we cannot rename catagories not applicable us ( i.e. , child care ) , we cannot create new categories specific our needs . what even more limiting disppointing you cannot create different tab each month use comparison , which makes us wonder what value we gain single month finances captured . finally , bar graphs summary comparisons shaded same color background which makes it very difficult read	-1

this software might recommended if better utilities weren't out there . this one gives user sense security , but when my system crashed , fix-it couldn't . i dutifully put rescue disk , booted up it , restored my earlier system , exited rebooted . nothing . before i'd able get into safe mode , but now nothing . so when i manually restored my system , guess which program got yanked ? it freed up lot system resources , too . ( i known how much before , alone would soured me . ) my system now runs faster doesn't lag while typing . small criticism : even though fix-it automatic update virus scans , i found more often than not i go vcom site manually download anti-virus files . no reason ever given ; i'd just get message telling me it . very inconvenient . also warning*warning : this program strict activation . you only it one computer , so forget putting it your notebook computer . finally , careful when cleaning your registry . look every entry this suite wants delete . if you run it default , it may remove critical registry keys settings . fact , i'd use different registry cleaner or some free ones . fix-it some great features , but not enough make it worth system resources system sluggish system . ( not mention anti-virus problem ) . try system mechanic instead .	-1

good grief . where i begin ? we upgraded two computers 6.0 act 2007 . prior install , we totally reformatted our hardrives clean install windows xp . we performed xp update , installed ms office basically two smokin ' clean machines - more or less brand new . then we we installed act ! 2007 expecting perfection . our problems software : 1 ) miserable , buggy installation - barely worked . 2 ) inability convert our old act 6.0 e-mail database into new version act 2007 . 3 ) slow , slow , sloooowwww performance . 4 ) e-mails delete themselves no apparant reason . this worst all . 5 ) terrible syncing palm . sometimes it works , other times it doesn't , overwrites data when it not supposed vice-versa . 5 ) useless sage tech support . don't buy this product . fact , i would never buy product sage ever again . my colleague already ditched act ! switched using palm desktop outlook express . this after losing all his e-mails . if i lose all my e-mails again - i uninstall ditch my copy altogether . i would love reclaim hours my life lost this poorly written loser program .	-1

since most complaints recent switchers i went ahead bought this because most their problems don't apply me ( running powerpc , no old data transfer ) , because intuit offers 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee . oh , i downloaded it their site , saving like 5 bucks . here thing . qfx file quicken uses get data financial institutions restricted . my bank offers download , so i get file just fine . however , part quicken import process internet check bank see if they " support " mac users . support , all really means bank pays quicken allow mac users import their qfx files . if not , you get error message saying try import again later . there hack floating around ' net invloves changing some text qfx file , it works . but there cheaper alternatives out there support format ( moneydance one ) no fuss . aside this issue , interface really bad . it looks like check register . if i wanted glorified spreadsheet shape my checkbook , i would made one . program not even close intuitive , which means if you dislike/avoid tracking your finances like me this software scare you away pretty effectively , making your purchase pointless . lastly , customer support really very bad . you basically get canned responses don't even really address questions you ask , semi-broken english . i'm sure someone banks mac supported qfx , tons patience , predisposed dealing accounting minutiae would find this program useful/powerful . me , all advanced features world don't matter if i can't even use most basic ones	-1

honestly , i don't know how much more they improve adobe acrobat . it excellent product , god-send electronic file management . i upgraded version 6.0 . only problem i 6.0 it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , files seem " print " it much more quickly than version 6.0 . i not utilize " one-button " feature it provides ms office other programs . i try keep all my programs non-integrated possible , because my previous experiences showed they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i don't come close using all features acrobat , but my needs , it far surpasses anything else i've tried ( or researched ) . if you're problems version 6.0 , or older version you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i don't foresee ever needing upgrade acrobat again	1

i used this program 5-state road trip midwest , while overall it " adequate , " it some key shortcomings . bad stuff : first , this not especially user-friendly program ; there steep learning curve operate it ease predictability . spend lot time playing this before using it primary navigator ! lot commands not intuitive , you need go through lot menus figure things out . this problem when you road looking get somewhere . it doesn't lot clickable buttons main screen . example , get program talk you , you must certain tab bottom screen . if you any other many tabs , program doesn't talk you or show you turns . it took me hours figure this out ! help function useless . second , tracking very slow , result you easily overshoot your turns -- especially when there no physical street signs many areas country -- which happened me numerous times . many times screen showed me i lot farther go before scheduled turn , this caused me overshoot it when there no sign . third , " rerouting " function awful perhaps biggest problem this program : if you stray route -- even pull off get gas -- program flips out keeps trying route you back original route even if route not easiest or most direct . i not found way it manually or automatically calculate new different route . i also found no way modify route once you begin route ( see below ) . several times several different cities , re-routing function totally wrong -- spitting out names streets weren't even screen close zoom level . this really annoying glitch , it happened without fail every time i strayed route . once off route , there no way hush program yelling you you're off route , there also no way easily program recalculate change route . when there construction you didn't anticipate , example , this program sucks able change route once you've started it . very annoying . there no construction updater plug-in , which would helpful long term construction projects go forever . fourth , program not audibly warn you if you going wrong way one way street . this actually happened me , there no " one way " signs particular street springfield , il . though there green arrows screen indicate one-way , but voice commands didn't warn me i actually going wrong way , so i not looking screen , i wouldn't known . you can't always look screen when driving . iowa i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over southbound lanes . i heading north southbound lanes ( i supposed ) but there no visual or audible indication i going wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , search function wholly lacking not easy use . i needed find police station while missouri -- no such luck . i also needed find state fairgrounds missouri ( which i later came across screen ) but it not show up when i intentionally searched it . search limitations second biggest problem this program . sixth , several times screen showed me " off route " totally blacked-out area no roads around me when i fact u.s. highway or interstate . something wasn't communicating correctly . other times screen showed me more than 1000 feet off highway even though i certainly highway . illinois , screen showed i pretty much driving through corn fields even though i u.s. route . this problem pronounced multi-lane highways . if you're not center lane , often program indicates you're off route . very annoying . seventh , zoom level not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically high zoom far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most time see all minor roads landmark indicators , but program kept zooming out every few minutes . eighth , help function joke . it totally lacking substantive information . program should come separate dvd movie showing how use it . ninth , program not recognize lot road name synonyms . example , some u.s. routes also county/state/local designation numbers and/or alphabetic name , but map often only listed one or two many " also known " names/numbers . this quite problematic when signs roads don't match up turn commands ( e.g. " turn left u.s. route 40 , " when only street signs showed alphabetic name no numbers . this also quite annoying . tenth , antenna comes program sucks . without fail , i would get red " no signal " indicator every city i where there high-rise buildings . this happened kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , springfield . if you city , you risk no gps tracking ability . yes , my antenna mounted recommended . one point i held it up through my open sun roof no success . eleventh , main-screen buttons way too small use while driving if laptop your passenger seat . you pretty much pull over or risk crashing see what you're clicking . yes , i'm aware disclaimer program states you should separate navigator operate program while driving . i'm also aware almost no one who uses this program actually navigator/operator . twelfth , trip planning lacking . when you input starting ending point , program gives you one route . there no way easily plan alternate routes or preview them . true , you things like program it not take you toll roads , but this function not easy use . several times program kept me off interstates when i wanted them , sometimes it kept my interstates when i wanted u.s. or smaller county roads ( sightseeing purposes ) . i would go off route listen program whine off route . thirteenth , i emailed list my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations folks delorme . never heard back them , which concern me quality issue . ok , so there some redeeming qualities : first , * general * gps tracker on-target . 95% my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i program operated just fine . just realize this program ( well gps general ) lot limitations , especially when there bad weather or you woodsy area or place lot obstructions . third , you easily add points interest comments yourself . i used this function lot mark places where i want return take photos daylight . fourth , there selectable function show high contrast colors ( black background bright road colors ) . this quite helpful . summation , money this program good deal , but not rely it ( or any gps program ) your * sole * source road information/navigation . if i hadn't my rand mcnally paper road atlas back-up state city maps i borrowed library , i would big trouble several times . there lot ways this program should improved , but meantime i'd still recommend it despite problems . knowing limitations i've listen save you time frustration . there no better alternative imho price . it possible some my complaints fixes , but you wouldn't know it crappy help function .	-1

after using this software week , i'm generally pleased results . learning curve not too difficult climb ; though i some prior experience less sophisticated versions this type software . box comes thick printed manual , which nice reference . index manual good but not great . unfortunately manual not comprehensive . it appears cover core functionality but not any depth its discussion " power tools " . manual appears nearly verbatim copy online help . software comes short online instructional videos -- basically animated screen captures voice-over commentary . two or three videos i've watched filled gaps manual left open . my pc 2001-era 1ghz celeron 1gb memory . it renders 3d drawings fast enough not frustrating , i limited patience this sort thing . however , i not added great amounts detail plan yet -- mostly just walls , roof , electrical , some trim . addition detail may slow rendering down enough annoying . other reviewers complained performance , but documentation hints speeding up if you run into problems . while core parts software pretty good , power tools leave little something desired . this may just lack education my part , but if so then i'm going blame skimpy documentation . these power tools almost appear developed either different groups or third parties . overall they lack polish usability part core software . take " room wizard " , example . this slick way put together interior floor plan house . problem room wizard launches almost separate application , when you're it asks " update current design " . when you say yes , it appears paste picture drawn room wizard back into main application . there , it difficult ( impossible ? ) get interior layout overlay your foundation design . i difficulty other power tools : topo designer clunky , site planner annoying lot size limitation ( no line more than 1000 ' ) , estimator won't let you add additional materials ( you put cost concrete your foundation , but you can't add fill or stone drainage ; if i manually put this stuff into separate spreadsheet then built-in estimator pointless ) . so . again , maybe this learning thing , but rest software easy figure out -- why these so different ? overall , i would give software 3.5 stars : four stars doing stuff it absolutely must very well , minus one star advertising extras don't work so good , plus star good documentation core functionality , minus half star failing document extras . ( i figure extra thirty fifty bucks cost over competing brands due these extras , but i haven't tried competition .	-1
excellent product .

my legal ofice bought this product specifically making unfillable pdf forms fillable . this feature works much better than we expected . i anticipated we would lot clean-up make forms useable . not case . 80% forms we run through it come out perfectly . it seems trouble forms really crowded fields or embedded fonts we don't access . designing fillable forms scratch used take us hours simple form . i could see most forms we use taking 6-8 hours each . running it through formtyper takes few seconds . amount time we save this one task tremendous . we also begin using ocr capabilites create digitial documents our paper files . ocr seems work really well , even multi-generation copies . we very pleased performance this product .	-1

pros : good , well contructed , colorimeter novice , easy use software walks you through every step . i notice definite improvement my new 22 " ws lcd picture . i tried adobe gamma quick gamma , but these programs rely your eyes making brightness contrast corrections , setting gamma . my eyes not sharp they 20 years ago . cons : new updated software , version 2.3 , out since june , 2006 but colorvision still shipping older version . go their website [ ... ]) , download 2.3 ( 110.3 mb ) , install it , use keycode your 2.2 version run it . 2.3 version changes target white point lcds 6500k instead native . i personally prefer 6500k anyway . gamma 2.2 6500k only choices express . if you want more choices you purchase more expensive pro version . after calibration exiting software i got " not find color profile " error message . rebooting solved this . counter-weight adjusted , i still tilt my lcd monitor back 15 - 20 degrees before i could get spyder lay completely flat screen .	-1

im computer literate regularly use number varying programs visio logic audio ms office . after picking up illustrator however , im frustrated lack intuition steep learning curve software offers . ive told world revolves around 2 types people : those who " get " vector graphic programs , those who errrr ... dont . unfortunately , after 10 hours use much manual reading , i fall into later category . i dont plan give up however plan enroll course . this decision supported friends proficient its use - but who difficulty demonstrating complex concepts me . ( indeed , defining direction drawn curve intuitive metaphsyics or nuclear science ! )so my advice this : extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before . it may breeze those well versed its use , but absoloute beginner its extremely difficult program grasp you may dissapointed find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars it .	-1
i thought this would good product my computer . i didn't know only way receive this product over internet via download . during process prompts internet download ask you remove ( uninstall/delete ) all your known antivirus , spyware , firewalls your computer prior install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive error message . i received error message prevented me completing download . i purchased software aug 3 called customer support , they researched problem even took remote access my computer try fix issue . they unable so then passed me second level computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well varying levels technical support , those know basics those know more . they asked me set up time span when i would like receive call " teir ii " agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over next two weeks , all them outside specified time . i missed several them because i career life . when i finally spoke agent they again took over remote access my computer also unable solve issue . here it , two weeks after i purchased software , i still not what i needed . i also unable surf web because download process requires you delete all antivirus firewall software . i called several times druing ordeal " teir i " agents just told me i wait call , " they'll get it when they get it . " i very upset customer support , i no idea how product , but customer support just horrible . go windows live onecare home page search " post your own thoughts " page through member accounts , you'll see i'm not alone this issue . i since purchased other software cover what microsoft says it onecare . i not one problem these installs . please aware you might purchase technical support if you cannot download due problem your operating system ( seperate onecare ) . this costs additional $35 ontop cost onecare	-1

i used ms streets trips 2005 2006 over year . it some map errors i wish updated . i read delorme street atlas far superior , so i bought it . it only took one day me find mountain problems . not only mapping way out date ( many years ) microsoft streets trips 2006 maps far more up date . many occasions told me turn wrong direction roads even when road doesn't exist direction . it doesn't even know name some very old roads displays ... " unknown name " while driving very old established roads it tells me turn onto road actually elevated overpass i am driving 30 feet below . program actually wanted me get back freeway making u-turn off ramp ramp . i used microsoft streets all these same areas it much more usable . delorme very confusing frustrating . i'm sending it back full refund	-1

i purchased quickbooks 2005 ; 4th upgrade 10 years . unlike earlier versions , this one confusing painful use . simple things like making deposits through contraptions . one reasons i upraded use online banking ; it complete disaster . it doesn't download complete trasaction details , reconcilliations very difficult . you doing twice work use it . once my transfer bank aborted message saying you low memory though quickbooks sent transaction bank , it didn't mark it internally , so next login , it sent payment again !!! it cost me $1509 double payment i am still trying get back ! how you pay bill totally messed up , there no way you mark bill paid online unless it through quickbooks online connection . ( bank billpay can't used!!)it very poor organization , you can't 2 accounts # vendor ( still 2005 !!! ) . it introduced obscure concepts items classes , which no real definition no " default " use stop every transaction . one biggest thing quickbooks hurt their customers payroll . technically you it yourself , but they hide information scare you every step you should ( must ) buy $299/year payroll service ( old tax-tables ) . all documenation , not once they mention you payroll directly this how . compared earlier products , this huge cost . reckoning i would paid ~ $2000 previous version quickbooks!!it definitely cheaper buy basic version software use accountant other work you better off . don't waste money quicken services or premium products , they bleed you death your way mental asylum	-1
i'm responsible 10 computers our organization . last year we purchased norton antivirus 2006 . it such resource hog it stopped our older computers ( 550 mhz ) working i uninstall all computers . after reading reviews said 2007 leaner , i tried install this 6 computers . only 1 install went without problems . installing three other computers took 3 days , i'm still not through computer 5 . sometimes program won't install . once it crashes during install , it leaves behind broken code prevents reinstall unless you use norton uninstall tool , which removes all norton products . so addition uninstalling reinstalling antivirus , you also reinstall norton ghost or any other norton products . computer i'm still fighting install went smoothly , but during update program hung up now i can't open norton antivirus . even worse , when i open word document , norton antivirus starts scanning document freezes computer . what nightmare	-1

new product release worthless - too buggy slow work . previous releases ok - they find some malware removed it , without interference our system . however , despite cute-sy interface , there other software programs provide same ( or better ) anti-malware support . most importantly , this company some shady business practices ( like hidden yearly automatic renewal charges , installing google toolbar download , etc ) no way contact them directly other than their online contact form which never receives response . check out better business bureau see their " unsatisfactory " report . i am currently disputing charge this company my debit card huge problems - so far i only able speak bridget their third-party billing company who says they not able provide assistance my complaint . there other , more reputable companies work . this type software not worth hassle	-1

after researching few options market i tried kaspersky internet security suite 6.0 . i needed only anti-virus but since rebates made whole suite cost same anti-virus alone i decided give it try . man , i really disappointed . out 7 programs only 2 started working properly : anti-virus proactive defense . suite trying start other 5 programs requesting reboot laptop constantly . after trying all i could i decided call or email help . this where i got my surprise - none contact information led me any live person . i emailed all addresses available net program . i called all us numbers i could - they even don't live representative here . if you try call number us canada you reach one those accept all calls leave your numbers wait all you response time . i filled out two bug reports directly program same result . one selling points anti-virus program hourly updates . well , guess what . you lucky daily update without manual interaction . i thought something wrong my work laptop installed second program ( i na�ve bought two ) brand new installation windows xp . result absolutely identical . if you don't believe me - try contact any their support ( not sales ) channels before you buy their product . my final view this product would : 1 . great idea2 . maybe great initial implementation ( reviews great)3 . unavailable support . don't waste your time money	-1
i bought this program because i wanted use it pocket pc ( dell axim x50v ) . program very confusing use . it took some time load ppc first , then you load maps . i tried load map whole state it wasn't working . map would come up gps reciever would pick up where i , but when i would write address street exists , it would say " search , no match found .

don't buy vista -- any version , yet . ms released it way too early . some examples why : * too many hardware drivers not yet available , i.e. , creative audigy sound cards ; nvidia graphics cards , linksys wireless network components , just mention few . when i contacted product manufacturers , i sensed ho-hum attitude . moreover , some peripherals totally incompatible . example : my epson perfection 1650 scanner rejected vista , so i forced buy newer model ( epson perfection 4990 photo ) . hmmmm . one wonders whether these sorts incompatibilities result more design ( purposely ? ) than insurmountable technological deficiencies . * too many vista compatible application updates not yet available . * " upgrade " versions ms vista ( versus " full " versions ) seem full bugs . soon after i installed vista ultimate , i encountered major problem ms tech support trying resolve over two weeks . it so pervasive ms outlook 2007 affected extent some its features not available . it appears during installation process , something went awry " windows event log " " event viewer . " furthermore , latest version ( vista compatible ) diskeeper 2007 pro not launch , most likely same reason . * it appears ms went way overboard security features extent paranoia . every time you click just anything , pop-up appear asking your permission " allow " it launch . very annoying , very unnecessary . it though ms adopted underlying assumption throughout development process average end user iq 85 . * ms tech support quality deteriorated substantially . most time when you call you reach someone india . albeit these people very polite , they cannot think " outside box . " nor they touch sufficiently enough nuances english language , thus impairing expeditious understanding both sides conversation . based upon my recent experience these folks , i sense soccer mom could trained ms tech support rep very little time . what i mean this : during my multiple contacts them i developed feeling they rely totally reading manuals , scripts , on-line knowledge bases . other words , they seem not able analyze troubleshoot problems independent external references . * bottom line : not purchase vista until after service pack 1 released , or whatever they happen name their first major fix-it update package . now , stay more reliable xp versions . i truly regret i discover all this hard way . it very costly more ways than one .	-1

if you look my review history , you may note i've given very few five-star reviews . i save five stars outstanding products . i believe wordperfect x3 best described outstanding . long time ago , i used word perfect . however , my earlier jobs required i use ms word , so i my best become word guru . i believe i accomplished short creating custom macros . law clerk , i started new job where wordperfect standard . so , last year i bought wordperfect 12 . first it difficult , but i bought book helped me fill blanks . ability customize keyboards fact wordperfect gives author great degree control ( especially show-codes ) , i soon able become wordperfect guru . i remembered all things i used love wordperfect . like any lover , i also learned ignore some blimishes wordperfect . ( one those blemishes behavior pushing change point document forward , which , once you get accustomed it , really nice feature . ) wordperfect pdfs two accepted file formats electronic submission federal courts . there two complaints i found work among word devotees : 1 ) ability export pdf but not import 2 ) inability cut word document into wordperfect document without creating all formatting litter word likes use . 1 . we occasionally receive pdfs we would retype able make edits . ability import pdfs ( , those authored exported into pdf , not documents scanned into pdf ) , we now able edit those pdfs . this real time saver . since pdf de facto universal standard amongst all platforms ( windows , mac , unix ) , this great improvement . 2 . formatting litter real pain deal . i never could get ms word document just import into wordperfect without headaches trying fix formatting . my solution copy portion out ms word , paste into text file , copy again then paste into wordperfect . my complaint i could not just straight paste into wordperfect . well , corel heard my cry provided ability copy just text . lone ms word holdout my office capitulated . he no more complain . great thing wordperfect fact file format its documents not changed years ( i heard wp rep say no change since 1995 ) . why should it ? everything you could want document ( perhaps barring professional typesetting ) wordperfect . there no need create new format when one you just works . this product exactly what those who come love wp expect it . i think corel good job resolving my own personal quibbles wp . so , if you're looking solid performer seeks beat competition improving itself , wpx3 representative what you're looking	1
this truly killer application comic book collectors . you get comic whole run its auspicious origins 1961 its current incarnation end 2004 , tiny dvd you carry anywhere . thrill reading classical issues all their colored glory not missed , particularly those not reprinted so far . i especially enjoyed impossible man molecule man origin stories . seeing how particular adventures ended also great fun , since i owned some comics generally undistinguished 1980s , but didn't know how things turned out . able read entire john byrne run mid-eighties spectacular . it even better than his work x-men , almost cool lee-kirby years . this so much better than essentials , since it color so much cheaper , plus it includes original ads letter pages . it also beats masterworks series not only account price , but also because it original colors . it good owning complete collection , but it take up less space hence generate less nagging mothers or wives . this must item , perhaps best price/quality ratio i ever seen . it improved ? sure . why not take advantage possibilities computers create index all characters would allow reader see all appearances character over years ? why not create index writers artists , so one may quickly get view their work ? cross-referencing next step good people marvel must working . but there no reason wait . even it , this dvd not just good enough . it great , like fantastic four themselves	1

nero 6 wonderful product , but you need get legal copy full retail version , not oem cd or cd questionable origin . this time ( april 2006 ) best place get it ahead software website ( makers nero ) .

used vista off since release first public beta , i already become familiar interface time final version came out . menu computer browsing different xp , but no less functional . i think biggest complaints i heard seem based solely resistance change . change not bad thing , many cases web browsing interface makes things much more intuitive me . many flashy effects fun play day or two , but most now turned off divert resources productivity . my computer fast enough handle it all , but i tend prefer alot overhead my processing power . utilizing system monitors , i very seldom go above 60% cpu usage , even when rendering full 3d drawings auto cad , so i would tend disagree " system hog " classification . i also tried vista ultimate slower/older machines , see some slowing down system , so best warning here heed minimum requirements . most other issues i heard seem stem driver support , there several missing drivers pretty common pieces equipment . usually beta drivers available if you take some time look , it always advisable gather your drivers together onto single cd or external drive prior beginning any upgrade . all my software worked so far , exception palmone quick install my lexmark printer companion software . vista , it solid , reliable operating system so far proven secure free any major bugs . constant updates solve little problems time goes , enhance customization features allow you tweak system get rid anything slows you down or even annoys you . overall , i would call it far more solid than any previous version windows ( including xp sp2 ) . all-in-all it easy upgrade left me very little clean-up work when it complete . those calling it " rip-off " mac osx , you've obviously not spent much time working vista or osx . there some similarities user interface , but those primarily response user feedback what desired operating system . just because ford first car manufacturer use pneumatic tire , not mean others " ripping-off " their ideas when they too began use them . capitalistic society , market demands drive product features , vista example bringing more those demands os standard pc based systems . while it not polished os some might hoped , foundation solidly laid add-ons , upgrades , enhancements security functionality come over next few years . i also feel secure knowing these upgrades service packs included price i already paid . during same time , i know i buy several upgrades my mac around $130 each . real point this : " know what you getting into before you leap . " check compatibility all your hardware software before upgrading , know what you expect when upgrade complete . if you cannot live without certain piece your total system incompatible , not upgrade til compatibility worked out . simple ..	-1
