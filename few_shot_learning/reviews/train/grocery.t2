call me traditionalist , but i prefer original , jam-filled pop tarts none overly sweet frosting top . child , i liked it right out toaster would take it me way school . this portable variation seems me like misstep outset . moment i ripped open flimsy packaging , go-tart bar crumbled out my hand onto floor . apparently manufacturers kellogg decided use same bread-like consistency they use their standard pop-tarts this bar . especially shipping aspect introduced amazon , i think this mistake since i assume whole idea behind this iteration snack portability aspect . top bar same execrable , sprinkle-laden white frosting i avoided once it introduced enhancement so many years ago . without ability toasting bar , i find little point frosting except purposeless sugar-rush . consequently , i cannot agree its description " ready-to-eat bar " . one bar , little over ounce , 140 calories , thirty which fat . even though there more fattening bars you could eat , it still excessive-sounding 140 mg sodium . i only tried " frosted strawberry " variation because it part free promotional package i received amazon promote their new non-perishable grocery line . i think i'll just stick granola bar if i get kind munchies this bar targeted satisfy	1

i thought this product reasonably good taste , but i two major issues it . first , they describe this kettle corn . it not kettle corn - not even close . this caramel corn thick sweet coating . real kettle corn slightly sweet , slightly salty popcorn . second , each very small bag 1.5 servings it . when last time you opened small bag snack food only ate 2/3 it ? they purposely made serving size unrealistic make it look healthier . whole point paying individual size bags it limits you set portion . remember when coke 1.5 servings it ? fda made them change label . if you eat whole bag , you eating 200 calories popcorn . no better bag potato chips or few cookies , so this not lesser evil - it just same old junk food new name . i won't buy this product again . it same stuff you get anywhere	-1

this great product . golden flax slightly better tasting than brown . its good enough put muffins ( us ) toppings such apple bake where you taste it . we actually consume enough justify buying it buy box . we also consume it shakes but its best when baked- works great cornbread too . we also get stone ground flours cornmeals , these three make up lot value this department . flax oil course very high short chain omega 3 . fish oils better , but if you other nutrients enzymes your body you make long ones ones flax- hence this product fulfills this need very well ( flax very concentrated short chain 3 ) . i mention it actually tastes great baked goods ? bob red mill quality product	1

i like these lot . they only slightly salty , bit molasses sweetness , all balanced against mild licorice flavor . they medium-hard very chewy , although they must kept airtight container or they get too hard . personally i would prefer stronger licorice flavor , but these still among my favorites . salty licorice indeed strange thing those who haven't tried it before . if you've never it before , don't start case ( like what sold here ) . definitely stay away double salt licorice until you've learned whether you like saltiness . if you want black licorice but don't want salty flavor , try " haribo licorice wheels " . those more licorice flavor than these coins , less other flavor . they're bit sweet bit softer . note these coins also come bags . buying them way slightly more cost-effective , but tubs might little more airtight	1

virgin coconut oil great your health taste buds . i tried several different brands . i like this one lot . i am not big fan coconut flavor , but this one smells different . it preasant . just 54-ounce jar too big . i didn't sense us unit . i recommend smaller jars if you don't bake often . you'll enjoy this oil substitution butter also you use your natural skin cream	1
these disapeared fast my house . they great granola or any breakfast cereal . they also very good plain ( but i prefer blueberries same company	1
bit more sticky not quite what i would call chocolate brownie . tasted almost identical coconut chocolate lara bar	1

if you love lemons even if you don't think you do- you love this drink ! it so crisp refreshing chilled . yes , it sugar , but what fruit juice or fruit matter doesn't ? if you don't drink soda like me kinda burnt water- try essn juices . lemon little vodka make great cocktail , too . they're little pricey , but quality products usually . it also great get it delivered my door save trip store	1
i pleased able order this bisquick mix because stores our area no longer carry it . we love these honey flavored bisquits , but hard pressed use all 22 before expiration date . i ordered them middle march they june expiration date . it would good if expiration date longer or if it given product description	1
this worth trying . i enjoy this when i need chocolate or desert haven't time bake . it yummy alone or dunked coffee . it more dense than traditional wheat biscotti so it take eating two or three before i fully enjoyed this desert or treat option . i give this ready made sweet treat thumbs up gluten intolerant	1
this awesome help relax you before drifting off sleep . i highly recommend it	1
this blend lives up its description dark , robust strong . it slight bitter aftertaste makes me want go one or two blends " lighter " , but appeal those seeking their classic morning beverage " strong jolting "	1

we've looking good french roast also fair trade preferably organic . but others we tried either not tasted we expect ( one even chocolaty -- not what we want french roast ) or just way too expensive . this one tastes like good french roast coffee should , it even less expensive starbucks i buying costco . all , organic too ! we finally found coffee we've looking	1
i love flavor this french roast , which isn't always what i go , but beans so oily , they don't grind well my burr grinder . i've found other french roast beans too , but none difficult these . maybe that why they taste better than other french roasts . overall , great , high quality coffee	1

authenic but little bland me . i add ponzu sauce taste make sure it gets really hot micriwave . if steaming when you take it out , it tastes better . pre rinsing noodles ( directed ) nonsense . just cover them good clean water ( i never use tap ) stir sauce toppings nuke it 90 seconds , uncovered . stir serve . it everyone my office drooling questions ! best price amazon , just order 2 so you don't pay shipping .	1

bran buds definitely one better bran cereals around . it actually tastes good . ( ok , it isn't cinnamon roll , but it still pretty good . ) it stays crunchy milk , but not so hard you wonder if your teeth damaged . i like combining bran buds flake cereal . bran buds my breakfast table years .	1
my local whole foods sells nature path products $3.79 box , so this amazon.com price excellent deal . cereal hearty crunchy , although it becomes soft few short minutes when submerged milk . i sometimes add little sweetner , sugar not added artificially . my housemate ( who grew up france italy ) , loves this cereal , he says it reminds him his european ' grainy ' musli-style cereals . however , i am not big fan what sold ' musli ' or ' muslix ' this country heritage bites nothing like this . think chex style bites crunch , without chex fake crunch , slimy coating , preservatives sugars .	1
they crisp , buttery yet light . unlike some other cookies , they even taste great when they broken into smaller pieces ( shipping belgium liable sometimes ) . only downside they addicting - there 24 wafers per box before you know , it time order 12-pack :-) yes , it seems like lot but if you need remove temptation - these make great gifts . you see , boxes classy most gourmet stores , each box sell nearly $6 ! ... so you also seem genuine benefactor :-) only thing wrong these cookies amazon makes it too easy obtain : -	1

wonderful product without all sugar low glicemic index	1
this best peanut butter product ever produced major american food service company . if you're expecting " peanuts salt " separated oil rock-hard refrigerated consistency after opening , this not product . if , however , you dislike most those products -- which more annoying eat than many people find worthwhile -- this what you've waiting . it uses natural tropical oil , which naturally long shelf-life , opposed disastrously unhealthy " alternative " hydrogenated oils . many people panic over seeing " saturated " , but exactly sort grossly uninformative evaluation led us using ( far more deadly ) hydrogenated oils begin -- advice which frankly unforgivable . learn fats yourself , make right decisions . i recommend " know your fats " , available right here amazon . if you want most healthy peanut butter you get , grind your own eat it fresh , congratulate yourself fantastic self-discipline patience . rest us , we need more products like this . finally , " grown-up " version american food product	1

this cereal my absolute favorite . very high fiber , low calories , but tastes absolutely scrumptious too . what more could you ask	1
my kids really go through cereal . it good buy extra boxes ahead .	1
when my mother-in-law purchased " light " rice bread , i expected it even worse than regular rice bread we tolerating . however , i pleasent surprise ! this bread much lighter than very dense rice bread made energ . it still tastes better toasted , but my 4 year old eat it straight out bag too . i am enjoying it well - so much easier use than my previously preferred brand , which pulled apart knife after storing freezer . i used make rice crumbs meatloaf , sandwiches , garlic toast , regular toast , am hoping try french toast soon - first bread even worth attempting one	1
i am one hardly ever leave product reviews , much i buy online , i should work . but , after trying various kashi products , these bars far best i feel need leave review ! i started off eating kashi honey almond flax granola bars , which very good , but definitley not sweet these ( not good or bad thing , just comparison ) . however , you still get protein , fiber omega-3s if that what you're looking . if you love chocolate almonds looking protein/fiber bar tastes good more sweet side , this definitely one try !!! whether you use them meal replacement or snack , they absolutley amazing i definitely repeat customer	1

this cereal super crunchy but it sure beats soggy soup , which what most cereals turn into after couple minutes milk . it also makes great pick-me-up dry snack when you're craving something crunchy , but don't want all calories sodium most chips/crackers/pretzels . flavor mild , kind lines cheerios , but better my opinion ( since i go through 2lb . bag heritage o week ) . whole grain , organic , low sodium , breaks all stay-crunchy records ... what else could you ask o cereal ? one word caution though . this cereal may cause those close complain crunching noise you emit while eating it	1
really enjoying it ! we tryed both raspberry blueberry me it no comparison - blueberry rules ... i'm struggling drinking less soda increasing tea . after i " cold " brewed glass added some sweetener few cubes , i fell love . glad i ordered enough get start spring , summer grilling ! if you like berry flavored beverages , give ice cool brew tea , blueberry try .	1

i grew up kraft boy , you wouldn't find me off-brand boxes macaroni cheese . no , sir . just authentic best me . when i got older , i realized ( thanks mark bittman superb cookbook , how cook everything -- if you happen vicinity bookstore , pick it up ) boxed stuff horrid , compared making actual pasta actual cheese . but , well , sometimes i just want something out box . ( our seven-year-old always , he insane tasteless taste buds child . ) those cases , i always went back kraft , until we started shopping whole foods bought pack annie try out -- very skeptically my case , i'd lot off-brand stuff failed live up kraft ideal . even so-called " premium " " deluxe " stuff like velveeta shells cheese just totally weird off-putting . but , heresy heresies , it turns out annie stuff actually better than kraft . both regular box powder , this stuff cheese-gel , taste better than kraft , through some feat food science alchemy . try ' em out . personally , i give nod deluxe over regular , just because it twice easy make ( no mixing milk , butter , powder -- just rip pouch mix noodles ) , " easy make " pretty much whole point boxed food ; but it lot more expensive , so if you're price-conscious willing put forth bit effort , get regular annie . ( or , better yet , get bittman book , learn make pasta sage parmesan same price just much work ...	1
annie deluxe macaroni cheese comes pouch cheese sauce , which tastes better than any dry powder variety it quicker mix . regardless how thoroughly i mix cheese powder , milk butter , dry powder varieties not taste good annie deluxe . our 3 year old really enjoys annie deluxe i feel better offering her this rather than kraft macaroni cheese . even if taste wasn't good kraft , i would choose annie since ingredients natural some organic . kraft uses artificial color their dry powder macaroni cheese , though i don't think they their deluxe version . kids ( adults ) don't need artificial colors ! i would give annie deluxe 5 if they would reduce sodium content make deluxe version included whole wheat pasta all organic ( currently only some dry powder versions all organic ) . while i am creating my dream version , i would give annie 10 if they would enrich it some calcium other vitamins make whole wheat bunny shape version ! :) my big hangup sodium too high ( like all other brands ) . it would still taste great lot less salt ( if kids not given high sodium first place , their taste buds don't crave it ) . unless pasta whole wheat ( or other whole grain ) , there isn't much nutrition it , so whole wheat pasta enriched way go ! annie offers many varieties include some improvements i am looking , but it would great if they would include them all one version . boxed macaroni cheese truly junk food no matter who manufacturer , but annie doing great things make it better . knowing macaroni cheese often " kid food " reason enough improve it nutritionally . price reasonable amazon walmart , however most grocery chains wholefoods charge too much ! best price i found annie home website when they offered 25% off free shipping	1

i've always wanted try gourmet salts , but didn't want risk spending money case i didn't like them ( or they ended up all tasting just like regular salt ) . dave gourmet offers great way try six varieties , all one convenient shaker . amazon offers these salts three-pack , making them good value . each salt really its own distinct " flavor " . warning : eurasian black salt very strong sulfur odor taste ( i used it successfully tuna salad recipe place hard-cooked eggs ) . smoked salt just name implies : salt crystals natural smoke flavor , excellent giving indoor-cooked meats just-grilled taste . other four salt varieties milder tasting offer nice change standard table salt ( hawaiian red salt really liven up look bland-colored dishes , such pork or potatoes ) . keep mind gourmet salts work best when sprinkled foods after cooking ( heat alter taste little ) . i highly recommend this product	1

i'm usually wary food billed " all-natural , " often means " tastes kind gross weird consistency mouth feel , " but i decided if i didn't like these , i could leave them office , so i ordered them anyway . fortunately , they're very good , chewy sweet without overbearing . it good alternative those super-tiny breakfast bars - it not filling , but it not insubstantial , either . one or two these , yogurt , cup coffee or tea could enough , especially if you're not into eating much breakfast . otherwise , it makes very nice snack . only downside i got these 11/21/06 , expiration date stamped first one i tried 12/10/06 . i plan eating two day , so i should run through 24 quickly enough , if you're feeding family , it won't problem , but if you're just getting them yourself plan only eating them every now then , you may end up few go stale or expire . it just something bear mind when ordering them , so you don't order too many once then them go bad you	1
i'm not ashamed admit it ... i like my rice pudding creamy decadent . my first batch this right texture , but i found taste somewhat lacking . it " sugar water " quality it , not very creamy all , despite fact mix contains milk ingredients . so next batch , i substituted 1% milk water , result much more satisfying --- thicker , richer , more pudding-like . i also made mine double boiler , which i would recommende . takes slightly longer cook , but you're much less likely scorch product . i think it makes thicker pudding also	1

dieter who couldn't eat whole package day must eating these tasty little gems one one , break inbetween each bite . not my family . we would each take handful snack , before we knew it , bag empty . but enough bag . these things tasty provide concentrated strawberry punch flavor which makes " strawberry flavored " items taste lame . these , you get whole range flavors strawberry , sweet without too sweet , none acidic taste you sometimes get underripe berry . dried fruit very crunchy , without any gumminess shows manufacturer removed them dehydrator too early . my only beef price , although i understand why they so expensive . when i dried fruit , it took many pints cleaned , stemmed sliced berries come up respectable amount food . my family always finished one batch long before next before next ready . when i consider effort involved , these snacks probably underpriced . but it still hurts see expensive packet gone before commercials over	1

i wanted give these soy crisps more justice than just 5 stars ( ordering them all time ) . i bought bag these sea salt flavor crisps bag bbq crisps month ago , bid eat more healthy food . i've always loved bbq chips , especially ruffles lays k.c. masterpiece chips , but they've got killing me slowly , right ? so i busted open bbq soy crisps gagged . how could this bbq ? they tasted like cardboard , i gave them my friends who eat anything . i begrudgingly opened sea salt bag , though more palatable , i still disappointed .

" it gets better . ) anyway , i sworn off chips midday snacking , so two weeks i saw nothing counter but genisoy soy crisps . i'd eat two or three here there , when i ran out , i bought 2 bags sea salt flavor again . what happened must akin rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive -- my body forgot what those strong bbq flavored chips like , i started craving soy crisps . i began taste delicious roasted soybean flavor , like those roasted salted soy beans they sell jars , which i completely missed before , apparently because it wasn't sweet , red-crusted , overbearing bbq powder . i polished next bags off three days . now , i'm ordering 12 here amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems want punish my wallet trying eat healthy food ) . my advice this -- give these soy crisps chance , but don't mix them your regular doritos bbq ruffles or you'll think they're awful . stop eating , month , oily bbq chips deadened your taste buds years reboot your taste buds these markedly healthier chips . you'll feel better snacking	1

beyond glaring fact most their products aren't tomatoes , this one blight just tomatoes ethos . " just . " but it two ingredients . it not " just " anything if it includes both bananas strawberries . they don't call cracker jack " just peanuts , popcorn , high fructose corn syrup . " nor it " just " something when it comes package 2 . they don't call variety pack cereal " just grains high fructose corn syrup . " just tomatoes folks deserve credit their aspirations purity but this just goes beyond it . it goes against mimalist reductive concept absolutely roccoco . it just not right	1
i love granola cereal general , but i say this very best granola i ever . people bear naked philosophy i love , which back every bag : " we believe food should hand-made wholesome natural ingredients you actually pronounce . " although i eat processed food , i appreciate appeal more traditionally prepared foods , this granola tops list nutrition taste . like most granola , it high calories fat , but take note fat comes largely nuts contained ( it also contains expeller pressed canola oil ) , it no trans fat , only 1.5 saturated fat per serving . this cereal softer than most granola , though not soft enough me consider it chewy . it large chunks nuts also contains cranberries flax seed , optimal nutritional digestive health . six-pack sold amazon makes price per package reasonable ( ingredients quite expensive ) , so value proposition , i think this not only great product , but great buy . delicious nutritious : great combination i recommend highly	1

my kids love their macaroni cheese but one day all we generic brand . they didn't eat it all well ( kraft really best ) so i decided try make it little better them . follow recipe box couple exceptions . put one slice velveeta chees while melting butter ( i melt butter while noodles draining so melt butter velveeta faster ) add 1/3 cup milk . what you'll less expensive version really creamy macaroni cheese kraft sells lot more money . adding extra milk cheese they're even getting more calcium . my kids love it when i throw hot dogs even peas so feel free throw other things since it so cheesy ( extra cheesy sauce take things like peas kids don't normally eat make them taste good ) . give it try see what you and/or your kids think	1
this " optimum power " breakfast cereal contains wheat , oats , barley , soy , flaxseeds something nature path calls " kamut " which look like puffed oats . also there freeze-dried blueberries , few anyway , delightful subtle cinnamon flavor hits you . ingredient list contains few other things probably good you . now third ingredient 16-ingredient list - these lists supposed order according percentage largest first - something called " organic evaporated cane juice " . now what but organic sugar ? this probably accounts cereal somewhat sweet , reviewer noted . but it nowhere near sweet those tooth-decaying , empty-caloried , mass-marketed cereals most americans feeding their children . no , this cereal well within tolerance us " granolas " who don't dowse everything sugar , ketchup supermarket mayonnaise . ( no , i don't mean cereal . just making point . ) so when you pour this out box , you see lot extruded , elongated brown rod-shaped thingies , quite few healthy-looking chubby flakes , some those exploded oat-looking morsels probably kamuts here there desiccated blueberry . gawd , when i get started writing like this , i can't stop , i just get more so . better not review anything else tonight . you'll never want eat this . actually , my description thingies could far more graphic devilish . you'll see . please try this cereal , you'll like heartiness , cinnamoniness ( new word ? ) relatively light sweetness . i give it five stars , didn't i	1

first things first , you not treated classic ' cooking ' smell . fact , your appetite better off not catching whiff magnesium-salt concoction heats your meal . think happy thoughts , oblivious . why ? because meal itself actually pretty good ( airtight separation ' oven ' ) . package also includes plastic spork , knife , napkin . basically , ingredients on-par what you would typically find canned stew ( similarly need not refrigerated ) . however , meal loses one star because serving size fairly small . 210 calories isn't whole lot go , particularly if you must engage strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions . pros : lightweight , keeps well , cooks itself , easy disposal , tastes good . cons : cost storage space per calorie somewhat high . if you creative , you might able figure way cook something else using box oven	1
