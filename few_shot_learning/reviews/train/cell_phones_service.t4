my motorola c139 net10 crashed me . i called net10 they promptly sent me out new phone , except they sent me this flip phone ( v171 ) . i liked my candy bar phone didn't want this flip piece junk . i happy net10 service up point my old phone failing , then things quickly went downhill . net10 would not transfer my number replacement phone , even though i minutes available old phone . i gave my wife v171 use took back her our cingular phone , which works awesome no problems . she problems all time v171 . she always type area codes all numbers dialed , even local numbers . she also problems trying dial number phone would not dial after pressing all numbers phone hitting send . my opinion , v171 completely worthless . overall , i am very dissatisfied customer . my recommendation stay away this phone this service . go shop cingular all great deals they	-1
i agree " it too good true " statement this package . material used earbud charger really cheap !. charger melted car after sunny day , i couldn't even test it . earphone quality not good well , giving constant humming noise . case best out these three so far . so one out three 10 bucks . i am not recommending anyone buy this item .	-1
i looking forward speck rubberized cover some excitement , however i disappointed . while cover fits very well it may work industrial environment , after first day it looks like it two years old . if you sd card your treo forget it -- belt clip pop your card daily . belt clip itself afterthought easily sliding off your belt . don't even think putting treo your pocket non-slip cover won't begin slide into your pocket . finally , price $32.95 outrageous $5 cover . if you're industrial enviroment this may your cover , but rest us ... keep shopping or buy insurance	-1
i sprint almost 10 years , all told . i picture mail account them 3 years . just recently , without any warning , whatsoever , they deleted over 500 my precious pictures my picture mail account ... pics accumulating many which safely soundly sitting there most period time . most these pics very important me now lost forever . ( i only backed up 45 them . ) i guess it my own fault trusting sprint , but they offered no real explanation when i tried pics recovered , not only could they not , but they said they no record me ever picture account i them almost three years !!! this worst thing any service company ever me ! so , my advice : don't trust sprint !!! again , this happened any warning ! it could happen you too ! trust me : avoid sprint all costs ! i should	-1

i got this cyber monday $20 too . i thought i couldn't go wrong $20 . well , i wrong -- it twenty dollars completely wasted . i'd feel bad giving this pos away ... i could not get thing stay put , boom mike so bottom-heavy it won't stay close my cheek even sitting still ! it pokes out 3 feet side my head ( it seems like it anyway ) if i am moving around all ! almost like it designed get far away my voice possible . but even holding stupid thing my hand not help sound quality . i got constant complaints i could not heard very well . there only couple things saving this 1 star rating . first , i only pay $20 it . second , it decent quality , just piss-poor design . three , i liked when i clicked button ( not due incoming call ) , it automatically launched voice dial menu , so i could really make call without ever touching my cell phone . i guess one perks same mfr both headset phone . but it fails miserably it primary design goal , so i heartily recommend staying away this product	-1

great concept : protective rubber skin protects blackberry unit accidental drops scratches . rubbery material tends collect all sorts dust lint . it very hard get it off ( unless you wash it water or use tape peel it off ) . protective cover doesn't fit around screen too well . mine tends stretched out little more left side than right ( even if i try reposition unit itself ) . plastic screen cover ( removed ) already scratched due way it packaged . all all , i am pretty disappointed ... mainly because i paid over $33 it . it now sitting my desk work collecting dust	-1
i enjoyed using this phone some time . it functional , it felt solid , it nice low profile look . however , after around year half , continued act opening closing phone caused hinge crack , gradually break off completely . i now hold phone together my hand while i talk , which extremely awkward . this especially frustrating given rest phone so well made . furthermore , it seems unfortunately failed just before my " upgrade " opportunity ( couple months ) , right after my purchase some extra accessories ( batteries/chargers ) . search around online " a670 hinge " you find lot other people problems like mine . this itself wouldn't problem if samsung would willingly replace phone . however , they not claiming it design defect , neither samsung nor verizon offering replace it . bad form both , although perhaps verizon isn't much blame . i would avoid both samsung this phone because this incident . this phone seemingly designed durable , but it frankly not meant long haul , too pricey given its average performance .	-1

when i recieved this item , i mixed emotions product . one hand , black finish looked very nice , clear plastic covering protected screen but still easy read . also , all side buttons fairly easy reach average-sized fingers ( except maybe camera button ) , so navigating phone cover still closed pretty easy unless you need use touch functions or open qwerty keyboard . however , due padding nature metal materials , case very thick bulky - when using belt clip , phone sticks out far enough it not even rest evenly your hip , but leans angle . but , deciding factor my two-star rating this case cause only two times i dropped my cingular 8525 ( which such steep price , not something i like drop ) . problem lies snap-shut system closes case . because metal so thin , it not secure very well , come open pretty easily . fix this , i simply bent piece metal downward towards phone , so it much harder both open close case . this , most part , solves problem , but it still dangerous caution definately order . my favorite thing this case you open case slide keyboard open without actually taking phone out case . this nice because it enable quick replies text messages . this only reason i not give it one-star rating . i am currently looking soft case , preferably leather sleeve case i just pull my phone out off my hip , rather than bother clip anymore . final warning - careful if you buy this case . plus , i seriously not believe it worth its steep price point	-1

prior buying this phone i heard lot people say motorola hardware very good , but their software left lot desired . nonetheless i decided try this phone out when it came time start new cell plan . i made decision switch t-mobile this looked like one best phone options . right off bat i found out people who criticized moto software right money . there host poorly designed software aspects this phone , not least which -- frankly -- idiotic way phone book designed . eventually i made peace all things i disliked v360 since least it seemed work well enough phone . time went i started noticing i missing lot calls . phone would my bag or my pocket or sitting my desk when suddenly it would ring voicemail notification message i received anywhere minutes hours before . during course last few months ( phone less than year old ) i've also found it begun crashing . lot . opening or closing it result " white screen death . " putting it charger cause it switch back forth messages it charging , it unable charge it sim card cannot found , after few minutes which it simply shut itself off . full battery charge it continually shut itself off . this point i am forced conclude this phone absolute piece junk . i am also forced conclude it isn't only model which . none my coworkers ever good experience motorola phone . my wife motorola shown its own host problems . people working t-mobile several stores i visited confided they never , ever recommend motorola phones anyone . fact i've t-mobile employees urge me not buy any phones them , but rather shop unlocked nokia online . so that what i'm going . until i buy new phone all i recharge this phone every night , restart it five or six times day , keep apologizing my friends , family employers always missing their calls	-1

i think logitech make best accessories . i camera , fancy dinovo bluetooth keyoard ..... so naturally this headset no brainer . reason i got it use it my computer setup opposed looking like dork walking around public . it worked my dell 9200 laptop fine skype however it not work my dell 8400 desktop using logitech bluetooh hub . don't you find strange ? aside , it also not work my sony ericsson phone ( can't remember model ) . addition , it really hurts my ears .. not most comfortable .... so you decide if this product works you .	-1
i originally purchased logitech mobile freedom headset but when clip goes behind your ear broke , logitech exchanged it mobile traveller . unfortunately , this one not comfortable all . i agree others after 30-45 minutes , it feels like your ear vise . it true . it hurts . sound quality very good . people say they hear me just fine , i hear them just fine . but it also disconnects my cell phone when it not use . what good ? then when phone rings , i don't hear it . then clip broke this one well . logitech again replaced it . but how long this one lsat ? yourself favor skip this one	-1
i ordered motorola razr v3 mauve phone ( unlocked)a month ago . i hoping get color i saw web page ... that where problem lies . image shown completely misleading . phone i received , mauve but different one picture shown amazon web site . mauve phone i got grayish dull mauve not pretty pinkish mauve advertised . also , phone 2 different color tones . night/in lighting night , top part phone(the part flips open ) its corresponding part back phone looks completely gray . needless say , i spoke customer service sent phone back exchange . i didn't pay shipping charges . 2nd phone came same color problem again , so 2nd time i returned it got my money refunded . i gave 1 star due customer service provided , but again they could not help me . some one said it could item defect .... but methe whole experience disappointing . if you ready spend so much this phone its because brand , ' color ' which you never get because amazon put wrong image web page ... very misleading wrong all customers . incidentally , this color seen offered verizon they call it ' pink ' , but amazon calls it ' mauve ' , though phone image shown not match . so stay away ordering this pretty mauve phone ... all you get loads disappointment your time wasted .	-1

i reluctantly bought this phone because my kyocera slider suddenly died me conveniently 3 months after vm warranty up i just purchased $20 phone card + airtime credits which not refundable . now i am not teen my phone things not receive harsh treatment . my kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died no scratches what-so-ever so i pretty upset . after multiple calls 2 emails vm it pretty clear they weren't going anything help . i offered replacement slider $20 . obviously i didn't want same one could possibly die me after couple months so like i saying i no other recourse but purchase this audiovox 8610 . way after i purchased phone local store town ( when i called activate phone)they nerve tell me i could've purchased same 8610 them discount price $24.99 because slider died . ! @%ng idiots ! hello could ya not told me sooner ??? after i spent $50 + tax . sheesh ! anyway back phone review .. ringer indeed low others reported here . its so low if its my purse i can't even hear it ! wtf ??? also battery life sucks , no sooner thing ring batteries half . it also doesnt get good service vm/sprint network , my slider xcellent service w/it despite everything rarely if ever dropped calls . so i've it 5 days i'm considering attempting bring it back where i purchased it . however i don't want buy expensive phone vm because i'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them . way i see it vm leaves alot desired quality phones they sell + they expensive . i am lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise . prior these issues i happy vm customer but not anymore .	-1
bought cell phone battery this company it defective died one week after their return/replacement deadline . shouldn't cell phone battery last longer than month ?? they refuse refund or replace . they shady company i'll never business them again warn others same	-1
i bought this because my 8525 eats batteries it nice one charging while i'm using other -- you don't tied wire charge your phone . so i also bought one boxwave batteries 8525 . well , spare battery charger charge boxwave battery just fine , but it refuses charge battery came my 8525 . this really limits its usability off-line charging device . cradle itself plugs into usb port phone , which not designed cradling mind , so it not easy get thing lined up use actual cradle . since camera button bottom phone ( who idea anyway ? ) it almost always gets pressed while i'm wiggling phone or out cradle . this just bit nuisance it just means you quit camera application every time you put it or take it out docking station . anyway , just my opinion , but it actually easier connect standard usb charger phone than it put it cradle , so i'd recommend save your money just sticking standard usb charger . if you really want all charging off-line you may need buy two boxwave batteries instead just one	-1
when i first received items they didn't work them i returned spend more money they still don't work . i even computer specialist work try they couldn't even get them work . i sent them e-mail receive my money back , because i didn't want keep spending money send items back don't work back . who would guessed , but they never replied . thanks waisting my time money . i never buy any you again inform others beware	-1

i got rid bulky i355s end our contract bought two these our account . we return first phone ( line1 ) within days getting it it would randomly shut off ( crash ) , other times volume would fluctuate its own . exchanging it ordeal sprint - they charged me replacement phone still haven't credited my account after two billing cycles . few months later now second phone ( line2 ) crashing . i'll make call hang up - it shuts off . other times it shut off middle call . other night i went charge it it said invalid battery - so i took battery out put it back . then it said " invalid charger . " i might go back i355 , it rugged , reliable ( but large ) phone . i guess i'll haggle motorola getting this one fixed/replaced	-1
i've my headset month now . noted reviewer , this headset not come any buttons or switches - only thing cord shirt clip . 6 different ear gels included accomodate different ears , which nice ( though i've only ever used one ) . headset very easy slip into my ear ( only takes 1 second ) comfortable up 2 hours wear ( which point my ear starts get little sore ) . my boyfriend reported similar experience other headsets use ear gels . if you regularly stay phone longer than 2 hours , it something keep mind . however , it suits my needs just fine , low price , i think it really great buy	1
my perception headset very confortable use clarity my voice fine . i use headset all day without any discomfort . i higly recommend it over other types headset	1

phone great . you check all specs online other posts . you'll see they're awesome . my experience ... pros : - lots features- slick phone ... i care how my gadgets look like . - camera resolution pretty good . cons : - hard find good case . i'm still looking good one . one i got , my phone slip out it once while . - if you bmw want bluetooth it , fugget'boutit .... althought it not really phone fault , but bmw ( i've read other msg boards ) , it quite frustrating me when i tried hook up my new phone my new bmw ...	1

i owned one these three months , then it started fall apart . it $30 best buy . i haven't replaced it , $30 * lot * . $10 ? i'm buying two more . i moving 20 mph my bicycle , talking someone , no problems . it far better sound quality than my ' backup ' , which jabra no boom . ear volume adjustable my phone , i'm wondering what phones other reviewers won't let them adjust volume	1
these work great keeping earbuds comfortably place while allowing one hear others speaking , say grocery store . course they not provide audiophile quality sound , but they're great listening podcasts while doing shopping . only downside they bulky so not fit any earbud holder while not use . taking eargels off store earbuds off possible but difficult enough annoying	1
i purchased pink razr cingular service couldn't happier . i it month no problems all . i am very happy it . t-mobile not very good service my opinion why i chose cingular	1
i this almost 6 months i like it lot . right off , it looks great . black leather , blue piping going around edge . blue vivid color one those exotic/expensive fish tank fish : neons or tetras ? whichever it , it very sharp looking . i keep i860 cell phone ' glove all time . it not add much bulk/size/weight phone . it fits it , after all , like glove . when i am taking photo , i simply unsnap half flip-up half my cell phone which where camera lens , take photo , slip it back . before i used know this , i used press down little strap it would get way , like wayward lock hair . turns out futzing strap unnecessary . they designed it so you just remove half case , take photo(s ) , snap it back . smart . fact , reason strap there first place so you easily remove other half . look what end strap before you curse it , guys . it snap ! snaps unsnap ; what they . glove well named . it makes phone much easier grip your hand . i easily pivot it around my hand , flip it around , pick it up , basically not expect it skid around . without ' glove , you bare metal or plastic case . smooth looking - well , maybe too smooth something small costing hundreds dollars ! i like fast release belt hook . so far , it not failed me . i think it bottom , not back way some people said , but i cannot remember certain . i know it goes off easily me but never come off its own yet . i don't use it way much though . i860 not much bigger than one those little matchbox cars 1960s . i easily fit it my pocket . glove , i know it probably not going get scratched too easily	1
this headseat pretty neat when you're road or just relaxing work . it easily switches media player handsfree headset when you get call also controls pause/play answer/hangup features . comfort ear budds could little better , but stereo sound great	1
this really cool phone many features . unfortunately , you could not use some these features u.s. one thing i not understand why unlocked phones so expensive us retailers charge much more price . its price just 429.99 nokia web page . phone gets 5 stars but retailer price gets -2 stars .	1
if you don't use this phone , it costs $3/month . normal hours til 9 p.m. it 12 cents per minute , which bit less than half what most prepaid phones cost . perfect my occasional use locating family members when i'm transit feel i simply must know where they what they doing . i don't use cell phones much , but if i must one , i might well one doesn't make me worry huge bill . kids who think they mangle budget , forget it cuz when card used up -- that it kiddo . once they use up card , only number they dial 911 , but that it . bonus features : clock always accurate it great alarm which tells me when get up go work tell me when go home end day . some point , i might not able live without this .	1
i this motorola v171 year now i absolutely love it . features so easy understand . customer service reps net 10 wireless very hard understand . this phone net 10 wireless phone . net 10 wireless subsidiary tracfone . i would this phone anybody looking prepaid cell phone plan . i love it because only limited time you get 300 minutes free upon activation your phone . i would also strongly recommend if anybody purchases this motorola activate it [ ... ] its whole lot easier than calling	1
i use this all time . it gives good protection , ease use , good handling . only disadvantage you not keep it when putting unit vetical dock . however , this true any protective skin . outstanding product .	1
when i first got this , it not look like it big enough my phone , but soon i opened package put my phone it i could tell it perfect fit . i really like clear window , which i not my previous case , now i see who calling answer my phone without take it out case every time	1
provides great protection treo , but add noticeable amount thickness , making it more bundle	1
i'm not really gadget guy , what gadgets i get pretty beat up . when company gave me treo 650 so i " stay touch " , i needed least take care thing . so , i bought this skin speck products . its absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches . i'm minimalist , treo 650 skin perfect ! cool look , not bulky . easy access buttons . they their homework this product . must anyone who owns treo 650 . i also see they these blackberries	1
when i bought my motorola v220 , my cingular store charged top dollar car charger - they sold out . i thrilled when i found this starter set amazon . car charger compatible v220 , it comes case hands-free ear bud - all less than i would paid charger alone . ear bud not best sound - voices come across somewhat muffled , though still audible - case adequate . i wouldn't buy this set specifically those items , although they both work with/fit v220 . i see it , they bonuses purchasing charger . five stars charger , three rest	1
i really like this phone .. its cute , its little , its perfect young woman . i pocket pc prior this it so complicated just making call . i wanted something simple , wasn't mp3 player ( i ipod ) , wasn't professional camera ( i nice digital cam ) , or pda ( i palm tx ) ... its just simple cute . its bluetooth compatible ... although doesnt work great my bluetooth , but i'm not sure if its headset or phone .. ** ringer it super quiet ... almost point you barely hear it your purse . i'm grown accustomed " listening " vibrate feature instead . i like how you put person picture next their name your contact list . i wear it back pocket my jeans its comfortable . sound quality good , both endsi dig it . im sure you too	1
fits cell phone well seems secure . i like catch holds it belt keep it slipping off belt when sitting dow	1
i purchased this phone replace my land line not disappointed . i haven't used all functions yet ( downloading music ) , but haven't any problems anything else . here some pros cons : pros1-colorful/clear display2-good volume ( ringer volume loud enough i hear callers just fine)3-easy menu navigationcons1-no shortcut get main menu ( keep pressing " back " button)2-battery access ( it really hard take casing off get battery sim card-could good thing though)3-on/off button ( it very small-basically use my fingernail )	1
i'm quite happy this car charger . it much faster than old one i used earlier ericsson cf388 . quite simply , it what supposed	1
easy snap it wont come off easy like others . protects well not hinder any functions	1
this cover great , it provides buffer scratches absorbs some trauma phone if dropped . it isn't soft leather so if you want protect your razr you might want consider shield	1
this case pretty good snaps sec it not too bulky . come belt clip if u need i	1
this great product . it actually fits into my ear properly i hear clearly through it . it easy operate charge last many days . i would recommend this product anyone who looking earpiece fits comfortably just right size	1
i motorola h300 before ... this leaps bounds better . sound quality both units great but i'm impressed weight this lg unit . it like comparing stones feathers ( bit exagerated but you get point ... ) . this lg unit also protruding ear bud , which sits snuggly my ear . motorola unit didn't ... which often dangled swayed like last apple tree right before it falls . caused discomfort i tilt my head bit keep unit against my ear . new lg , i no longer look like i stiff neck while i'm driving	1
it fits great but doesn't cover corners phone ... kinda point case . seam top ear piece sharp stabs your ear if not careful . bolt back not removable so if you not plan use belt clip you're stuck it sticking out your pocket .	1
use it every day , it nice connector just what it says it . all treo/palm connectors , you need make sure contacts clean get good connection . wiggling connector where it meets treo usually enough it work me	1
this nice cellphone . i got it local cellphone shop . free only 1 year contract . eventually prices free like motorola razor v3 . small phone i like mp3 player mode :	1
this holster holds v220 securely place . only problem might it hard pull it out holster without flipping it open thus answering phone .	1
i'm long-running virgin customer , but additionally i work developer mobile industry , so i've experience using literally scores handsets every imaginable carrier ( including non-us ) . previous virgin phones i've used include vox 8610 kyocera 2255 . my 8610 still works , but it bit bulky heavy my tastes i decided upgrade . let start positives : -very compact design . this probably cheapest phone its size/capabilities available anywhere . it so thin when i put it same pocket my wallet , i sometimes forget it there . -for cost , it pretty decent terms features . 128x128 screen fullscreen graphic support , 10 mb downloads ( 32 total ) , speakerphone , web capability , comparable performance most nokia series 40 devices . very long battery life , fast charging . those trouble battery i suggest you try turning off backlight . it might ... interesting ... effects . -uses sprint network . i've found this very reliable my area , signal quality excellent both outdoors . -call quality good . comparable 8610 far i tell , which also good ( my old kyocera , other hand , garbage ) . -ui solid , standard design . predictive text included messaging . phone graphics bit odd , but not necessarily bad ways . -durable . utstarcom knows how build last . this handset no exception . -good library games , ringtones , graphics available . now i actually something spend all balance ... -virgin very low cost provider . it no good if you want video demand , 3g , or whatnot . but just making calls/texting now then , you simply can't beat $20/3 months . no annual contract well , which huge plus ( many who've one know all too well ) . downside : -keys bit small . this typical ultra-thin handsets . they bit stiff well , which good bad ( good because you won't accidentally press them easily , bad because typing more pain ) . -virgin web browser lame . their web service costs extra , it problems viewing many page formats ( says ' network gremlins ' when you try ... cute ) . you browse basic html , that it- good luck reading e-mail it . -no bluetooth built-in , though this expected . -no camera either , also expected . this actually good thing , since camera phones off-limits more areas than you might expect . bottom line : this handset great price . there flaws it , any phone , but pluses outweigh minuses . i've seen many reviewers complain both virgin phone , but my professional opinion ( it expert opinion ) these people need realize you get what you pay . this isn't $200 samsung t519 , you're not paying $60 month service 2 year contract . considering costs , slice great handset excellent service ,	1
two week reviewi got this phone use phone am very happy it . i it two weeks now so this early review . first , qualifier . i nice canon camera don't want use my phone take pictures . i don't want use my phone listen music or surf internet either , i just want it make receive calls maybe text here there . if you one those people different agenda your phone , then this probably not phone you . goodsize great . this phone comparable hershey bar thickness width , but shorter . it fits my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky . it makes razr feel thick , but i am guessing it comparable slvr . slice good sound quality such small phone . it also good reception . sprints network not best my area , but my slice able connect wherever i am maintains strong connection even 1 bar . when i car , road noise got too loud hear , but when i hit speakerphone button i could hear fine , keep my hands wheel . virgin definitely most affordable option if you not planning use phone lot . i expect spend $150 $200 this first year , including $50 up front phone . cheapest monthly plan big carriers would cost me least 500 over same period local taxes fees included . although i haven't tried them , it looks like monthly plans virgin pretty reasonable too if i start getting into kind usage level . many other virgin phones look like toys . although this ones name sounds like toy people under 18 recognize it , it also looks like real piece equipment . older professional i am not embarrassed plop this phone conference table meeting vp . ( vibrate mode course ) same time , my 12 year old hoping i hate it get phone so he this one because it so cool . ui well designed easy navigate except ridiculous menu . what they smoking when they decided use pig " my account , " dragon " messaging , " etc . other than , features all where you would expect them navigating menus quite intuitive . can't really comment reliability this phone after just two weeks , but it already dropped twice still works fine . badperhaps because they affordable other ways , virgin screws you ringtones background . four ringtones included unacceptable , you blocked up or down loading your own . they pretty big collection their website you get $2.50 pop , but none them sound like phone . included wallpapers chosen most despicable choices possible too , so you likely fork out $2.00 wallpaper their web site well . buttons little too small . most time i fine , but every once while i hit two keys or wrong key because they so small . course once numbers all loaded into contacts speed dials set i haven't run into problem any more . battery life not lived up what i read , but might because how i use it . if i charge it every night i am fine . i ordered extra charger keep office one car well just case . summaryafter two weeks i am happy this phone would recommend it someone looking phone use making phone calls . it not big extras like camera , but what it it well . virgin uses sprint network , see if you find out their network your area before you buy virgin phone .

almost 2 years ago , my fiance i signed up 2-year contract verizon . we got great deal both phones . two years later , both phones excellent condition very few scratches dents . this great phone someone who would still like option take pictures short videos but not use it heavily . i 38 pictures saved my phone right now sending picture messages extremely easy relatively quick this phone . pros : - sturdy : it not thin or flimsy some newer ultra-thin phones . i dropped my phone so many times my phone still excellent condition . thing i really like when you drop phone , battery doesn't detach easily . everytime i dropped my old sony ericsson , battery would also detach i'd restart my phone . - compact : though it thicker side , this samsung very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it . - good buttons : those who text message lot , way buttons feel really make difference . buttons this phone smooth great texting . - menu short cuts : side phone , you adjust your ringtone volume simply pressing up or down arrow . if you hold # , your phone goes into vibrate mode . if press camera button right hand side phone camera video menu pop up . you also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press " up , " i mine set calendar . - long battery life : i'm not one spend hours my cell phone , but every day use , this phone great respect its battery life . there times when i forget charge my phone go 2 days without charging it still close fully charged . - camera flash other neat options : you also adjust brightness level , self timer , take multiple shots , 10 different " fun frames , " 5 different colortones like sepia , monochrome ( black white negative . - zoom : you zoom upto x4 . - phonebook : contacts easy access it easy search entries . i like fact you enter multiple numbers under one name . you enter persons home , mobile , fax , office pager number . you also enter alias email address . you assign personalized ring tone picture you categorize your contacts different groups . - voice commands : pressing holding * button , voice command menu appears . it nice feature but not something i often use . - speed dailing : one feature i take advantage speed dailing . it nice only press button instantly connect person . - menu styles : there 2 different menu styles you use . i like nature option which cute animation each subcategory you scroll through . my fiance uses icon style which more simple design . - custom welcome goodbye screen . cons : - video quality poor very pixelated . my phone only holds 2 15-second videos . - despite generous 15 ring tones , it hard finding ringtone doesn't make you want pull your hair out . out 15 ring tones , there only 2 decent ring tones . - antenna : i don't use antenna very often but when i , it hard time staying up very flimsy . - picture quality not best . if you intend taking lot pictures i would recommend investing better picture phone . - not v-cast . - no mp3 player . overall : this cell phone exactly , cell phone make calls . it some additional features like picture taking video organization tools like phonebook planner but it still fairly basic phone .	1
this phone great !!! i love this phone . i no problems this phone all . camera pretty good , it small cute size , it good reception . i would definitely reccomend this phone !!	1
if you cell phone , you need charger . you don't get car charger , but it good idea , if you car . this works well	1
it snapped right , looks great . but sometimes it slip press buttons side your phone . it either make phone not work , or run down battery	1
case fits like glove ! appears high quality rich leather look feel detailed stitching . cover back easy attach not scratch my phone , which i checked removing case . my only complaint i not like small mount back attach carry clip since i never carry my phone my belt . attachment kept my phone laying flat . no problem , if you slide off back cover , take off small foam piece inside , you see tiny screw . just unscrew remove mount . there hole your cover ; if you not like just reapply foam piece . attach back cover phone then fill hole piece felt . looks fantastic . if you clip user , clip clear plastic cheap looking i found it difficult remove phone it . but maybe good thing so it won't fall off accidentally . i cannot comment how well case wear since i only few days . my friends seen it love new look . i chose navy blue case am truly amazed how well case fits phone . awesome !!	1
i like shape plug so it doesn't cover up any other outlets . it works , what else i say	1
$50 bucks you pay here , you get phone plus 300 minutes airtime . that not bad deal considering if you bought phone itself elsewhere , it would $20 bucks , buying airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so . plus tax . so cost works same . frankly , i see no savings buying this phone this site versus elsewhere . regarding sim card , i noticed nothing unusual or problematic insertion . sim card delicate silicon apparatus highly susceptible esd -electro static discharge- just like computer ram . esd probably primary reason why so many reviewers phones here failed . i'd bet every single one them reside geographical locations where weather cold snows . before you handle sim card , you should " ground " yourself touching something metal . otherwise you run risk destroying sim card esd . phone itself ok . it basic . emphasis basic . i just transferred my mobile # motorola v120c notwithstanding annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones c139 , only edge c139 over v120c color display . please also note c139 not any kind interface pc so means you stuck bundled ringtones wallpaper . imo , motorola could added port accomodate usb interface this model . it short-sighted just dumb not considering v120c -also same price range- such port . voicemail extremely problematic set up this time . i only just phone activated this past saturday ( 10/28/06 ) it took over 5 hours my number transferred over new phone . also , it entirely new network . southern california , network this model tracfone uses cingular . suffice it say , i followed all instructions website explicitly , however cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message it doesn't recognize my number input my voicemail number . around around it goes . i anticipate nothing but problems " technical support " when i contact them . they very polite customer service reps , however they barely speak or understand english . i am envisioning hours bs call i make because past experience indicated me these reps not technical whatsoever . note tracfone : customer service reps mexico who barely communicate your american consumers most assuredly not tech support . also , i wasn't overly impressed keypad where it concerns text messaging . v120c actually more intuitive . it much easier use . but c139 one advantage this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus v120c , tracfone deducting 0.5 units each incoming outgoing text message . i'm not sure why considering deduction units zip model phone . it should one uniform deduction across board . consumers should contact tracfone customer service inquire this phenomenon . bottom line i would recommend this phone anyone who upgrading monochromatic led phone wants * inexpensive * phone much easier eyes color display . inexpensive you bought it retailer $20 bucks . but if you want pretty new ringtones wallpaper , little more flexibility , then get yourself nokia 2126 . same money you spend here , nokia better phone . it usb port , speakerphone , plus other extras . you probably won't any trouble setting up voicemail either .	1
my tracfone good reception . i like it free call waiting free caller id . if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then ' refer friend program ' give each us 100 free minutes . please send me email i send you fast referral . it win/win ! thanks	1
after two no-brand aftermarket cables which invisible phone nokia phone suite , this cable included software driver worked perfectly . ( note : nokia phone suite must separately downloaded , but free charge . ) we uploaded photographs our nokia 6102i our computer added phone numbers computer keyboard phone . nokia gone pains ensure you buy expensive cable . i recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone . some motorola phones accept universal mini-usb cable which i believe cheaper	1
careful - amazon identifies this phone gsm 850mhz . it not . read ' vital statistics ' section full write up you see no mention 850mhz . check sony web page ( other people who sell this phone ) you see it not work 850mhz . i don't own this phone but researching it friend when i discovered this discrepancy . i gave it 4 stars because cool magic mirror case - i no idea if this phone really good or not	1
i bought this phone part sprint/nextel sero plan . i used it 14 days before deciding it didn't fit my needs several reasons outlined below : - battery life sporadic -- i got maybe day worth power it . one time it completely discharged overnight . price phone ( two year contract it carries ) this dealbreaker . - nextel network coverage gone downhill my area ( i former nextel subscriber 3 years - so i some experience coverage around town ) . i getting disconnects sporadic no signals . - phone would sporadically mute ringer . incoming call would light up display but there would no ringing . this seems happen after i put phone vibrate then turned it back ring . - same monthly service fee , i getting less access web services no high speed internet ability . admittedly high speed access not useful tiny screen -- but if i'm going locked into 2 year contract i would like some fast internet access phone . i880 still uses slow nextel data network . i not direct connect/walkie talkie user . if i , then my opinion this phone might little higher ( since nextel presently arguably best fully functioning walkie talkie network ) . i could not justify locked into 2 year contract equipment seemed sub-par network not ( likely never ) support latest high speed technologies . below my initial impressions during time i used phone : thankfully motorola designed phone so micro-sd card accessible outside -- no need pull battery update card . here big things i don't like . 1 . you cannot use any mp3 songs you transfer micro-sd card ringtones . 2 . you also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it picture you took phone or paid download . any message ( mms ) you send yourself only set caller id image not wallpaper . 3 . battery life my phone flaky - i'm getting maybe day one-half usage approximates 60 minutes talk time perhaps 6 10 picture messages . you must pay nextel download ringtones . there some users who modified phone reportedly able use ringtones off their micro-sd memory card - however process more technical than what your average user might want tangle . note : sprint nextel both owned same company . if you're making decision sprint vs . nextel , there only couple reasons i think recommend nextel over sprint . first , if nextel coverage better . second , if you need use nextel walkie talkie feature . sprint side company features phones significantly enhanced web browsing higher speed data communications . nextel side clings larger phones aims their services industrial/construction market . almost every consumer , sprint side better deal . sprint my experience better customer service whereas nextel tends transfer you endlessly among variety customer service representatives . here my summary this phone after using it two weeks : good : -beautiful speaker phone-compact design / solid feel-2 megapixel camera , ability capture movies-flip swings open when you push button-nextel sms/mms messages now auto-downloaded - i believe this first nextel phone sport this feature-nice loud audio-both nextel walkie talkie directalk supportthe bad:-can't play ringtones off micro sd or via any other non-nextel transfer ( note : technically some people using motorola product called webjal make transfers cable - but this may more technical than average user would like tackle)-nextel my opinion their way out carrier , soon completely assimilated into sprint side things . while not entirely unexpected , it means nextel plans features not attractive non-construction users ( nextel core group ) . if you want mobile mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most sprint plans which include them . nextel doesn't super fast data speeds or network web browsing competing carriers . most web browsing nextel limited character based wap sites both crawl speedwise present unexciting character based screens . -the phone little bigger what some grown accustomed . -while not phone related , some users larger cities reported iden system nearing capactity lot busy signals . -i am only getting day battery life - which extremely low .	1
i very happy see amazon shipped me palmone brand stylus not some generic . this great deal i'm going order some more . thank	1
great battery , now phone goes way longer without needing recharged	1
excellent sound quality . noise cancellation really works . button headset string lets you automatically place call end call . very nice . works much better more reliably than any bluetooth set i've tried - i've tried almost all them .	1
this case good quality construction fits properly . it solves problem able plug proprietary cord ear phones while still case . two things kept me rating it 5 stars . i prefer magnetic closure velcro which this case uses . i also prefer option phone horizontal my belt which i find less cumbersome while working . fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning . this still best optional case if you want use mp3 player feature require use earphones	1
it not rocket science ... it works or it doesn't . device works fine . my only " complaint " cord bit short but lesser concern considering price . short cord only reason it didn't get 5 star rating . it well worth money	1

hi , i just recently purchased this phone . so far these problems . yes you restart device , it get hung , but i don't blame phone , after all it windows mobile 5 it . restart occurred twice me past week , so careful . this phone pretty close perfect . other than fact it windows , 3g connection crazy fast it amazing . if you take this phone ready take good data connect plan even thought it wifi capabilities , cingular programed it first connect their data connect feature .. which return give u nice thick bill .. once you buy phone i suggest you get this software spb pocket plus . it helps shutting down softwares running background , adds more features . screen clarity amazing it great features . it connect up 6 bluetooth devices once . overall i give it 4 because hardware . one star missing cause it windows . sorry microsoft but you need remove bugs outta this windows too .	1

i got this phone 2 weeks back although i seen this my cousin singapore quite sometime back . just right off box , phone quite impressive . many complain response time - yes , this phone slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine overall , very good phone what it offers . pros : * this phone tops ergonomics , ease use , presentation , features , bluetooth , speakerphone call quality . * wi-fi worth mentioning separately . it simply superb . * nokia connection manager far superior than anyone else market . it handles very efficiently one easily choose several access points save lots money . i accidentally downloaded big chunk data going pay through my nose next month ! * all apps come this phone quite good . * bt sync my apple just fine isync . also i transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable my wintel . phone automatically toggles " mass storage " mode when it connected pc , which pretty neat . * i haven't faced any such problem i charge my gadgets daily . i also tried leaving it uncharged it comes 2-3 days , good enough my call volumes . * symbian browser fast stunning . bookmarks feature neat . wi-fi feature helps you set all bookmarks while you're home then use it wisely while you away . * camera quality good . dual camera just great idea . camera settings similar professional cameras - very very impressive ! * tried video mode came fine . * battery life , many claim , seems short - but i charge my gadgets daily - so not big issue * headset comes phone really good . * tonnes themes , apps etc available this phone ..... cons * my first biggest problem main navigation key badly designed . it made cheap plastic almost 8 out 10 times i " selected " option when i actually trying navigate left . it so frustrating . * my second biggest problem this phone when slider , screen light not come up . so you won't know - even day - which button press answer question " unlock phone ? " - you get practice but it truly pain . * process taking picture sucks . picture what you see screen when you hear shutter sound not what you get . there serious lag shutter click final image . i sincerely hope if there would some s/w patch this . i am anyway not big fan phone cameras - exception sony ericsson w810i . one far superior camera quality i saw so far . * slider lock unlock feature good bad . i am putting this bad section even if slider opens your pocket , phone could turn end up accidental redialing . so you would need small app locking properly . overall - good phone . this point , nokia better phones like n95 etc - course very expensive .	1
i've this phone year half no problems . it good making calls which really all i ask phone . it easy enough use i even bought one my elderly parents they've no problems . my carrier cingular i've excellent service ny tri-state area because it quad-band phone , i've also able use it while roaming internationally . battery life just okay ( not good my old nokia ) ... i recharge every other day normal use . overall , it lasted me long enough i would call it good value .	1

these javoscreen treo 650 protectors really very different anything you've normally seen . typically , 95% screen protectors very thin material you stick screen , hope against hope you don't bubbles , but you almost always . when screen off , you see bubbles , thankfully when screen , bubbles pretty invisible ..... but these javoscreen protectors completely different animal . they thick , tough , relatively firm . because those properties , they go no bubbles , they easily moveable ( adjustable ) should you not get it perfectly first time . further , they come little squeegee thingy make sure its there good . this state art screen protectors . this all becomes even bigger issue men , because whiskers , over time screen get dulled scratched . because thickness quality these , scratches screen no longer issue .	1

pros : - best pictures yet ( 3.2 mega pixels ) cell phone i used - built flash ( rare cell cameras ) - cover over lens camera - good music player - expandable memory sony m2 flash memory - fm radio - bluetooth works great - screen great size wonderful resolution - edge device makes internet data fairly quick usable pc modem ( via bluetooth)cons : - keys small difficult press - camera lens cover needs lock switch ( mine opens just walking around takes pictures lint my pocket ) - very annoying - sleep timer bit quick should adjustable - i shouldn't expect it thinner since it size very small digital camera but i'd still like it slimmer .	1
product delivered timely manner functions properly	1
i used carry my treo 600 original case came device . but soon , i found out original case kind loose my treo fell out it once . luckily , it carpet so no damage ( least no visual damage ) . after incident , i started looking better case , this one what i found . what i say , you don't know how bulky treo until you wear one your belt . case its job - it provide nice secure protection treo it allows you clip your belt sideway so you don't carry it around your hand or you pocket ( which barely fit ) . but treo quite heavy it thick , so you definitely aware your treo hanging your belt . sometime , i just feel like it too much burden i want get it off me . but overall , i still prefer this than original case . , heaviness not this case fault , should blame handspring ( now palmone ) not making it lighter ... : -	1

this great phone i've used year now . i'd like highlight standout features make this phone unique , especially its price . mp3 player . just get adapter usb port ( few bucks ebay ) you plug your stereo headphones . too bad they haven't offered update motorola digital audio player . microsd slot . you take microsd card , put it into included adapter plug into sd slot your computer copy mp3s ( you take any mp3 make it your ringtone , cropping it make it more effective ) , 3gp videos ( animation looks great , but sound slightly out sync , search web video converters convert your content ) , or pictures . i love making my own ringtones not buy them . bluetooth . i got explorer 320 headset $20 it works great it . battery . easily exchangeable . easily slide off cover pop fresh one . battery life isn't very long , so it good spare battery , they're cheap . video camera . not high quality video , but its something old razr couldn't . customization . i love customization . you set up hotkey side phone , two top keypad , directional pad go directly most functions phone . it even shortcut list list all your favorite features . you easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper . also you find replacement faceplates make your phone unique . speakerphone . works even when closed . good using automated phone menu systems when you're put hold . speaker loud great ringtones mp3s . plastic may resonate certain sounds though . vibrating alert . vibe then ring ! why doesn't every phone this ?? it should default standard all phones . vibration definitely strong enough feel pocket . if you one show off your ringtone , let it move onto ring , otherwise descreet answer immediately . ----------------------------------------------------------- what i don't like . i don't care much motorola menu style . i prefer sanyo samsung interfaces . menu same razr or slvr . all lettering outside well some case paint rubbed off . i carry my phone my pocket so phone aged bit . i scraped off remainder lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off . ----------------------------------------------------------- all great features what keeps me getting samsung t509 or other more expensive phones . this phone just all fee-free features you could want	1

i used i530 little over two years no problems unit , or nextel service . simplify your reading , here list pros cons . cons : little chunky ; lacks up date features tech ( such color screen , external display , etc . ) ; battery life nothing write home . pros : durability ( dropped off roof , still going strong ); looks ( yellow model ); call quality excellent ; good speakerphone ; digital 2-way great feature . overall , i am very satisfied my i530 . only issue among cons any real concern battery life , but this characteristic most nextel phones - perhaps due nature iden network which they operate . even after two years , my original battery lasts more than day moderate use . pain ? slightly , but given advantages nextel , its worth remembering charge up more often . please beware several overly negative reviews nextel posted below - my experience their coverage , customer service , etc . very positive . just make sure you your homework respect coverage before you sign up any wireless company . go one gives best coverage areas which you live , work , or travel . it always best actually put printed coverage maps test real phone . some providers overly optimistic . nextel maps pretty legit , least far i discovered	1
what i say ? it works very well - i keep this my car so when i travel i don't worry my palm tx batteries	1
i i850 , but i560 what my wife using 3 months . phone so good , my 2 year old can't destroy it ! ( he tried ) there only 3 things i don't like it : it doesn't very big screen , external screen isn't color , it no camera . other than it pretty much same higher priced models like i850 ... holding them together i suspect they fact same electronics inside , minus 3 things i mentioned above . if you don't take pic this really phone you ! you even submerge this thing water , it still work without needing anything special ! it gps built , all java apps . it everything higher priced models minus camera smaller screen . even though screen smaller , it color , very legible	1

samsung a900 great phone - motorola razr steroids . ( , it much more durable than razr . ) but battery life awful !!! you literally charge this phone least two times per day get any real talk time . not any more ! bargaincell price so low , i skeptical . perish thought ! i got battery time ; it very well packaged . it fit phone perfectly , cover it came . i plugged it let it charge completely . i then used phone three days without recharge ! whoo hoo !!!! bravo bargaincell ! way - even though this somewhat " thick " battery , it surprisingly unobtrusive : it not add " bulk " you might think , looking its picture . fact , i think phone actually looks better larger battery . i leather bytech carry case designed razr/a900 . it tight fit now , but i'm sure case stretch much like new shoe after it worn few days . not hesitate buy one these batteries !!	1
i gone through several smartphones past 4 months ( including , cingular htc 8125 , nokia e62 ) safely say this best phone i owned . palm operating system much easier use than windows operating system ( albeit , less powerful ) much more customizable synchronization-friendly than symbian os . its great easy installation software . pros : - very customizable interface , making phone very user friendly . you set any application or any number dial preset button . - palm os easy use , thus , you actually get take advantage many features phone , unlike windows mobile , which definantly more powerful than palm os , but cumbersome difficult use times . - you use this one handed phone ... very important people like me who like drive text/email . - perfect size , weight feel phone your hand your ear . lack antennae stub this model huge aesthetic improvement . - easy synchronization your outlook mailbox or palm desktop - set phone automatically retrieve your emails alert you , which very useful ( although limits battery life ) cons : - battery life somewhat worse than other phones . i charge my phone every night , i probably use 15 minutes internet , 30 minutes mp3 player , autoretrieve email every 30 min , 2 hour talk time well some other palm functions . if you it set auto-retrieve your email , battery life seems decrease impressively . newer manufactured 680s fix installed this problem apparently . - you cant plug your own headsets into device ( like your ipod headphones ) you use specific headphone fits you get it palm . i hate . i suggest buying this phone unlocked palm , instead cingular . i got it 350$ 1g sd card stereo headphones included . also , if you get it cingular , they always ruin look phone plastering their logo all over both sides phone . overall : extremely satisfied this easy use , highly customizable , powerful smartphone , despite somewhat shorter battery life .	1
i needed bluetooth headset because all driving i traffic but i didn't want look like dork some giant blinking contraption sticking out my ear . i took chance this headset even though i read review saying it didn't sync up well vx8300 . i couldn't more happy . even though it small(about 1-1/2 " ) buttons still large enough use ease . it also fits snug comfortabe my ear works well my vx8300 .	1

this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1

this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
great price vs buying it your cell phone company	1
this case made l6 . l2 uses same case , so they both fit within this rubber case . however , keys laid out differently l6 - so this case grooves slightly off keys . i didn't give it low rating , because it well built actually really great product - just wanted give other l2 owners warning . it works well , but it just little funky l2 , but totally usable . price , you just can't beat it - it much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out your pocket	1
works great , its bit bigger than some headsets , but this case i feel thats good thing , microphone lot better job filtering out background noise you don't get feedback loop where person you're talking hears themself since mic futher away speaker . only complaint would i wish volume went up just bit more , it hard hear people sometimes while driving freeway if they talk too quietly . one note anyone buying one ... hole plug charger into under thing holds it onto your ear , it rotates out way . it took me awhile find it when i first got it	1
my first blackberry i love it ! i wanted stop lugging around phone rather heavy dell axim just contacts , calendar task-to-do list . i wanted phone synched outlook great phone . pearl definitely best choice . i didn't really care internet , music or camera , but cheapest $30 internet plan cingular lets me unlmited internet access home email instantly - it just great ! i bought $40 1gb card now 150 mp3 songs pictures it . i use mp3 songs ringtones it great able instantly recognize who calling music . camera ok - not great , but ok very nice on-the-spot photos you don't want lug around regular digital . i actually emailed picture spot - very cool . battery life phenomenal so far . however , i'm not heavy user i used profiles phone automatically shut off 2am 6am every day . only cons so far : 1 ) getting used keypad - believe what every one says intuitiveness keypad figuring out correct word . i've followed other folks ' advice don't really look words letter letter - i type sentence then look - it works like charm 9 times out 10 keyboard correctly identifies each word . still , this type entry so different first time blackberry user , but getting used this still better than using stylus touch screen like axim . 2 ) also trouble restart if i change ringtone someone - i reseat battery get change take effect . hmmm ... 3 ) volume when talking , even speakerphone , average - not terrible , but ok . so far , my reception fine . 4 ) i also wonder how long track ball last - i'm not heavy user i still use it constantly . i think i'm going buy insurance plan just case . these minor cons far outweighed simply great phone synchs outlook so very much more . bye bye dell axim . it true what some say - i'm " crackberry " because playing this thing addictive . i'll update this review again 3 months or so , but i don't anticipate any problems . my only regret i didn't hold out until red pearl came stock my local cingular kiosk . i would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you	1
i just recently bought blackberry pearl i love device . its stylish , beautiful , small , it some awsome features . however , since i bought it amazon , cingular took forever just approve me give me new number . so i constantly call amazon ask them my order . then i receive phone almost week later than day i placed my order i follow instructions my phone didn't want work . so representatives told me there something wrong my sim card ... when it wasn't . luckily i called cingular very helpful representative helped me set up my account actually service when amazon told me there something wrong my sim card lol . overall , amazon should more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy . but whatever i love shopping @ amazon i truly love my phone i bet you love it too . :) !!	1
i palm 650 two years . it few issues , but generaly speaking it worked well . unfortunately one my big concerns phone size . when i first bought it , i not think it woud big deal . but after it while , it felt like i carring brick my packet ( if you smart phone user , then you know what i am talking . ) i wanted switch phones but all smart phones market same disadvantage good but huge size . i debating bjack when i discovered pearl . first i thought it would not same capabilities palm , , or bjack ; but i it 3 months now tell truth , there so many advantages this phone i not miss my palm all . pearl not only not flaws palm , but also same ( or more ) capabilities browsing speed . trackball works way better than touchscreen . so far i am very happy my purchase i am glad i got pearl not or bjack . best part i finally feel i am carring phone not brick my packet . not sure it ? then not believe me ; simply check reviews all smarth phones online . you surprised find pearl gets usually higher grades than most other smart phones	1

i bought this little phone 8 months ago am truly pleased it . i don't use it every day , or even every week . i got it keep me when i'm driving those inevitable times when something goes wrong you need phone right now . it paid me more peace mind than it could ever cost dollars . what i like phone itself it very small light easily tucked inside pockets or small bags . it charges fully very short time , under two hours first time out box under hour after . it holds charge very long time i just found out recently . driving appointment i running late needed call let them know . i'd forgotten recharge phone over 2 months expected it dead doornail . my delight it turned right i made call no problems . can't beat . virgin prepay plan perfect users like me ends up costing $6 month . tell me there something better i'll say prove it . i looked long hard find best possibility this it . i think it still . nice , dependable " insurance " type phone , i couldn't more pleased genuinely recommend it .	1

this phone great corporate phone . it best windows mobile phone currently available , my oppinion . they overlooked few features : -there no lcd light tell you its charging status - instead screen all time . -there no way know when num lock key - so you just press number key see what comes up . -in order unlock phone , you press on/off button top phone , which not very convenient location . -the track wheel feels pretty cheep	1
i used seidio rubberized case before this . it thinner pearl barely noticed pocket . this case 1/2 inch wider thicker , but it protects phone all sides except top . phone slips out effortlessly . it looks great , magnet puts it sleep , which nice . even though it bit more bulky i can't go back seidio because protection looks . i just use screen protector , but many use best skins ever it no problem . it also pretty cheap ($15 ) . less than seidio other pouches out there .	1

i've treo 650 long time . i wasn't 100% sure i'd want 680 , when it first announced , but big nasty scratch my 650 screen helped me decide take plunge . i'm so glad i . lack protruding antenna makes it fit my pocket much better , internal slot sim card eliminates my worry it might get lost , covered sd card slot very welcome , because darned thing always popped out my 650 . only thing lost 650 reset button . reset 680 , you take out battery . that not big deal , since even 650 , you remove battery cover get reset switch . what better 650 ? main thing me cell phone radio slightly more sensitive it take 8gb sd cards ( sdhc ) . i use this phone everything , since it also great palm organizer . addition , i've installed registered version pocket tunes , so it very good mp3 player . it even compatible playsforsure , if you're into . that why i'm so happy see 8gb support . i also use phone play games , like monopoly scrabble , when i'm waiting line or boring meeting . i absolutely zero complaints this phone .	1
pros : pda , good mobile phone really gets out , camera all those ' kodak moments ' , all packed one good pricethe cons : you'll need get replacement longer life battery ( seidio makes one ) , browser ( blazer ) many problems . i'm very happy purchase this smartphone . i've wanted treo few years but could never justify spending big bucks one . you work around problems unit new battery browser software , it nice little phone . i haven't bought memory card it , so i can't report mp3 capabilities , but i am going direction . somehow i don't think it replace my ipod , but you never know	1
overall , i am very happy this product ; it protects phone without taking away its beauty nor it make phone bulkier . my only compliants it not come screen cover it makes phone slightly harder slide open .	1

t-mobile worst customer services . sometimes , it company mistake they still blame it customer . since i started my plan , i problem reciving my bill time . so , company start charging me $5 late fee four consecutive months . also , when i tried adding additional features such their text-message-bundle , change account not take effect till two days later , i charged 10 cents each message i used these two days , it costed me additional $4 . every time i tried complaining their customer services , they just wouldn't listen . i am starting get feeling they just trying maximize their profit . more than once , if i stay long-enough line , they put me mute so they don't listen my complaining . i feeling i am treated like dirt not like customer . i worst customer-services experience t-mobile . also , reception not best country . i friends who using same phone one i but different network , they getting services places where i don't it , they pay same amount money	-1

this phone case worse one ever treo 650 . yea color great but , if you just tap it ground or anything color comes off wit ease . screen protector not great either . piece plastic over screen .... you lift it up so now you piece 2 cent plastic over five hundred dollar phone . not smart . now there someone who likes this cheap piece plastic over screen protect it . quote " it attaches easily i especially like screen cover - most cases don't this ( if you drop phone crack screen , you're hosed ) . " well this statement . insurance !!! if you invest five hundred dollar phone then you must insurance it . so , i guess you not hosed end . final : i am very disappointed cover recommend you invest product ( leather ) . i bought this item hoping something different . sale price really what it worth . six bucks .... $6.00 $500.00 phone .... my bad .. i really should tough this one this warning others . how cheesy ... i tough i getting deal	-1

i wouldn't buy this unless it emergency , because it one those chargers reports errors , makes your phone start beeping non-stop when it charging . i don't want this because i like charging night , other chargers don't this ( i guess what it it starts fluctuating power wall , like switching off , when battery fully charged .. so it beeps if it plugged over over ) . when i first got it , i trying carefully plug it into my phone -- i didn't want damage little metal things inside my phone or charger . it wasn't going smoothly it didn't match up or seem fit inside all . so i went day without phone i more research see why heck they'd lie it fit my phone . finally i got fed up because i couldn't find charger anywhere where i live i tried forcing it . finally it fit ! but i shove it .. who knows if it damaging my phone . but it charging so i happy ( my cell my only phone .. so i cut off world ) . then i tried getting it out couldn't figure it out ! i jimmy it off , broke off one side hooks helps it secure itself . i able put it back , finally learned routine so speak , taking it off , but it cheap . it very cheap . so , charger works , but it very hard use it isn't convenient all . i don't recommend it unless it emergency . me , it	-1

after owning 3 blackberry over years , i made switch blackjack because camera ability add memory . compared blackberry , microsoft operating system very cumbersome ( me ) somewhat frustrating set up initially . plus side , blackjack good battery life , screen excellent it best reception i've ever experienced . reason i only gave phone 2 stars because after just 3 months moderate use ink ( ie : numbers ) began wearing off keys . it point now where phone pretty much unusable , especially when it backlit . i called cingular first , who passed me samsung where , after 2 hours phone , i told my only option send phone ( my primary source communication ) their service center wait 3 weeks . my surprise , they went say , their discretion , they might also charge me repair . i've read comments these reviews people complained service i always just assumed they exaggerating but now i've encountered this , i feel it worth considering . if you're thinking blackjack , i encourage you aware , one , ink may inexplicably wear off keys , , you may well your own when it comes service . i feel it reasonable expect device expensive this remain functional least 3 months if not , company who sold it should assume responsibility making it right .	-1
i think this pretty good earpiece ... granted , i've only used one other ( it flimsy little thing came w/ my friend nokia ) , but this one far surpasses one sound quality comfort . where my friend would fall out my ear , this one ( once i got it figured out ) never comes loose . second , listening people my friend , i would turn up sound hear person well , then they sounded muffled distorted ; but my jabra i actually turn down volume my phone they sound crisp clear -- moreso than when i'm not using earpiece . finally , when my friend calls me uses her earpiece , she sounds distant muffled ; i've no complaints people i'm talking using jabra , , fact , my mom said it sounds better when i use earboom than when i don't . ear gels bit hard get used . they oddly shaped ( you see picture ) , there six them total -- three them each ear . lots reviewers complained fit comfort ear gels , while others claim these most comfortable earpieces they've used they fit perfectly ... i honesly say i've both experiences . when i first got this unit earpiece kept falling out everytime i would turn my head : * very * frustrating . i tried pushing it into my ear hard i could , i tried holding it place my hand , but only seemed defeat purpose hands-free earpiece . nothing seemed work . i thinking returning it . i thinking throwing it into traffic i-95 . then one day , somehow , i came realization you sort twist it into your ear -- little poky-out part stuck fold your ear next ear canal ( not fold top your ear ; if you it'll just pop out again) -- then * voila * it stays put . matter o ' fact , it'll stay put so well it'll little bit difficult -- even * painful* -- get out again . i imagine people different ear sizes , different patience levels , lower iqs might different experiences than my own . but all i say once i this little bugger figured out , i golden . i love this thing almost never talk phone without it . admittedly , it bit difficult get into your ear -- i'd say it takes upward 2 seconds get properly ( before you're good practiced it ) , which may not sound like lot , but it long enough not recognize somebody voice or hear first sentence they say , or whatever . * very mild * frustration . but like all things good pleasant , it takes little practice get it just right now i it so i answer phone , slip earboom my ear start conversation without missing beat . fact , i find this earpiece so comfortable i forget it until i go scratch my ear or something ! other complaint i saw here it not compatible nokia phones . fact , it even says right package it not compatible nokia . that funny , i nokia 3589i it works just fine . they make two other models earboom ( one which clearly would not worked my phone ) , both which claim nokia compatible , * neither * those works my phone ! confusing ? yes ! problem it doesn't work * all * nokia phones . while browsing store i noticed ones claimed nokia compatible list phones it works , but it didn't include mine ( it included one , numerically speaking , very close my model : 3590 ); which piqued my curiosity . so i went friendly manager store i he opened two different packages me let me test both them . one them worked , other didn't . strange part it we couldn't see visible difference two units ... then one us noticed one them jack two small black stripes around it ( that this one , if you look closely picture you see them ) , while other one ( one marked nokia compatible ) three . hmmm ... curious . so my advice either know your phone well ( , little book handy ) or ask help before purchasing . all all 4 5 stars . i'd give it 5 stars performance comfort , but take it down notch extended period getting used it confusing packaging . addendum : several months later little piece foam fallen end boom so any sound wind becomes almost unbearably loud person other end ... living windy providence , this bit annoyance . also , while i problem where earpiece would cut out seconds time so i couldn't hear person other end line ( , likewise , they couldn't hear me ) unless i jiggled little jack . this * very * frustrating . ** now , some reason , i'm not problem anymore . i'm not really sure if problem due my phone or earboom . either way , it something buyers should aware	1

i recently purchased this motorola hs805 headset find it more than adequate . price , it worth every penny . ability using aaa batteries puts it above all other headsets respect . nonreplacable rechargable batteries gimmick . once they finally die , your headset useless . too expensive send away repair . so you throw your headset charger away buy new one . good company but not you . depending your ear structure fit either formfitting or loose . reading other reviews here one infer this . me it formfitting . also you may infer bluetooth telephone or device it pairs would make difference performance . some reviewers here felt this headset low volume or allowed some static . me others , we experienced no such problem . best bet check return policy if you find it doesn't meet your standards . but if it works your device , you headset goes 16 days standby 22 hours talk time 1 aaa alkaline battery !. you never bothered charger unless you use rechargable aaa batteries which pretty good idea . if it also fits your ear comfortably then you winner	1

if you own , you know battery life standard battery horrible . this charger also slot 2nd battery , which great . so i charge my phone standard battery , extended one verizon sells back slot . never worry battery life again . also , it makes wonderful stand phone , when hooked usb cable , you get data conectivity too . only downside , it won't charge extended battery until phone fully charged .	1

samsung great phone black jack . unfortunately , headset jack not standard jack , but instead one unique samsung phones . therefore , you forced buy samsung headset . bottom line -- don't bother . design horrible . earbuds don't stay ear . what makes matters worse each ear bud rigid teardrop inch half connects cord . any pressure or movement teardrop say clothing or hair pushes ear bud out your ear . i hope samsung creates adapter fit jack allow you use regular headphones .	-1

i it since october it clearly best phone i ever owned . it also replaced my camera , i am now never without camera . i attend lot concerts where cameras almost always prohibited . they don't give phone second glance , not realizing it got 3.2 megapixel capability . i got tons fantastic shots last 4 shows . after throwing 1gb memory stick ( i think it $79 ? ) it now storing half gig my best music display says it hold 300+ pics right now . movie function rocks too , however you going want up very close subject . sound playback movies fantastic though , so least concert videos make good listening . phone works flawlessly my pc . if i throw it usb cable , it pops up instantly drive , just like camera . just drag on/off music pics . all pics very nicely numbered named . if i don't care viewing files just want move stuff off phone , i don't even take it out my pocket . bluetooth connection allows me use their software move things around . also very cool it pops up my computer modem , which i actually able use immediately my pc anywhere program . terms phone , yeah it great . contact list easy work , call clarity no issue all , good signal , no dropped calls , etc . etc . ( this all cingular ) . speaker phone works well . it needs charging every 3rd day , charges very quickly . charges slower but usb plugged it also charges . only thing i think complain when using usb cable charge , it only wants charge it 89% . if i want 100% i throw it real charger few minutes .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
