i like some other walden farms products -- i gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one not very good . i tried dipping different kinds fruit into it , tried it combination chocolate dip , finally gave up threw rest it away . cellulose gel walden farms uses give its sauces body seems slight spicy/sour " bite " it ; it doesn't bother me chocolate dip or most their dressings , but here it ruins flavor	-1

i know many people who would love elk carcass their holiday . birthdays , christmas , hanukkah , martin luther king jr.

personally , i didn't like tazo red bush tea very much . i've three different kinds roiboos teas so far this my least favorite . it seems like flavor roiboos itself pretty mild , case tazo tea , flavors they add completely overwhelm it . i found i remove tea bag very quickly lest cup become overwhelmingly lemony acidic . perhaps other pallettes appreciate strength those flavors . personally , i couldn't wait finish off box so i could find better flavor . other roiboos teas i tried milder mix flavors , much better overall effect . my personal choice right now trader joe orange spice roiboos , which apparently bought some , but not all their stores . orange flavor much less up front than lemon citrus flavors tazo tea , overall effect other spices very nice . tea smells lot like other spiced foods ( pumpkin pie comes mind ) very nice gloomy afternoon . also unlike tazo version , flavor this tea gets nicer richer longer you let tea bag steep , although even just pouring water over bag leaving it few seconds usually enough nice cup . admittedly , there lot other roiboos teas i not tried , but this one hit me because its good flavor local availability . keep mind this not opinion tea expert , i never roiboos tea africa so i don't know what it supposed taste like its authentic presentation . just my personal taste	1

don't get me wrong -- i'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff give you cancer due lack testing . i'm just really miffed fact splenda plenty carbohydrates it -- 24 grams per cup !! they get away this setting their serving size 1 tsp , which 0.5 . would you believe 0.5 product there less than one gram carbohydrate !? no way !! sweetener sucralose not carbohydrate , but since it 600x sweet sugar , they need bulk it up make it measure like sugar . but all maltodextrin they use filler carbohydrates . this could really screw up somebody atkins ' induction phase . example , day before i learned this , i made some kool-aid splenda . i didn't know 2 quarts i drinking down 24 carbs ! what ? find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose . they use water filler , it super-concentrated still , it truly 0 carbs . i look forward day when mcneil nutritionals meets demand zero-carb splenda .

first time i encountered haribo gummi bears when i went germany semester overseas . i won bag these classroom prize . first , i thought these going ordinary gummy bears , but , boy i wrong . these candies truly step above all other gummy bears . germany , this brand gummy bears . competitors ' bags sold much lower prices , but few people buy them - that because difference quality taste noticeable . other people reviews regarding sweetness softness accurate . haribo found perfect combination . during rest my stay germany , i became huge consumer haribo candies . haribo sells other gummy candies , but their " gold bears " best . when i returned beautiful america , i disappointed find haribo not so easy acquire . they sold online other stores decent prices but after shipping , cost quite steep . i am truly excited see these bears offered amazon free super-saver shipping . if you never haribo gummi bears , you really need try some . 5-pound bag seems like large quantity , but i promise , you not disappointed	1

i lived japan many years really enjoyed using these " noodles " soups , stir-fry , korean-style cooking , etc . if you looking pasta , these may not exactly match your craving , but nonetheless really versatile ! my advice those who don't like smell upon opening package drain them , sprinkle liberally salt rub through clean hands , then rinse cold water . this how they prepare them japan - it removes any odor they ready use	1

it ain't spaghetti , folks , but used properly it enhance your eating . it great wet , soupy type dish . eaten " " ( after rinsing ) noodles very soft tender , too soft pass dry italian type pasta , unless you always cook dry pasta death . boiling them minute or two firms them up somewhat , but they never become firm properly cooked dried pasta . reviewer who said pasta out due his/her type 2 diabetes ... it not ! i'm same boat , we still enjoy pasta , we just need measure it control carb servings always use whole grain types slow down sugar load . i weigh out 2 oz . before cooking 2 carb exchanges ( 1/2 cup serving measurement absurd because different types pasta fill cup differently ) , i use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables big salad side . oil vinegar salad dressing helps further temper blood sugar rush . course , if you eat lots carbs breakfast lunch , don't plan 2 carb servings pasta dinner . i given up ( white ) italian bread side ! that worst part , but pasta least do-able .	1

**** tazo chai black tea enjoyable chai experience most part . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " rich blend teas spices style hill dwellers himalayas . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile chai " cinnamon , creamy , sweet spice " " medium-bodied yet full-flavored , spicy kick cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , black pepper . tazo describes aroma " sweet , spice " . those pretty accurate . black tea " blend " little bitter , though , even minimal brewing . it real trick get it brew long enough get experience flavor spices without tea turn bitter . ingredients chai : black teas , ginger , cinnamon , black pepper , cardamom , cloves , star anise . it caffeinated . tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo chai gets only four stars . ***	1

i cannot speak food item because it my pantry i not tried it yet . i speak however , customer service importfood.com thai supermarket . first off - this first time i ever asked submit review something i purchased via amazon - this tells me importfood.com interested feedback their customers order continue their process improvement . i applaud happily complied . secondly - out all times i ordered amazon - this fastest delivery i ever . i so surprised see box - i didn't know what it first because i wasn't expecting product several weeks - not couple days . when i opened box , i couldn't believe it product i just ordered . so i am very happy customer found exact item i looking , very reasonable price even better rate shipping ( i worried inc . gas would drive up shipping make it not worth it ) then receive it so quickly . thanks	1

this like hot sauce concentrate . you must dilute it use it . not try eat this stuff straight or you miserable hours , then some . lets just say it burns both ways . teaspoon entire crock chili make chili hot enough near inedible , i like very hot spicy foods . five or six drops probably more than enough entire dish . tabasco isn't even comparable this , because no amount tabasco would make dish hot . this truly hotest sauce i ever , i think it killed my tastebuds ( slight sarcasm ) . wash your hands thoroughly after use there often residue lid . if you rub your eyes they burn long time , i would suggest flushing them water 10 minutes if you unfortunate experience . first listed ingredient habaneros	1
so much better than buying those pre packaged microwave popcorns . always way i like it	1

***** tazo china green tips green tea slightly stronger green tea than tazo zen , i liked it doesn't contain tazo omnipresent " natural flavors " almost all their other teas contain , which me not advantage . i like natural , real taste real ingredients sans vague " natural flavors " sans flavorings , sans essences , etc . china green tips delivers this cleaner , purer way than tazo other teas . i liked this green tea ! ingredients china green tips simply spring-harvested green teas china . it contains caffeine . tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague unnecessary super premium tea . china green tips none these " natural flavors " it shows quality cleanliness tea experience . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " traditional chinese green tea delicate fresh taste light green liquor . " this perfect way describe this tea ! their web site , tazo describes flavor profile china green tips " grassy , vegetative , sweet , ricey " . tazo describes aroma " vegetative , popcorn " . i would rate this tea , tazo general , very good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi or aspen . still , this tea excellent , so i'm breaking my tradition tazo teas giving it five stars . if you enjoy super premium teas , stuck tazo some reason , choose china green tips you quite satisfied . i can't honestly say any other tazo tea . ****	1
hands down , best steaks i ever . i scoff people who would refer them dry : they simply don't know how cook steak . we buying omaha steaks products 4 years . no , i am not butcher , but i enjoy good steak . terms value : $6-$8 steak would scare me if i saw it menu restaurant -- these steaks value . there no supermarkets my area compete these cuts beef . these days there not lot products or companies out there who deliver consistent quality , but omaha steaks one company who continues impress me .	1

how you not love twinkie ? it compact , delicious , aerodynamic . if you actually look ingredients , twinkies made flour , water , shortening , eggs , sugar ... sound familiar ? it cake . there some preservatives added increase shelf life , but they make up very small percentage overall treat . air we breathe probably contains more dangerous ' additives ' than twinkie . let us face facts ; if one eat slice after slice chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients , person going end up coronary bypass land just quickly if one gorged twinkies . twinkies , like anything , moderation just fine	1

i bought seven beans seven dollars , bit unimpressed aromatic quality . they didn't strong complex aroma right out bag bourbon beans known . not say inside bean isn't aromatic . after all , it guts really count . even though these beans don't seem aromatic other beans , this still killer deal !!! i recently purchased one bean popular brand " spice islands " seven dollars . unbelievably aromatic bean , but seven times cost these beans !?!?!? i think i'll just buy these use twice many higher quality beans . i'm still making away like bandit	1
i bought these greatest thing besides awesome price fabulous beans vp or ceo or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me thanked me my purchase when i responded , followed up again nice response ! how nice this day age ! i used these beans my home made eggnog this year it out this world . i first scraped bean then threw pod left it there till nog gone . ( not long)i also use one when i make my hot chocolate " syrup " ( lots bittersweet chips , melted milk little haff half bean scraped pod - once again left - i mske hot chocolate out it adding more milk taste little bitty bit brandy ... decadent ... oh my yes ! )this great buy , great beans , great company ! buy assurance !	1

i love this tea . filterbag smelled unbelievable , beverage itself brewed up into this gorgeous dark pink color . i wish i'd used my clear glass mug . i added little sugar because i can't drink anything without little sweetener , but your average person probably would fine it . this stuff terrific , i definitely recommend it	1
blend little apple cider mix into your tazo passion tea see what happens . this creates magical apple cider experience hints cranberry hibiscus flowers gathered ancient land . snuggle up spiced cider good choice because you then spoon exact amount you desire , but packets cider work equally well . this type tea you would expect enjoy after skiing some distant forest where you also munching homemade brownies or eggnog cookies . apple cider also works very well gypsy teas , especially lemon jasmine . deep purple/red color hibiscus fragrance tazo tea enough make anyone passionate tea . yet , this really tea ? it looks like tea , but it really herbal infusion made steeping hibiscus flowers , orange peel , licorice , cinnamon , rose hips , lemongrass red poppy swirling hot water . original flavor also slightly reminiscent hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which why it extra delicious cider mix . tazo teas mysterious experience into which you lose yourself sense abandon . so far i've tried more flavors than i count always impressed . ~ rebecca review	1
i received very well packaged ( promptly shipped even ) package habanero jerky mahogany smoked meats . jerky itself it obviously made good meat ( vs some garbage you'd get oberto or whomever ) . initial smell excellent . aroma pepper brown sugar . however , jerky itself somewhat sticky . pieces jerky itself stuck together , so extracting single piece consumption becomes chore . after you're , your hands all sticky . my guess if they manufacturer spent little longer dessicator , we'd drier product tasted just well . how spicy . well , my lips burning . i like . i really love habanero ( fact grow several varieties home ) . this isn't some quot ; slightly spicyquot ; product name habanero it make it seem macho . it scorch your mouth . my opinion , scorch good way . price great . you'd spend much any store , buying far lower quality jerky , just try finding habanero anything safeway . kudos amazon removing yet one more thing my shopping list . additional kudos mahogany smoked meats such wonderful product . i've taken one star off jerky so sticky ( i guess it sugar ? ) , difficulty separating out pieces jerky themselves . definitely recommended	1

unless you wealthy chocoholic , you would probably never blow 50$ these . gift however , this great box ( there similar all heart shaped box valentines - which cool if you dig hearts ) . it fits all qualities i look gift . its extravagant , its something person i give it love , its something they wouldn't get themselves . i tried 2 these , mixed berry ridiculously good . peanut butter jelly interesting . everything superb quality wise . i knock it down bit price , but honestly , its tough find fault this product . it much much better than regular godiva ( which i find super sweet overpriced )	1
i am huge fan tasty bite products , delighted find amazon now stocks them , since they expensive my small town ( no trader joe here ! ) . i excited see this variety i never tried before , readily ordered six pack these noodles peanut sauce , expecting same ready-to-eat food other tasty bites i tried offer . but unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes which rice packet merely need heating but already fully cooked , noodles here their raw state need boiled ten minutes , so you can't grab this bring it work way you most other tasty bite meals . also , peanut sauce delectable complex flavor , but spiced textured so i felt it really needed some vegetables or meat round it out . i love spicy dishes , but this meal seemed planned overly spiced so when you add veggies meat , it would perfect . so , quick meal starter home or way helping use up leftover meat veggies , this gets five stars . it delicious . some additions i enjoyed chicken , steak , bell pepper , cauliflower , carrots , eggplant , sweet potato . but i am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation eating other tasty bite entrees this grab go meal i could pop microwave prepared couple minutes .	1

red bull used my favorite drink , i would not go 24 hours without drinking entire . era ended simply because i beginning get sick paying over $2.00 one . i know several distributors who offer product $1.50 , but i seldomly stock up stuff end up paying $2.00 plus 8% tax , which comes out $2.15 . which fine me until you realize you spending over 700 dollars year this rate . it never stopped me before i always felt it worth it , considering drink helps me focus college each morning . however , i recently noticed days when i not school i drank red bull , rather than full energy ready jog , i would become tired . i began wonder why i would get tired after drinking red bull . maybe my inner body saying , " stop drinking this **** every freaking day your life ! " whatever case , i decided stop buying it daily basis just drink it when i wake up very early . hopefully this make it become effective my body again , because i think i may overdone it , considering i probably consumed well over 1000 cans my life . i personally enjoy drinking cold red bull . set aside energy factor . while many people ( actually everyone i know ) says it sick makes them gag , i kinda like cough droppy taste offered red bull . i find red bull conversation starter myself - kinda like smoker talk . i love sip my red bull discuss weather or some other exciting news my peers . while i tried so many other energy drinks , i say i hate all them . there never energy drink i enjoyed other than red bull . i guess i just like austrian people so much ( fact red bull vegan ! ) other hand , it full man-made chemicals might some weird things me future - only time tell	1

**** tazo decaffeinated chai black tea enjoyable chai experience most part . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " rich blend full-flavored naturally decaffeinated teas exotic aromatic spices . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile decaffeinated chai " creamy , vanilla , sweet pungent spices " . tazo describes aroma " sweet spice " . those pretty accurate . black tea " blend " little bitter , though , even minimal brewing . it real trick get it brew long enough get experience flavor spices without tea turn bitter . ingredients decaffeinated chai : naturally decaffeinated black teas , rooibos , cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , chicory , cloves , black pepper , natural flavors , star anise . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo decaffeinated chai gets only four stars . ***	1

pico-balla very subtle candy -- you find yourself eating large amount it if you don't pay too much attention . different colors each differently flavored , you eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly . i like bite off outer layer first then eat inside , but my wife eats inside part first . just very different candy what we used -- it doesn't taste overly " sugary " , won't feel like you greasing your mouth fructose , etc ... give it try . i wish i bought two boxes . i wish amazon offered balla-balla , too . i can't wait try sometime , but i would rather wait until i get it good price . amazon price 66% world market price , even less what online candy stores sell it . take chance it .	1

this sauce medium heat everyday use . it excellent roasted pepper flavor , there * no vinegar * get way . consequently , you get exactly what one should expect pepper sauce ... versatility flavor not try smother character food you season it . every-day sauce should not leave patina your tongue . this not boutique novelty , it household staple . 32 oz . size right size hot sauce household . you want good ? try tapatio cottage cheese . you'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again , i promise . i use it just anything except cereal ice cream , but my personal favorite applications tapatio : eggspotatoespizzaanything creole ( forget tabasco ! )cottage cheesemost ricemac cheeseand course ... mexin my opinion , this best sauce your local grocery store	1
my husband , non-celiac , eat this pancake mix ( make waffles ) all time . recipe calls egg whites beaten until stiff , so it bit more work than many other mixes . but , it worth it ! result tastes like * real * waffles . kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles , but texture isn't nice	1
sure , it not 100% pure vanilla extract . that indicated quite clearly ingredients . molina vanilla made mixture pure vanilla extract synthetic vanillin . personally i love its strong distinctive flavor , regardless what percentage pure vanilla extract it . those who feel it too strong , use half amount listed recipe . i know couple people who this when using molina vanilla . again , i like flavor , so i use full amount called recipe . this stuff great flavor really kicks things up notch	1

stella d'ora fudge cookies best dessert i could find my lunchbox growing up . its crisp cookie fudgie middle perfect milk or hot tea . many times i would eat cookie part save fudge center last test my patience because there nothing like eating chocolate . stella d'ora brand common nyc grocery stores ( throughout nj ) , so everytime i would visit relatives there i would buy breakfast cookies , annisettes , fudge cookies . i seen breadsticks nc but nothing else so its so nice find amazon them . stela d'ora always seemed so refined since they italian adults who liked little treat their coffee or cappucinos . my father used dunk his cookies coffee they would become warm gooey , while i preferred them crisp milk . either way , try package this some other biscuits . they really unbelievably good .	1

i using chemex 10-cup coffee maker almost year never such good coffee before my life . i am constantly looking forward my next pot coffee ! there downside this coffee maker : it more manual procedure than what you used , it also takes couple pots learn how use this most efficiently . first time i tried use mine , i ground my coffee way too finely it just took forever ! big time consumers : you boil your water separately ( you water kettle right ? ) then you gradually pour boiled water through chemex . this means while coffee brewing , you pouring , or watching , or giving filter area bit stir . now up side : you never ever ever drink better cup coffee . i use filtered water , freshly ground home roasted beans , this chemex produce finest coffee i ever pleasure drinking . this coffee pleasure ! fact , i've totally given up using cream sugar because my coffee no longer anything hide . up side : clean up means swishing chemex warm water tossing water down drain . you also wash bottle brush but this rarely necessary . brief swish really all it takes get your chemex looking factory new . try your electric drip machine ! ha ! thing never look brand new ! oh , here final upside : this chemex brews best coffee you'll ever drink , it costs less than just anything . you probably already spending more money than this every month starbucks ! go ahead buy yourself one these . if necessary , wake up 10 minutes earlier make your coffee . better yet , wake up 20 minutes earlier . when your coffee ready , instead dumping it into travel cup bolting out door , sit down enjoy your first cup next 10 minutes . you deserve it	1

if you only starting your trek into world serious coffee appreciation , then i highly suggest you , without haste , purchase one pound least whole bean jbm . also good grinder , temperature controlled machine decent water filtration system . pre-ground takes much flavor away , compaired properly fresh home ground coffee , coffee lessened without prepaired correct temperature filtered water . but why something so expensive ? why jump deep end pool before even getting your feet wet ? some may scoff , saying only true coffee fanatic would understand or able appreciate this blend . entirely true . but how anyone really understand without first tasted standard which all others must judged ? thus why this review only four out five stars . you see , jbm so subtle , so complex , new tounge not notice what makes jbm quite so wonderful . it " perfectly " blended coffee . flavor , bitterness , acidity aftertaste . scale one ten , they all rank dead even five . every other coffee like exaggeration this hard get bean . this should first coffee ever cross lips anyone who wants learn these things . how else you truely understand other blends	1

okay , maybe heading exagerates just tad ... red popcorn much more tender husk than regular popcorn when it pops , it explodes kernel so well husks basically disappear . when it pops , it looks pretty much like any other popcorn , except popped kernels slightly smaller than usual . meet white , but you see little bits red kernel them . you would never know pretty , white popcorn you eating started out red-colored if you hadn't seen it before popping . flavor great ! it smelled " toastier " it popping than other popcorns we've tried . we tried it all different ways , toppings ranging sweet savory every way good . we also liked fact it grown amish people happy support their efforts raise their crops " old way .

tazo teas relative newcomer tea market , founded 1994 steve smith . but , what tazo lacks history it makes up pure inventiveness ! among tazo many blends passion , bold flavorful mixture hibiscus flowers , other tropical flavors , citric acid , orange peel , licorice root , cinnamon bark , rose hips , lemongrass , red poppy . brew it up , you rewarded bright red infusion , tart exciting taste . now , this tea definitely not everyone . you tell ingredients , this tea strong decidedly tart side . when drunk hot , you probably want sweeten it honey or moderate it milk , or possibly both . but , when made into iced tea , passion really comes into its own - decidedly refreshing thirst-quenching . just what you need hot summer day ! so , overall i would say this pretty darn good hot tea , great iced tea . buy some today	1

when i first tasted this herbal infusion it seemed i tasted this flavor before when i lived africa . it much more delicate than rooibos tea golden rose color . when blended clover honey , it almost hint lemon . honeybush plant only grows high mountains western eastern cape regions south africa . i might first tasted this tea when we visited cape town went table mountain . plant harvested during flowering season . honeybush naturally sweet , caffeine free very little tannin . i still enjoy adding honey this tea enhance natural honey flavor . this mineral rich infusion rather soothing help calm nervous system . this technically wild mountain tea hint aromatic flowers . i only wish i drinking this tea while visiting table mountain . it gets rather chilly up there when you overlooking atlantic ocean . ~ rebecca revie	1
i originally bought this small container fleur de sel fish recipe i found said it " de rigeur " , however i thought it like any other salt simply grainier . course , i only added little bit salt after i grilled my fish not think it would add much dish . you imagine my surprise when i tasted fish , only veritable bouquet flavour explode my mouth . i must say i'm never going use commercial salt my food anymore . now i understand why great chefs past present consider this queen all salts ..	1

this good matcha price . best matcha much more expensive but well worth it , espcially if you happen study japanese tea ceremony or you tea connoseur . if you get this type tea , it wise buy proper bamboo wisk sift it first , otherwise it get lumpy . making matcha traditional way well worth effort there lot learn it . some say master tea ceremony take years . far health benefits go , there lot talk green tea good you i must say , i feel really good now i am drinking it 1-3 days per week i even lost few pounds . matcha caffine if i more than two or three bowls i definately feel it . it probably wise idea not drink too much matcha before bed ! green black tea both caffine most part . different teas different amounts caffine . it good idea read labels carefully your research if you sensitive caffine or must avoid it . type caffine beverage also lot how people respond it . caffine also different effect everyone depending your body . some people get jittery , others don't more caffine you consume less you tend feel effects it . i tend feel jittery coffee or soda but not tea . matcha also great smoothies , baking , ice cream much , much more . note ; fresh matcha very bright green color , old matcha gets darker pine-gray color it taste bitter or ashy clumpy consistancy . always note date . avoid stale green tea , i reccommend storing it airtight bag keeping it fridge . stale tea isn't noticable when you put it smoothie or cake but if you make hot beverage you notice big difference quality . matcha generally served sweets good paired fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends clash chocolate . course mochi ( sweet rice cakes ) go very well matcha traditional choice but unless you live near asian market , or you're good cook , they hard come short shelf life . frozen mochi ice cream nuggets good option too sold lot grocery stores . i reccommend this tea if you new drinking matcha . if you love it , it tastiest matcha it price range if you hate it , least you didn't waste too much cash . if you taking tea lessons it good ' practice ' tea won't break your pocketbook , especially when you find out price tea bowls , fukusa , natsume , furo other utensils used tea ceremony ! regardless if you study chado or if you casual tea drinker , i encourage all tea lovers try matcha . methods making preparing matcha over 800 years old when you taste it , you certainly understand why it never gone out style !	1

it really shame tastykake brand only established itself northeastern portion u.s.a. , rest world missing out finest pre-packaged snack pastry face this earth . those who unfortunate enough not know what tastykake , it like little debbie or hostess , which centered out philadelphia area . should you happen run into anybody philadelphia area ask them this line products , they inevitably tell you once you've experienced snack god tastykake butterscotch krimpet , those drake coffee cakes hostess twinkies no longer any appeal . it hard put into words just how fantastic these spongey , moist , vanilla butterscotch frosted guys . seriously , butterscotch krimpet even beat out many fresh baked bakery products , despite mass manufactured factory sealed boxes . i seriously suggest grabbing big jug chocolate milk ordering box these amazon right now , especially if you're not mid-atlantic region under false assumption hostess quality product . if so , you blown away krimpet culinary goodness . tastykake seemingly pompous slogan goes , " nobody bakes cake tasty tastykake . " once you experience butterscotch krimpet , you'll realize they more than substantial reason gloat .	1
