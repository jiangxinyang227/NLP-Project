first off , i cannot believe how mad this game made me . i like all kinds games , but honestly trying figure out some levels this game left me stumped . it one thing stuck somewhere retry lot , but several times during this game i stuck area no idea where do/what , etc ... even after i killed all bad guys i didn't know how get out room . this game not intuitive ( sp ? ) all ! secondly , this game should not called incredibles , it should called mr. incredible , because you play him almost all time . playing elasta-girl great , i really enjoyed part , but when there lot baddies guns , mr. incredible pain since he no way block anything , so you spend lot time getting pushed back until bad guys reload . i liked first mission dash ( when you play dash , which only twice ) you run fast ; however second mission i just lost my patience because i restart million times because i couldn't see what ahead me . playing violet bad , they should lot more her instead boring stealth mission . incredi-ball mission incredibi-sucked , it took me like hour hit something because it difficult place . i'm just finishing up game now quite frankly i haven;' enjoyed lot it , which shame because i really loved movie . some levels too hard because you barely find way something mr. incredible needs more than punch people . currently i'm rocket silo level i keep falling down trying get onto platform . what load fun 100 times or more . bottom line : playing elasta-girl fun , everything else either blah , or made me want swear lot . hopefully second game better . i'll renting instead buying , this game left me disappointed overall	-1
this game originally released 10 dollars . almost everything it pulled straight diablo not quite good . though this game few things it interesting , enjoyable some people , i would just skip this game go diablo 2	-1
if you're looking spend money this , don't . spent my teen years holed up my bedroom commodore 64 ( current fan i am ) , i really excited when i heard this product . unfortunately , it stinks . there couple games this contraption real gems , rest mediocre best . overall bad choice games isn't my issue this thing though . it crummy joystick . control horrible . stick clunky unresponsive makes playing real chore . someone else pointed out their review , often it doesn't even respond when pushed certain direction . i can't believe it 2006 yet these companies releasing plug-n-play video game contraptions can't even make decent joystick ! real letdown	-1
this second part xenosaga compares very badly stellar first part , regardless what anyone says . i no longer wanted play this game after only 30 minutes . game begins lots boring instructions very non-intuitive battle system . annoying amount experience points needed defeat nearly every main enemy , including very first one . battle result saving screens painful chore . battle camera inadequate characters look act like small puppets . game very few items , weapons , or armor deal even ordinary enemies , which stronger than expected . skill combination successful main enemy not available until engaged enemy . battles main enemies long , which isn't such problem . however , they often conveniently power up end battle , just frustratingly finish off battle-weakened party . voice acting very uninspired sometimes even annoying . i don't remember any music this game , so plain it . some character changes likely upset least half everyone who liked first xenosaga . very noticeable use swearing , which main reason i don't enjoy or watch hollywood movies during my rest relaxation anymore . new , meaningless characters introduced into story , focus shifted far away main characters . cover character hardly says or anything this time . there one short scene main characters during critical moment , but if you blink you miss i t.t his game far more frustrating than challenging , which not good game trait . i don't recommend even playing this game before reading above , fully prepare disappointment awaits . if you're looking forward anything made first xenosaga great , you extremely disappointed . second xenosaga better completely avoided .	-1
when disney interactive released quot ; who wants millionaire , quot ; early 2000 , they anticipated very warm response disc , which firm but low opening price . however , when actually played , game sure depress . if it isn't crudely simple , design poor uninspired . entire game essentially based one lackluster thing : regis philbin repeating same phrases over over again . quot ; sure come back ... who wants millionaire . quot ; quot ; i hope you'll join me again ... who wants millionaire . quot ; if one doesn't decide resell ( or simply trash ) this game within its first week purchase , they work disney interactive or regis themselves . don't waste your time this pitiful effort	-1

i swear if it wasn't i liked final fantasy 7 8 so much i'd just break this game then i'd move happy . but i can't because would waste money only thing kept me game fact i did'nt want waste money . this game makes kingdom hearts look like rated game . oh my god this so childish . you know how most final fantasy games they try make main character cool they didn't feel like doing this one . you monkey-man ! how stupid . plus other character way more dumb looking main one im just happy i beat put awful exp . behind me . ahhhhhhhhhh	-1

one couldn't stand nba ballers , i thought i would give this game try . pros : create ballernice graphicscons : defense ? if you fan pheonix sun basketball , you love this game announcer needs learn englishthe whole " i-ball trick stick " horrible you sreaming you're stuck second side game required before you advance 1 tourthat stupid mic trick allows you score 4 points one shotstupid watch this trick you can't stop despite fact you still move your player . you can't even block ! you not choose who you want face other game modes unless you playing two player . guess which game i'll trading nba live 2007 or wwe smackdown vs raw 2007 this fall ?	-1
i gave it one star because there no way give it less . this game when played box great . so when it came out pc i bought it . big mistake ! control too hard learn . when you battle you can't stop think which keys when used together work . there too many keys you need push together even simplest thing . i wasted my money this game . i deleted it never play it . don't waste your money	-1
halo 1 steroids , halo 2 clear microsoft stamp bungie creativity control it muddies up what balanced gameplay . hackneyed single player story makes no sense , no flow , levels aren't replayable . you thought library halo1 tedious ? try headache inducing map design this game . also nonsense , unneccesary switch elite perspective half game , new group covenant bad guys look like rejects captain planet cartoon . apes mohawks , yeah , nice design . i only play one or two levels single player , they so noobish , it loses appeal quickly . multiplayer . okay , 2004 upon release , this great game . it took time go up level , ranking system wasn't abused it now . once new maps , kept harddrive ( read mod kids ) released bungie , opened door full blown chaos . now 2 years later , modding died down somewhat , but whole new slew bridging connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find game no lag . so i still play occasion , it lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you play your map choice , choose servers good connections , then modders big gun noobs find type game they want play too . i only pray halo 3 multiplayer improves this system , otherwise i'm xbox console permanently	-1

i know pelican screen protectors styluses tempting because they're always cheapest ones available . should tell you something . first all , top screen uses adhesive . it smooth plastic middle , but edges leave sticky goo screen . because edge different material than middle , it insanely difficult squeeze air bubbles out it , adhesive , trying again again isn't much option . furthermore , sticky edge white , not clear , it looks horrible my onyx ds lite . after so much difficulty top screen protector , i checked online reviews . i read several reports people who used pelican styluses pelican bottom screen protector screen protector very drastically scratched up within hour worth use . so , whether stylus too harsh bottom screen protector or screen protector too flimsy stylus , combination just doesn't work . many people report simply throwing their pelican write protect sets into trash , so i'm not only one paid pelican money something that going into trash . no matter how inexpensive pelican product , it still too expensive if you end up throwing it trash too . i know i'm going avoid pelican screen protectors styluses future , i very much wish there reviews here amazon before i bought mine . i dig through nintendo ds forums read other peoples ' opinions . finally , if you already bought one hate it , you remove it using scotch tape edges peel it off rubbing alcohol remove residue	-1
this game good concept , nice graphics , some definitely funny moments , but gameplay total bore . there two main gameplay styles : " investigation " " trial " . investigation worst ; it involves nothing more than checking everything room , talking everyone , ton pointless reading , much like old point-and-click adventure pc . court sections little better , but not much . once again , it very linear ; you don't use your brain much , just try all options . once again , there huge amount reading . there way too much dialogue packed into game , not near enough actual gameplay . most talking aimless , too ; very little it actually advances plot . overall , this game just tried way too hard good plot characters , left player little more than click objects scroll through text	-1

i bought game couple weeks ago . i hesitating buying it initially , but finally i because all good hype game . i wish i didn't buy i t.t o fair , i admit game astonishing landscape , cities level details game . i don't think i ever seen suhc creativity perfectness earlier games . i am sure lot people find such features enaough them adore game . me , landscape not enough since largest downside story , if there any story , " my perspective " . i abandoned playing after closing 4th or 5th oblivion gate . i don't see any excitment playing game any further . i explored most cities though , quite quickly . conversation looks silly every time camre zoom person you chating . it nice first couple times but then .... i am waiting my sweet gothic3 go out . honestly i would prefer playing gothic1 playing oblivion . just tell you action/excitment i am talking , i would like say when i got gothic2 i played almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water play play lots play .	-1

i so excited see this game come out- i loved godfather , russia love , hype surrounding this game incredible . actual game , however , incredibly disappointing . driving controls , especially compared driving controls godfather , awful . i so much trouble driving i kept looking through handbook see if i doing something wrong , but what i saw i using controller way i supposed . most missions involve driving , under specific time limit , these awful controls , i gave up early- way too frustrating . musical play list you get control fun , but i would liked more free-roaming like godfather . i also looking forward hearing everyone voices opening credits- dale earnhardt jr ??? but since i almost totally given up it now , i guess i won't get hear their voice acting talent . anyone know if they plan re-release this xbox 360 ? maybe some control issues could worked out before then . this game so much potential right now it not living up	-1

starsky hutch fan since i kid , i looking forward playing this . graphics quot ; cartoonquot ; horrible need quot ; vrquot ; points becomes annoying after awhile . bad guys like something chinese kung fu movie , you shoot them accurately it takes all day kill them ... that playing ps2 gun ( i can't imagine shooting controller ) which makes you lose mission because you down quot ; vrquot ; points . dialog gets annoying too you can't skip hearing it either	-1
i rented this game my 3 year old . who loves movie . he tried play it . he like it . i tried play it got dancing part . i couldn't get past it . i tried 5 days . my rental time up . i returned it . i haven't rented it since . this game way too hard beat . my 3 year old got bored it real fast . i would not recommend this game anyone . don't waste your money buying it . unless you expert video games . i'm just thankful i rented it instead buying it	-1
such great visuals i love most star wars rpg/shooters , but , i cant believe this point click game . i hoping kotor2 would implimented normal battle engagement . theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during intense battle actually turn around , click target , then engage someone else after kill . days boulder gate point-n-click should over , but i guess theres crowd this type gameplay . still good game , but dissapointed	-1
first off i just want say i've read " secret old clock " it made this game even more boring because i knew basic outline . i see above review adult age 35 loved it , which i understand . but i'm 15 i found this game overly boring . puzzles way too easy , driving around horribly car part game made me want quit playing . it says youll get pay if you some chores people ... i didnt get anything . although i love herinteractive i love all other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 it . i would only reccomend getting it if it value pack nancy drew games	-1
paper , idea 24 video game sounds like great idea , upon first glance it , it seems like it firing all cylinders . featuring all major players series reprising their roles ( kiefer sutherland , dennis haysbert , elisa cuthbert , etc . ) storyline tone atmosphere captures feel show , 24 : game falls apart once you get further into it . missions repetitive , animation graphics jumpy glitched , controls unresponsive say least . targeting enemies chore times you use analog sticks , but targeting just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks camera seems want work against you . some this could forgiveable , but further you get through 24 more rushed game feels . it shame too , considering how innovative series it early life everything game going it . if more polish put into it , 24 : game could something special , but it , it only recommended rental fans series	-1
game seemed start off like any other nancy drew game . my daughter played them all . however , after while , it seemed thow it easter egg hunt three year olds . everything easy find not mysterious all . all other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out mystery . however , this game took her two days . all other nancy drew games kept her intrigued kept her coming back more . this game breezed she quite disappointed . fact , her words end game , " that it ?

review bovey spot-on ! these games gotten more boring they go . majority this game spent looking same shells over over make same necklaces over over .... how much enough ? there no real sense scariness or danger ... just boredom ! game so short ... suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed what these games become . i loved final scene , i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never finished it without consulting walkthrough . this game just lame . i don't recommend paying full price it	-1
i read pretty good reviews this game so i bought it . i hoping something little action interesting storyline . what i got probably most boring game i ever played . - introduction/prolouge lasts 7 minutes or so , including credits . you cannot break out move on- after you set down your psp grab drink , you come back find there one short battle you play . then you go back " story " . characters long , annoying conversations you get press " " end each their sentances . again , no way break out , no in-game menu you manage game . you go through each painfully slow dialog box until " chapter " over . this game really bad . maybe it gets little more interesting ; it possible there actually something you besides watch characters argue . it really slow it all storyline dialog . there not appear any freeplay . if you played this type game before you enjoy style play , then you might like it . i bored frustrated first minute	-1
this game mindnumbingly hard not because its very challenging but rather its set up fail . most missions thrust you into situation little indication what . patients vital signs drops , you frantically poke your ds trying think what . nurse , who assists you , gives you vague ideas how before you know it you've failed mission . it would take me average 10-15 failures before i finally won mission . last mission i played made me quit , resulted 30+ failures . that only 1 hour half into game . graphics crisp clear . storyline didn't make much impression me . but i probably too frustrated pay attention . this game lot potiental but killed it constantly making you fail . not buy this game unless you extreme amount patients , game collector who keep it sealed , or you're gultton punishment . whatever you , not buy this game hype . it not live up it .	-1
this game fun injoyable , but bonus levels questionable it almost better less people	-1
make no mistake , this memory card you if you've got gamecube ( which i'm assuming you , or you're planning getting one soon ) . anyway , there 251 blocks this baby , which may not seem like lot , but it . it gets job , you don't worry it corrupting data or anything . i've mine while nothing happened files saved there . it also easy save delete information this thing simple click button . please , don't get damn third party memory card madcatz , my experience corrupted data , constant reformating card ( which erases your files anyway ) . only go nintendo , they're only ones who know divine nature their memory card . i must say , though , this casual gamer . someone who doesn't every game they possibly get hold . some ea games , exammple , take up over one-hundred blocks memory . basically , what i'm saying simple : if you're one who ton games , you may find yourself buying more than one these memory cards before you know it . not every game save just game . resident evil , example , saves different block every time . just like playstation memory card . if you're like me , however , you probably don't many games it bother . other thing i must caution simple : this thing , like every other memory card , small hell . this one even more so . if you , keep it plugged your gamecube all times . great thing memory cards , just everyone them , simple : you take them anywhere . your same friend also own super mario sunshine ? hey , that great , now you leave your copy game home take your memory card . it lightens load . it essential memory card if you buy gamecube , this good one . if , however , you happen someone who ton games , this won't hold you over long enough , you'll buy . no gamecube owner should without memory card , though .	-1

civ name tarnished . analogously , one thing i learning just because sid meier name product , it doesn't mean product good . case civcity : rome , unfortunately , it doesn't just come " modestly good " - it comes " dismally poor . " i've tried hard not let this influence my beliefs civilization general , but after civ4 came out , i am starting believe firaxis games sid meier their way out . now this ... i regret inform great civ titles made long time ago . offerings today simple pattern : production rushed title came out major bugs ; games add unnecessary features designed justify overall cost ; consumers often abused ridiculous expansion packs containing features should obviously included original release - they take advantage our love franchise . this pattern so evident whole sid meier civ franchise degenerating . it almost seems , especially release civcity : rome , we once again expected simply drop cash new products based our love old . but developers not living up our expectations producing great games ! stay away civcity : rome . besides obvious blunders associated all bugs , you see even best patch cannot make graphics look good , narration sound effects better , or interface work properly . game dismal failure , i am sorry report . it seems like firefly studios idea got license firaxis , but they just cheesed it . watching what maxis ( sims simcity franchises ) firaxis ( civilization franchise ) doing their most loyal fans like watching your dad get drunk	-1

this game looked so crazy i couldn't resist it . i mean disney squaresoft trying merge final fantasy load disney cartoons must seemed like cool idea japan since they love cartoons so much , but usa it just insane . top you voice talents mandy moore lance bass , production values go you knew you one most ridiculous games history . hardcore fans bothered this looked like kids ' game but aren't games supposed aimed children teens anyway ? i ultimately disappointed kingdom hearts . world characters kingdom hearts not really final fantasy disney crossover it just place kids you control out their little melodrama . it like idea disney meets final fantasy just takes back seat . once you get past all hype kingdom hearts boring frustrating . nagging issue tiny areas this game . " planet alice wonderland " consists four small rooms course you spend great deal time them fighting off monsters . combat blend chaotic button mashing watching your party members act like total fools until they die . worst it respawning monsters , you can't take step without fight re-fight hoards shadow munchkins you just defeated . because this you'll spend majority your money healing items . bosses nightmare since they hard survive take forever kill ( 30 minutes normal . ) since combat so simple it really makes drawn out battles beyond boring . after beating 2 bosses i this game . i know kingdom hearts 2 , mushashi samurai legend , final fantasy 13 all same combat woes . i wish squaresoft would learn respawning enemies bosses 9 million hit points thing past	-1
please promise me you never play this . it not worth your time . if you paid money it , try find person you gave money kick them shin . hard . then throw your copy this game dumpster . seriously though , this game absolutely terrible . graphics bad even psx , combat quickly becomes boring all hell , story line confused fact there second dimension pointless . there no reason there 40 something characters , most them exactly same statwise , all them poorly designed . most annoying thing world , bar nothing , re-equip all your character spells whenever you switch characters . you like 50 spell slots . god . i don't think i even need say it , but those crumbums square couldn't pull hit out their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too . they should really stick straight video final fantasy 7 anime movies now , lest they risk making something like this again	-1
there nothing majorly wrong this game . plot well-developed , characters customizable , battles strategic . this probably primarily subjective , but i just didn't enjoy this game . it not because there too many movies--it because i didn't like movie . i also didn't like characters or villains or matter aesthetics . there some minor but annoying flaws game which further contributed my displeasure . which button press often counterintuitive , so i often found myself pressing wrong button . also , game badly needs journal and/or destination guide so you know where go -- i once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around space ship trying figure out where go	-1
amazon . ca --------- action replay max more than just video game enhancer ( vge ) .... or least it claims . my version quite old yet but it claims include region-free dvd player memory card compression utility ( squeeze more saves onto your memory card ) . i not used either these features personally , but i heard horror stories memory manager corrupting gamesaves whole memory cards ; some reusable , some permanently damaged . this fact you must load up action replay software access saves use memory manager turned me off using it . however , real reason i bought armax its codes i'll get those second . armax , like newer gamesharks , loads its software cd . this major annoyance me . every time you load game you must insert armax memory card ( which i don't know what ) cd , go sit couch wait software load , choose your codes , then get up put actual game dvd wait it load . you can't simply turn your ps2 go sit down . old days cartridge gaming you would snap vge game console so you could turn console go sit down . early generation gamesharks little box would attach expansion slot ps1 or n64 it . if you wanted it load before game , you turned its switch . even if armax perfect every other way ( it not , btw ) , it would get maximum 4 stars long you boot it cd first . i mean , why can't memory card part it least hold codes even just current game you're playing after system shut off or reset so you don't load software every @mn time . ok , rant over . codes . user interface armax better than gameshark . functionally , they very similar course , but armax just feels cleaner easier use . it offers beginner interface includes descriptions code functions ( not user-entered ones though , if i remember right ) , more robust expert mode . big advantage , theory , armax over gameshark its ability update itself using your ps2 broadband connection . upshot you download new codes your favorite games fairly quickly instead manually typing them all using controller . dark cloud go this silver lining you no control over which codes you download ; its all or nothing . since these updates stored your memory card ( not armax one ) , it quickly fill up codes gamesaves games 99% which you never play ! no wonder armax option come 16 or 32mb space its memory card . it store all useless codes ! any entered codes you choose apply either work , nothing , or lock up game . i come across all , though armax credit , mostly former . absurd choice forcing you download save updates every game ps2 library , when you may want just one , loses armax star . note manually entering codes : sub-headings folders game their own codes must entered if you want them show up game code list . finally , mentioned reviews bret morris glenn nichols ( amazon.ca ) , armax initially not work new revision fat ps2 couple years ago all . this happened me well . i returned three ps2s two armaxes before i realized it defect all current versions ( time ) armax . i send away get new disc direct intec which now works well expected . since armax shelves several years since i bought mine , i assume any bought today would not this problem . however , time there no way find out this problem without contacting intec personally . retailers not aware problem no notices posted codejunkies web site . this inadequate treatment widespread problem drops armax down two stars . my opinion , if you're market vge , both armax gameshark their pros cons . i would assume both released newer versions newer features than ones i . looks specs , assume nothing , don't afraid e-mail companies requesting details regarding any features you questions . i apologize length this review , but i find there very few in-depth reviews vges web or print . maybe reviewers feel they above using vges , i don't know .	-1

there way too many credible stories these things causing problems risk $400 360 . putting * any * kind power-drawing device piece sophisticated electronics its power supply just asking trouble -- i own lot expensive electronics i'd never it million years . instead taking such chance , go your local retailer buy little fan ( 4 " -6 " ) designed placing/clipping ( depending how you've got your xbox set up ) your desk work , etc . you get one $5-$10 don't worry leeching power your 360 . just set it up beside 360 so air flows beneath over top . since your average superstore dozen fans would fit bill , you shop one that quiet fits your setup . my 360 actually runs quite cool , although i small fan behind my audio rack blows my stereo amplifier.ps always , always , always put electronics generate heat open location possible . never put anything top , always place hard surface , always leave least few inches clearance all around . lastly , always use surge suppressor	-1

i agree other reviewers graphics vocals good , but i find gameplay itself less than stellar . starters , i've always irritated games don't let you save your status whenever you want . sometimes i just want get quick dose gameplay , but that not possible these games require you play through entire section before allowed save . contributes repetitive , tedious nature some sections . if you get stuck getting through certain bit game , you're doomed replay much what led up it over over again . i realize tricky camera angles some challenges supposed exist this game . more than earlier versions , however , i trouble getting myself lined up whatever task . tedious element . i found this game more test my endurance patience than actual fun	-1

my son ( 7 ) used gift certificate purchase this game his birthday . it came 4 dics we downloaded correctly but game would not play . we kept getting error message our graphics not sufficient . we don't much pc gaming , but we fairly new dell laptop computer we assumed sufficient . if item description more advising certain requirements would prevent game working -- we wouldn't wasted his time . we yet receive credit this item . huge hassle !! we'll stick ps2 games now .	-1
i really wanted see how developers could represent playing dragon , spyro only one came mind time . i decided get it , i put it my console , turned it , blown away ... stupidity . -basic storyis stupid . bad dragon plant mean gems kill good dragon . spyro good dragon , defeat evil dragon . everybody dances because goodness prevailes . -gameplayan atrocious story overlooked if gameplay good ( mario ? ) but spyro probably worst gameplay ever . it combines horrible , precise jumping puzzles abysmally stupid enemies . puzzles require you tap jump button certain time . if you don't , you go back beginning puzzle . it maddeningly hard some points , i am grown . so how hard would it kid ? enemies , they should get darwin award . many instances i breathing flame ( it limited reach ) enemy walked right into it ! enemies dumber then retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than paris hilton . also , they very weak dying 1-2 hits . there also very few types enemies ( like around 2-6 ) but they same ai equally pose no challenge , seeing they weak attack you one time . boss battles so simple they make you want shoot yourself how moronic they . also , playing other characters ( hunter , blinx etc . ) not fun . conclusion don't make mistake i made steer clear this game . get better ones yourself whomever you giving gift . ( oh , don't listen other people who gave this crudhole good reviews , they either . retarded or . never played decent game .	-1
this game really big disappointment me . i try this game because all hype all reviews here . played nintendo 64 game titled mario kart 64 i felt like it not much improvement . fact , i feel mario kart 64 better game . only improvement graphics . still , why characters not fingers ? this stage game you would think they would fingers now . anyway , after i played game i played bit cheated . i bored it within ten minutes . game supposed shine multiplayer but it fizzled . there so many gamecube racing games out there so much better than this game much lower price . one example better combat racing game burnout . if you get any one games this series you see what good combat racing game feels like . i feel mario kart double dash !! dumbed down version mario kart 64 . i so much wanted it great game . it no longer hopping ability previous game . me it just wasn't very good . double dash !! probably would better very young gamers they would probably more forgiving its shortcomings	-1
others said , this much-anticipated game . i played caesar ii iii extremely excited when i heard iv coming out . what letdown ! i didn't any installation errors others mentioned , i haven't game crash me . however , game unplayable my system - which only year old - unless i turn down 90% advanced graphics . " unplayable " , i mean ten seconds or more waiting time you click your mouse , when game responds . even graphics turned down , i still get lag when auto-save starts . mouse-control essential when building roads or aquaducts , this aggravating extreme . it appears sierra programmers designers put lot work into upgrading graphics . too bad i can't see them ! interface horrible takes up right half screen 1280x1024 resolution . this means you must rotate map build right edge . i much prefer " tabbed " building interface other city-building games . although you build roads diagonals this game - which you couldn't earlier versions - interface not smart enough auto-rotate buildings fit roads . you click drag rotate buildings , lag - even low graphics settings - make this exercise frustration . i dislike new warehouse management panel . sliders might look cool , but they're slow ( lag ! ) . i would've liked see additional options " only store basic goods " , " only store luxury goods " , etc . this would take some pain out managing them . trade ports different also - you can't see prices ! it appears some scenarios hidden milestones you meet order advance . one i'm playing right now , i'm stuck because my prosperity rating not rise above 36 ( 50 required win ) . i over 30,000 denarii my treasury , turning hefty profit ( meeting various demands rome ) least eight years game-time . i met exceeded all other requirements victory , but prosperity continues elude me . my city almost completely automated now - only thing i respond rome requests goods or cash . my advisors nothing helpful say . it not fun if i can't advance . so while game pretty - what i see it - it got too many frustrations worth much more my time	-1

i bought game couple weeks ago . i hesitating buying it initially , but finally i because all good hype game . i wish i didn't buy i t.t o fair , i admit game astonishing landscape , cities level details game . i don't think i ever seen suhc creativity perfectness earlier games . i am sure lot people find such features enaough them adore game . me , landscape not enough since largest downside story , if there any story , " my perspective " . i abandoned playing after closing 4th or 5th oblivion gate . i don't see any excitment playing game any further . i explored most cities though , quite quickly . conversation looks silly every time camre zoom person you chating . it nice first couple times but then .... i am waiting my sweet gothic3 go out . honestly i would prefer playing gothic1 playing oblivion . just tell you action/excitment i am talking , i would like say when i got gothic2 i played almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water play play lots play .	-1
i'll cut chase this one . if you fan final fantasy vii , you look over shortcomings this game find some enjoyment out it . it good story characters . its fun see some your favorite characters vii return . but if your not ff fan , then you won't much motivation play this game , i'm not sure why you would like it . its very average mediocre action game . its not horrible any means , but its just not very good either . honestly , this game could just so much better , just every aspect . gameplay wise , there nothing unique or interesting it , i just trying blow through it too get next story part . its also pretty easy not very challenging . i can't really complain environments your fighting through tho , they well some very well my book . while story easily strongest part game , its not without faults either . it pacing isn't very good , some it doesn't make whole lot sense either . but it kept alive strong cast characters , some amazing fmv typical square fashion . but story could much better well . i'm not complaining , because it good gives you good backstory vincent , but it could better if it longer . it just feels rushed , suffers because . i finished game 11 hours . if it longer closer 20 hours they really could some special things story , developed villians more . bottom line , if your ff fan , you'll probably enjoy it	-1
i really tried like this game , ea chickened out bought their way out competition . graphics sound great this game , but its ruined ea cheating ai . i never seen game cheat this much my life . no matter what play you call defense always knows what you calling , even if you think you them beat play , your receiver purposely drop wide open pass or better yet defender turns his nitrous oxide installed his uniform cover half field 2 seconds deflect pass . if you throw high pass , not worry lineman installed jet packs which allows them jump 10 feet air deflect or pick off your pass . if cpu wants you lose you lose no matter what you . if you qb going back pass lineman 3 feet away you , even if you press passing button , your qb just stand there so he take sack . this game total bs , there no way get off passes heavy pressure becuase game forces you into tackle animation . when you playing defense , you better off putting down your controller clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while cpu pulls bs miracle plays every single down . remember how i said your receivers purposely drop wide open passes ? not cpu receivers , cpu receivers , regardless their rating catch passes double triple coverage every time . if they don't catch it , ball just gets tipped over over again until he catch it . think you stopped 3rd down conversion ? think again , you get flagged pass interference or face mask penatly . remember your qb forced into tackle animation ? not cpu , cpu get 60 yard spirals while he hit ! what inconsistency you ask ? well let me explain . how it one game you totally , but next game , you can't even complete one pass ! i'll tell you why . cpu wants you lose , so you drop every pass , fumble every run get called every penalty book . i playing game , managed run back punt kr td , before my offense even touched field . then all sudden cpu turned its god mode every thing went right cpu . bs lobs , bs runs bs calls . i not complete one single pass entire first half . its not because cpu playing good defense , its because my receivers dropped every ball thrown them , wide open or not . i ended up only completing one pass entire game , 1 20 i think . this point , i knew i no chance winning , so i just started punting ball first down avoid any more frustration . my so called impact rb only got 2 yards 20 rushes , my so called impact cb gave up 3 td passes below average receiver . what point playing if you not even given chance win ? yes you win games i , but it so inconsistent . if cpu wants you lose you lose , nothing you it . i see why ea bought license , after putting out crap like this , they sure lose lot customers game knows how develop better ai , instead this cheating crap . i am taking this game store store credit i am ea good . ea sucks so this game	-1

i so excited see this game come out- i loved godfather , russia love , hype surrounding this game incredible . actual game , however , incredibly disappointing . driving controls , especially compared driving controls godfather , awful . i so much trouble driving i kept looking through handbook see if i doing something wrong , but what i saw i using controller way i supposed . most missions involve driving , under specific time limit , these awful controls , i gave up early- way too frustrating . musical play list you get control fun , but i would liked more free-roaming like godfather . i also looking forward hearing everyone voices opening credits- dale earnhardt jr ??? but since i almost totally given up it now , i guess i won't get hear their voice acting talent . anyone know if they plan re-release this xbox 360 ? maybe some control issues could worked out before then . this game so much potential right now it not living up	-1
playstation controller nice . however nintendo 64 user would remember n64 controller just snazzy , maybe even more so . xbox controller like brick when compared both . ps2 delivered vibrating dual shock controller standard unit . this controller feels great thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing all sorts movement . suddenly 2005 , four years after ps2 released , games like metal gear solid iii : snake eater god war improve this thumb pad function new mini-games feature . controller given new life because this . big negative problem sony ps2 controllers extremely poor quality . this controller , all its design , give you dual shock . first all you shocked how suddenly they break . drop it floor you easily damage l1 , l2 or r1 , r2 wing buttons . even if you don't drop it wing buttons usually break less than year if you enjoy gaming . next shock going through so many these controllers because this design flaw . adding up cost each controller i could easily bought myself ps2 then some more . cord also uncanny ability just wrap around itself kink . i never seen one managed remain straight . also when button breaks it tends release little pieces into controller so even if you don't need button game controller feels like it sand rolling around inside it . all its handheld conditioning controller far robust . i used very similar logitech cordless rumblepad 2 pc same design ps2 controller proper robust model . just comparing two side side makes ps2 controller look like it developed ussr early 80s or something . fact sony absolutely nothing improve quality their own generic ps2 controller probably reason why they made so much money out ps2 unit . it way too expensive even if controller more robust . i hope sony get it right ps3 next time . make these controllers more robust please . ps2 controller always far quality device since its inception only item let ps2 down badly	-1
downloading objects fan sites hit or miss -- i many collections i've downloaded work incorrectly or not work all next expansion pack , items i really liked suddenly unavailable . so , i looking forward " stuff " pack maxis . bah . yes , there several very nice items , but really , this underwhelming collection whole . items very limited collections small . pictures you see cover good portion what contained . like so many here remarked , money spent not equal value received . reviewer pointed out what title " glamour life " implies -- jewelry , house items , luxurious textures floors walls , clothing all ages , most all , excess abundance . there no abundance here . i've found items i like , but i am not impressed collection . maxis knows its target audience always hungry new items , i think it taking advantage fact , fooling us into thinking we getting much more than we actually recieve our money . i feel little cheated . if you must this , wait until price drops , or -- better yet -- find good , reputable fan site ( there some very good ones out there safe downloads ) download small fee or free	-1

i reading 8000-word review dave jeanclerc , i strongly disagree some his points . ( p.s. my review nothing xbox 360 version , which , apparently , awesome . ) i playing ea football games since mid-90 , i'm sick paying $50 same game every year . ea games owns rights college nfl teams , so you won't see any football games any other game companies , most noteably , sega , who revolutionized football simulation games late 80 . ncaa football 07 basically same ncaa football 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 05 06 . each year , ea adds little tweak mix , but overall , it same look , same feel , same moves , same everything . this year , they've changed way you kick ball , added more defensive audibles--that it . there few other minor adjustments , but none worth noting imo . fact , audibles they added exact same audibles you used sega espn football 2005 -- you call audibles individual defensive players . thieves . everything else exact same 05 06 . most disappointing thing , graphically speaking , crowd ... it still looks like flat rows objects moving unison , just like it games made 10 years ag o.o -- one other big change ... " improved " momentum meter . if you thought it ridiculous last year , wait til you play ncaa 07 . " momentum meter " such strong influence game , if you make one offensive mistake beginning game , you're doomed ... that it . you can't win . example -- i played fsu vs . um twice . first time , i made no 1st half errors , pounded hurricanes 31-10 . i played same exact settings same stadium again , purposely fumbled opening kickoff , giving hurricanes ball my 35 yd . line , i lost game 45-24 . fumble my only mistake game . nessler , herbstriet corso still making same exact in-game comments they saying 05 06 ... gimme break !!!! also , ai still atrocious . defensively , computer controlled team hapless . they blitz every down . fact , i've lined up numerous times 3rd long 4 or 5 receivers , defense continually loads 8 men box ... they don't even put enough db out there stop me . it basically game long bombs . if you choose team good receivers , you easily throw 400+ yards game continually going deep . safeties always blitz !!! safeties only drop back into coverage if you 3rd 20+ , or 4th 15+ . so how computer couteract your deep balls ? easy -- when momentum meter swings against your favor , your receivers drop every ball you throw them , ( even if you hit them chest ball ) when you finally decide run ball , your running back fumbles ball immediately . i played game usc cal , i kept switching play team didn't momentum , i ended up turning ball over every possession . you may reading this saying , " hey -- this guy played this game lot figure all this out . " no , not really--it exactly how i've played 05 06 game , same " glitches " i've encountered them , too . ea really dropped ball again . you paying $50 get updated rosters , , typical ea fashion , you don't even names any players -- just different skill levels . ea games suck . their soccer games horrible , their basketball games too slow awkward , they don't update their football games . i guarantee you madden 07 same madden 06 ... just watch . way -- ea gone all-out xbox 360 editions ncaa 07 ans madden 07 ... i'm sure those versions stunning . rest us paying same price last year game	-1
all i say this game not ' everyone'!! you able read play ! last time i checked not everyone read . i bought this my 13 year old son ... who autisum . he master just every game i get him but he can't read . so , him this game not much fun . i ended up playing more than he i didn't even enjoy it	-1
driving physics unrealistic they get . obtaining licenses extremely difficult , made worse poor car physics . your heavy car easily bounces off light cars , while light cars easily derail your heavy car . turning steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal , that sports tires ! long gone espn-like replays gt 2 . some reason cars look thinner than before . analog tachometer reduced just bar across screen . 3d mechanics headache prone , made worse poor physics cars . easily most inadequate music ever . game makes you start used model only certain makes , which nothing new . however , it takes long time earn any money better car . only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences track ?! game mostly only newer models , almost none few years ago , unlike gt 2 . only good thing this game you don't drive all time . b-spec driving mode win races you . just leave few minutes return victory screen . this help skipping painful , early parts game . powertrain still not modifiable . compression , bore , stroke , camshaft timing/overlap , valve size , other engine characteristics still not available . poor driving physics , engine modification would not helped this game . loading times very long , most annoying loading indicator ever . constant auto saving feature quick but become annoying . there excessive amount confirmation screens . this game yet disappointment , much like gt 3 . makers this game made it quite clear if you want know what real cars drive like , you drive them real . gran tourismo series over , unlikely return what they used . i'm not racing game fan , but only gt 2 good enough me buy . if you want good , car make-independent physics , you need play gran tourismo 2 .	-1

i guess first thing i'll say i got jedi academy before i got this game . i hugely dissaponted . i really liked jedi academy but this game not great . i cheat codes so i all wepons all amo i undying . there partes this game insainly tought . there way many puzzles - i don't mind puzzles but there simply way many . some them insainly hard . i would recomend you get jedi knight : jedi academy - way better puzzles aren't insain you get choose what you look like .... well i could go but i'll leave it there . if you aredy jedi academy you want star wars game $20 then you sould get battlefront thats anoter great game . just don't get this game .	-1

review bovey spot-on ! these games gotten more boring they go . majority this game spent looking same shells over over make same necklaces over over .... how much enough ? there no real sense scariness or danger ... just boredom ! game so short ... suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed what these games become . i loved final scene , i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never finished it without consulting walkthrough . this game just lame . i don't recommend paying full price it	-1
i read pretty good reviews this game so i bought it . i hoping something little action interesting storyline . what i got probably most boring game i ever played . - introduction/prolouge lasts 7 minutes or so , including credits . you cannot break out move on- after you set down your psp grab drink , you come back find there one short battle you play . then you go back " story " . characters long , annoying conversations you get press " " end each their sentances . again , no way break out , no in-game menu you manage game . you go through each painfully slow dialog box until " chapter " over . this game really bad . maybe it gets little more interesting ; it possible there actually something you besides watch characters argue . it really slow it all storyline dialog . there not appear any freeplay . if you played this type game before you enjoy style play , then you might like it . i bored frustrated first minute	-1
this game mindnumbingly hard not because its very challenging but rather its set up fail . most missions thrust you into situation little indication what . patients vital signs drops , you frantically poke your ds trying think what . nurse , who assists you , gives you vague ideas how before you know it you've failed mission . it would take me average 10-15 failures before i finally won mission . last mission i played made me quit , resulted 30+ failures . that only 1 hour half into game . graphics crisp clear . storyline didn't make much impression me . but i probably too frustrated pay attention . this game lot potiental but killed it constantly making you fail . not buy this game unless you extreme amount patients , game collector who keep it sealed , or you're gultton punishment . whatever you , not buy this game hype . it not live up it .	-1
this gamecube weak . i owned both nes nintendo 64 those excellent gaming systems . nintendo recent system , gamecube , several problems it design . first all , internal fan slow but , quiet . after hour or so use , system overheats , thus shuts down . second problem , wireless controllers this system suck . we tried 4 brands none worked more than week . brands we tried : pelican , intec , nintendo , osmart . third problem system not built last . i still nes nintendo 64 , which both work great ! i doubt gamecube last past 4-5 years use . simply put , don't buy this product ! also ! nintendo wii going come out soon . description specs , you need stand up interact ( move around stuff ) game . sounds fun but , would you like after hard day work ? it work something like sony eye toy .	-1

remember all those countless super hero licensed beat ' em up plagued 16-bit systems ? first glance ea marvel nemesis : rise imperfects might not seem like type game , but make no mistake it : repetitive quickly boring beat ' em up host technical issues . you play variety marvel comics heroes villains , well six " imperfects " : cyborg-esque warriors created specifically game . single player mode ungodly repetitive you battle hordes generically created enemies . this gets boring real quick , button mashing galore repetitive gameplay . destructable environments seem like good plus first , but you'll soon learn how much they actually work against you brawl , it becomes more frustrating than it should . cumbersome control scheme adds this , not mention controls get quite buggy well . graphics look sharp distance , but game odd look it like it doesn't know if it wants look like spider-man 2 or ultimate spider-man ( both great games much more worth your time than this ) , game cut scenes look godawful . there few saving graces which save marvel nemesis complete clunker , including horde unlockable content comic fans love . marvel heroes ' super powers nicely pulled off , including storm weather attacks daredevil agility , online support where most fun game . other than though , there not much else here hold your interest . if you're looking great super hero game , check out x-men legends series or aforementioned ultimate spider-man . if you're looking great beat ' em up , check out rockstar warriors ; all which more worthwhile than this	-1

i loved this game child i spent many hours playing it . i incredibly excited able play it my laptop . oops they didn ; update any drivers first two games ( kings quest 1 2 ) so after 15 minutes playing you can't see screen due all graphic errors . there no patches available yet it dosn't look like any way . i feel pretty ripped off . it says cover big print .

i loved first xenosaga . then , this arrived . episode 2 isen't bad game terms story , intro absolutely dynamite . then you get into battle . now , if you like tactical stuff , this good game you . but if you're trying fight your way through hoard enemies get save point record timing , i say save your money . gone amazingly well-done battle system first episode . its place stands completely out-of-nowhere new way battling takes 15 minutes get rid couple easy enemies ( easy ones this game around 2000 hps ) . ridiculous , but that not all . enemies weak " zones " depend height attack you inpu t.t he zones , , highest . triangle = , square = circle = -sometimes- . see what i mean ? it completely screwed-up you become deeplyaddicted game understand its full potential . if wasn't enough , they changed voice actors too . kos-mos voice sounds more like operator than robot momo sounds like brat . least , chaos ' voice improved . i'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this . i just hope namco comes out better sequel , otherwise spend your moey something else ( like shadow hearts , example ) .	-1
when disney interactive released quot ; who wants millionaire , quot ; early 2000 , they anticipated very warm response disc , which firm but low opening price . however , when actually played , game sure depress . if it isn't crudely simple , design poor uninspired . entire game essentially based one lackluster thing : regis philbin repeating same phrases over over again . quot ; sure come back ... who wants millionaire . quot ; quot ; i hope you'll join me again ... who wants millionaire . quot ; if one doesn't decide resell ( or simply trash ) this game within its first week purchase , they work disney interactive or regis themselves . don't waste your time this pitiful effort	-1
i really looking forward this game , i prepared overlook one or two things . every game it own personality , right ? i found instead this game actually doesn't much one all . i didn't mind graphics . not cutting edge sure , but not bad either . little muddy but change cartoony . it hard enjoy closeup views , however , when so many buildings lost their roof zoom . no way toggle feature . camera angles frustrating it very difficult pick anything out mouse accurately . not there much time look scenery . immigrants came . came . came . whether there houses jobs available or not . long city happiness high enough , which meant everyone happy . which they not . because they no houses or jobs . keep city happiness up only way ensure somewhat stable economy . forget planning . forget balancing resources workshops markets . it wasn't clear what balance any case . it would take trial error , you didn't time . you building worshops like mad , trying guess how many citizens would employed each , researching temporary bumps keep your city deserted droves . best income boosts not through sale goods or trade . it through research , maximising tax base development currency so . you hit those early , reached certain population level , you made money . rest time you spent trying keep people leaving . there no stability reaching any level . it quickly became game keep up . there no way control immigration or set pace development . all decorative options , more than similar games out , you really didn't care end what your city looked like , because it just cost time . money too , but really not relevant issue . unless people unhappy . then you could stick few things , quickly , somewhere . you just can't enjoy leisurely pace planning , building finishing it off nudge here there watching it run ... you constantly involved process , staying ahead curve . you don't worry maintenance , such city fires or engineers , but cities cannot not made self-sufficient or self-sustaining this inherent instability built into gameplay . five or ten minutes away screen bring most cities , if not all , screeching halt . while i enjoyed research options , ability move homes i thought great innovation , not ability control flow immigrants city pegging success city happiness makes this game poor economic simulation gameplay ultimately very shallow unsatisfying .	-1

graphics aren't most important part game me . i already owned oblivion when i bought gothic 2 because i hoping it would darker more mature " oblivion " style rpg . while it much more mature content than oblivion ,.. i never got see it because bad controls ,.. bad collision lack fun . ( bad collision i'm talking your character walking through or getting stuck objects . ) only weapons you find first tree branch tiny dagger . there no easy enemies fight level 1 character . even little gremlin looking guys first cave pond beginning totally beat crap out you ease . controls make combat unfun chore . i'm patient forgiving gamer but gothic 2 barely half quality elder scrolls 4 : oblivion . if you've never played oblivion don't xbox 360 or pc run it ,.. then maybe you'll get into gothic 2 . it much lower system requirements	-1
concept this game strong , it got some cute ideas , but voice recognition - especially word " blue " - character recognition abysmal . it makes " game " exercise frustration , more than anything else . character recognition ... unless you write whatever font game programmed recognize , it going record your answers something different than what you wrote . you penalized when system doesn't recognize " blue " or correct number . if system so rigid it only accepts one way saying " blue " , then system should sound file tells you what it wants hear . number recognition , it should screen shows you how system wants numbers written , or it should able allow you enter your numbers correlate them numbers within system . ( when i make this mark , it = 4)also , " intro " content absurdly long , no way skip over it . huge waste time after first 10x you've seen it . i just got game today , i've spent hours trying figure out way say blue such game recognize it ... now , i just wish i could return opened software . i'm very frustrated entire experience	-1
firstly , i big fan aurora engine pc based rpg games . i loved bg 1 2 plus first iwd but sequal which i found , honest , awful . i raised 2nd edition rule set i never played 3rd ( exception nwn ) but fact this game based newer set rules didn't bother me much . it computer game after all , exact mechanics system i dont understand . thing bother me this game fact it one big battle after . your commanders send you endless suicide runs . it got point where i could simply leave my game runing hour or two while my chacters could hack slash their way through tide randomly spawned criters . it got boring really fast . not too mention difficult well . really sad part , when i read general plot outline , i enthusiastic . i always wanted see what would happen if orc races banned together army attempted invade . but , when you your 5 companions only ones front lines against army ... this point where ( pen paper rpg ) i tell fellow who hiring me shove it	-1
now , before you say anything , i played this game beaten it week provided blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now unbaiased opinion . i think this game so completely stupid . it sequel retarded but again its my opinion .	-1
first game we played gamecube spongebob , battle bikini bottom . we absolutely loved it my daughter plays it over over . thinking shrek 2 would similar , we rented it . it very hard control c-stick it kept zooming out wouldn't rotate camera except certain times . charactors very distant even if we used c-stick zoom , it still wasn't close enough . it same feeling needing put eyeglasses see something more clearly ! aspect we didn't like four charactors always together you would lose track which one main charactor . maybe we're spoiled because c-stick spongebob allowed you rotate every direction see what around you graphics so good you could see facial expressions . it surprising all reviews so good because our impression completely opposite .	-1
i pretty decent computer ( athlon64/3000+ , radeon x550 ) , but this game not work all . even after i download install patch aspyr ( though there no excuse game not least load straight out box ) , spellforce . exe just sits there sucks up 99% cpu until i kill process . aspyr support unable help . said , despite other reviews here , this game not install starforce . but maybe that why my version won't work ..	-1
halo 1 steroids , halo 2 clear microsoft stamp bungie creativity control it muddies up what balanced gameplay . hackneyed single player story makes no sense , no flow , levels aren't replayable . you thought library halo1 tedious ? try headache inducing map design this game . also nonsense , unneccesary switch elite perspective half game , new group covenant bad guys look like rejects captain planet cartoon . apes mohawks , yeah , nice design . i only play one or two levels single player , they so noobish , it loses appeal quickly . multiplayer . okay , 2004 upon release , this great game . it took time go up level , ranking system wasn't abused it now . once new maps , kept harddrive ( read mod kids ) released bungie , opened door full blown chaos . now 2 years later , modding died down somewhat , but whole new slew bridging connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find game no lag . so i still play occasion , it lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you play your map choice , choose servers good connections , then modders big gun noobs find type game they want play too . i only pray halo 3 multiplayer improves this system , otherwise i'm xbox console permanently	-1

this game starforce copy protection , which software you not want your computer . reportedly , it replaces your cd and/or dvd drivers , often causes extreme hardware software problems . i've victim software problems , it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners it extremely difficult figure out what doing it . it could best game that ever produced , but anyone who starforce experience going steer clear	-1
i honestly not like cheat devices , but since wild arms 4 came out , it actually now use . let me explain ... unfortunately , thanks programming part xseed puplishing ( company translated wild arms 4 ) it impossible unlock two bonus contents game without aid this device , or similar device like gameshark . since this cheapest all said devices , if you hellbent unlocking everything game , you'll want shell out twenty dollars this . if it wasn't this reason , i wouldn't even interested this product .	-1
far i am concerned this game total garbage i would not recomend it any one . i not know why it ever released ..!! deer hunter 2003 same way i tossed both them garbage . trophy hunter 2003 much different story . game play very good graphics up par todays fast computers ..	-1

my son begged this game , price reasonable compared some games so we added it our collection . he enjoyed levels 1 2 , but once we got level 3 it ! unless you earned nickname " fast fingers " or " fury feet " don't bother purchasing this until you rent it . i spent hour trying beat level 3 my 6 year old only thing i discovered i equally well when i randomly hit 4 keys quickly possible ( 57% accurate ) i actually keeping up . this only level 3 i only imagine " dance levels " get harder here , good luck !!	-1
we bought this game knowing shrek movies bit raunchy , but thinking game would ok 6 year old play . after watching my son play this game few minutes ... i saw he stun chickens put them pot boiling water while they still alive . then after , he punched large turtles threw them tables where there backs cracked open died . i can't believe game rated everyone would little kids ( or whoever played it ) so mean animals . what next , ripping head off rabbit ? i consider myself one coolest moms around , but this totally crossed line	-1
i used love this game , but there so many better games out there , plus this game overated , not so good storyline , nerdy weapons , it just not good	-1
sure it looks good gameplay ok but final boss ( jinpachi ) really cheap lame ! even " easy " difficulty , just couple hits this freak you're dead ! devil within mini-game also stupid , some levels just impossible too hard . i wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want or least just before some critical part game but unfortunately not case here , not mention some save points hidden . imagine getting through most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles , spending around 2 hours or more get boss level , then finally finding yourself trying over over beat boss until you just give up but you can't save your game , then you're gonna redo entire level again !!! one sick stupid game design ! only reason i'm playing this mini-game just get hidden items	-1
i purchased this product my niece , positive experiences similar items , finding price too tempting . however , what hope introducing her videogames my generation turned into exercise frustration outse t.t he screw battery casing stripped very little application screwdriver , titles suffered redundancy , many them required use too many buttons . what most disappointing aspect this item potential it possessed ; perhaps fewer similar titles re-configuration button commands would ensure promise this product	-1
if you looking codes like game shark , this not you . not only you computer , if anything happens disk , you screwed . you won't able reinstall windows , or install it new computer . some games offer rewards like unlimited health %100 completion . so if those they games you plan using , this best thing out there	-1

" hey kids , fire up xbox lets watch this movie ! " what heard through households own xbox but some reason or they still 90 don't already dvd player . like my title suggests , if you already dvd player , this waste money . only reason i purchased one because my dvd player problems playing some dvd-r i got friend . i some money burn so i just wanted see if xbox dvd kit could play it determine if dvd bad burn or it just my dvd player . i found xbox able play dvd-r question no problem . however , aside those two dvd-r , all dvd i own bought retail stores , so i really no need play dvd-r , my dvd player plays normal discs perfectly . said , i only used xbox dvd playback kit once watch dvd-r i problems . because content these burned " movies " , there really no need watch them again ....... however if push comes shove i always use one my pc or mac watch burned dvd ; no need use my xbox . i meant return dvd kit next day , but never got around it . xbox dvd player good feature , but fact microsoft charges you use feature makes it not worth money ..... unless course you don't dvd player all .	-1

this game came highly recommended people who generally similar taste games me , but i'm still trying figure out why . there no question in-game graphics impressive story-line interesting . however gameplay nearly non-existant , when you happen participate some action controls either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated ( i.e. sphere grid or blitzball ) . even story often poorly told , stilted voices hilariously bad character animation . if i compare this game some squaresoft other efforts , it similar mix final fantasy 8 chrono cross . but while those two games generally frowned upon rpg enthusiasts , final fantsy recieved almost universal praise . short , i'm not so much disappointed game i am baffled its warm reception .	-1
others said , this much-anticipated game . i played caesar ii iii extremely excited when i heard iv coming out . what letdown ! i didn't any installation errors others mentioned , i haven't game crash me . however , game unplayable my system - which only year old - unless i turn down 90% advanced graphics . " unplayable " , i mean ten seconds or more waiting time you click your mouse , when game responds . even graphics turned down , i still get lag when auto-save starts . mouse-control essential when building roads or aquaducts , this aggravating extreme . it appears sierra programmers designers put lot work into upgrading graphics . too bad i can't see them ! interface horrible takes up right half screen 1280x1024 resolution . this means you must rotate map build right edge . i much prefer " tabbed " building interface other city-building games . although you build roads diagonals this game - which you couldn't earlier versions - interface not smart enough auto-rotate buildings fit roads . you click drag rotate buildings , lag - even low graphics settings - make this exercise frustration . i dislike new warehouse management panel . sliders might look cool , but they're slow ( lag ! ) . i would've liked see additional options " only store basic goods " , " only store luxury goods " , etc . this would take some pain out managing them . trade ports different also - you can't see prices ! it appears some scenarios hidden milestones you meet order advance . one i'm playing right now , i'm stuck because my prosperity rating not rise above 36 ( 50 required win ) . i over 30,000 denarii my treasury , turning hefty profit ( meeting various demands rome ) least eight years game-time . i met exceeded all other requirements victory , but prosperity continues elude me . my city almost completely automated now - only thing i respond rome requests goods or cash . my advisors nothing helpful say . it not fun if i can't advance . so while game pretty - what i see it - it got too many frustrations worth much more my time	-1
please sid -- dissapointment civiv , now railroads , say you haven't jumped " easy " bandwagon like so many other game designers . sid -- reason we purchase these games because your name them . this game seems like it made 12 year old , not someone who grown up complexities you normally build into your games . please -- next game you release , make sure it lives up standards you created . after this , just throwing your name game no longer means you print some money your bank account	-1

castlevania : dawn sorrow latest iteration konami decades-old franchise first appear nintendo ds . don't let title fool you ; this really isn't dawn anything , except maybe bunch more castlevania games ds . subtitle here simply workable way include letters title game , seems requirement platform this point . dawn sorrow actually takes place year after events aria sorrow , which came out 2003 game boy advance . if you've played game -- or if you've played just any recent castlevania game actually--you'll right home dawn sorrow , because it basically same game repackaged fit ds . isn't bad thing though , because castlevania games long carried torch good , old-fashioned 2d side-scrolling gameplay , dawn sorrow keeps flame burning bright ever . star dawn sorrow soma cruz , young adventurer who narrowly avoided becoming next dracula aria sorrow . soma ability collect souls monsters he kills , thus inheriting their powers . year after soma escaped dracula castle , mysterious woman named celia shows up attacks him . celia priestess new cult attempting resurrect dracula . since soma already proved once before he capable foiling resurrection dark lord , cult decides eliminate him before he mess up their plans well . soma survives attack quite easily celia forced retreat . apparently soma doesn't take kindly people who try kill him , so he sets out find celia prevent her reviving dracula . entire game takes place cult base , which replica dracula castle . true castlevania form you'll start off relatively weak , only knife some mediocre armor . you progress through areas castle , you'll fight monsters search mazelike hallways where you'll gain experience , well find new better equipment . you gain experience , you'll level up your stats increase attack , defense , strength , constitution , intelligence , luck . throughout game you'll also collect souls monsters you kill . these souls equipped give soma new abilities . there three types souls you equip , well ability-type souls grant you special powers without equip them . ability souls collected when you defeat bosses , these abilities usually required progress through game . using these ability souls soma learn how double-jump , move underwater , break crystal blocks -- all which required access certain areas castle . castlevania : dawn sorrow sticks close tried-and-true formula , so it instant hit anyone affinity sort explorative gameplay series known . while it doesn't much distinguish itself first castlevania ds , updated look , excellent music , added controls help refine series even further . bottom line : whether you're familiar series or not , you can't go wrong dawn sorrow .	1

i just recently bought this game $10 dollars . i always heard awsome but never even played xbox(i've ps2 fan while ) . after i played first couple levels i not dissapointed . this game simply amazing even today , i can't possibly imagine how good it must seemed back when it came out . gameplay terrific , so graphics . sound music game awsome . i highly recommend this game bought not just rented because it well worth owning	1

while i think some reviews xenosaga ii little harsh , they hit few good points . terms plot , first thing really let me down kos-mos . don't let her face covering cover game fool you . while one main characters first game , she hardly anything this game until end , which seems less like plot point more creators obliging her . same said shion well . this shift center stage hurts these characters , it really disappointing . instead , jr. takes center stage . instead shedding light events first game , it opens up whole knew set issues really don't get resolved . if you're looking story pull first game , it'll hard find this game . jr. character i personally don't care much , but if you fan him , then you'll enjoy this game , you learn lot his past u.r.t.v.a new character introduced shion brother , jin uzuki . personally , i liked jin , but you don't get use him much game . him , shion , jr. albedo , there underlying theme " brothers " or " siblings " story , although don't look much elaboration jin shion . although some people aren't pleased battle system this game , i actually enjoyed it . i caught into it quicker than first game system . you also acquire skill points out enemies ' weak zones , which i found very useful . i also liked able build up attacks , then boost really slam enemy . overall , it game i really enjoyed . game some replay value it , there certain things you actually can't accomplish until you've beaten game once . times , re-watching certain scenes over over again gets boring . yet i would recommend this series , if nothing else , it serves bridge first game upcoming third game .	-1

i am going write this review mostly those familiar original disgaea . such i not get much into aspect gameplay system game aside things changed or important note . said , let begin . game begins land veldime , alternate world first game , where evil overlord named zenon hidden well , everyone . when he came into veldime however , he placed curse land changed all humans into demons . effects weren't all immediate some still several human qualities but if curse not reversed soon , there no turning back . thus hero adell ( oddly enough only person unaffected zenon curse ) sets out defeat overlord . opening there attempt summon zenon adell so he fight him , but it goes awry zenon daughter accidentally gets summoned instead . bound adell summoning pact she no choice but accompany him castle where he intends kill her father ( albeit not without scheming bit herself ) . nutshell , story good . nothing amazing but ample opportunity humor most come love original . only really new additions battles ability stack attacks , if you quick enough , throw diagnally . basis stack attacks after building tower aliies using lift command , person bottom tower still ability attack . doing so they begin passing enemy up tower everyone taking shot him then spiking him back ground . essentially , team attack up 10 characters . there updates dark assembly 6 factions senators introduced . it easier pass some bills if you lucky since quite often some senators show up vote drunk ( random vote basically ) or even asleep ( no vote all ) . perhaps most entertaining addition though felonies . you recieve felony things such power leveling , much hp/sp/mana , or even killing your own allies . benifit felonies top any stat boosts you may get , it easier pass proposals dark assembly , every felony character they gain 1% extra exp . this works all way up 300 felonies ( 300% exp bonus ) . game made all necessary additions make gameplay top original , however my opinion there feels like something missing . characters seem bit more " book " not wonderfully absurd original . voice acting isn't quite good first disgaea ( plus etna new voice actress ... ) . despite all however , game plays much better even looks bit smoother boot . all all it great game worthy sequel amazing game . while some may like changes characters others may not , there no denying core game much better than original keep you addicted just long , if not longer	1
this controller feels great your hands . fact , after using this controller awhile , my batteries went low i switch back dualshock controller . dualshock felt wierd my hands . response controller good . i controller long time now not experienced any lag time . one down side controller i returned two controllers because they stopped working short period time . i guess 3rd time charm because this one working fine after almost year	1
using only two cordless controllers ; this one xbox 360 controller , i like this one lot more . it comfortable , small enough not too big , just right weight not too light . i couldn't ask better controller- unless logitech made wired controller leather handles into wireless one , then i'd find myself much more pleased :) buy this one , there isn't better wireless controller out there	1
this great controller . especially after all complaints microsoft got its original controller too bulky(personally speaking i never really problems even ) . but since i got xbox controller , i havent touched big one . this controller gives better grip , buttons softer their positioning better(the overall feel quite good ) . i played rallisport challenge this controller beat whole game . even game like rallisport where precision required accelaration braking successsfully master tracks , i it without any problems using this controller . also vibration feel very good . so if you looking buy xbox controller not able decide which , just go this smaller one , controller without any hesitation . quality hardware	1
i've only this controller few days , i found layout same black controller . i wish thumb controls little softer , they hurt my thunb while playing exciting game	-1
ok-i not review any other comments this game before posting this . i playing final fantasy games very long time ... i still ( play :p ) mystic quest , final fantasy ii ff iii snes . ff xii best final fantasy since #3 ( us ) , my opinion ... it fun !!!! story line awesome ( kinda like shakespeare meets king arthur ) it reminds me bit final fantasy 3 ... only awesome graphics ! my one peeve all games leveling up ( hp mp . ) i felt like after i mastered " new " way doing i t-t hey changed it next game !!! old games it automatically ... after those , you equip things order gain strength , magic , special abilities . this game combines what you already learned ff vii ... if you never played game , there great tutorial you access any time . this game just plain fun ... i think most fun since ff iii . you freedom explore wander without getting lost ( there reminder bottom map x show you where go ) , you see whatever you come into contcact ( friends foes ) , storyline gameplay phenomenal	1
not really into original gta iii ( its birds-eye-view predecessors ) , i became unfortunately addicted san andreas . game play absorbing storyline cinematics , despite dated graphics , engaging . maybe most impressive aspect entire game impressive cinematic scene voice acting , which makes you forget some jerky animations . game play free-ranging , but if you don't pursue main storyline missions ( which linear , but multiple storylines let you pursue them any priority ) gratuitous violence you commit ultimately unrewarding difficult get away ( it should ) . moral criticisms game include able randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions , but most part , there repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so . my criticism would there not enough repurcussions street violence , because it would certainly make aspect game more challenging . if you go rampage local store , clerks don't try call police or evade . they instead just take beating or bullet . ai some rival gangs little clumsy too , they simply start shooting you if they see your colors , despite presence squad cars or bike cops across street . cops san andreas corrupt , but not corrupt . gta sa definitely feels like ported title rather than game developed pc . some interface in-game menus awkward designed ps2 gamepad friendly . saving game bit pain well , since you retreat your " safe-house " save everytime . fun engrossing game adults , but let this known : if you let your under-18 child play this game , you awful parent deserve social services come whisk your precious babies away . aside violence , san andreas rife profanity innuendo , probably not really suitable anyone under 40 . there no " safe " mode or low-gore level this game like some other titles ( while game overly violent , gore minimal anyway )	1
this great cable your hd tv while playing you sony playstation 2 . it give very crisp clear images , much better than cable comes playstation .	1
there no denying star wars battlefront one best video game series currently available . first game really amazing , let us participate some places seen all six movies . but , even though game really fun , it felt like there something still missing . missing piece put this result . this not disappoinment , but best ! unlike first game when main story gameplay just caputring bases killing all enemy forces , here , there actually missions complete . retrieve data-discs , killing rebel leaders , this game more indepth than it predecessor . game , there still times when bases captured , like first game , but you no longer kill all enemies . coolest part game you get ride different ships other things movies . lots fun !! so , overall , this game really improvement over first but some may prefer first more . reason first game basically kill everyone take their bases , less seen here focus more protecting things stealing things .	1
this game great when you group friends come over . it really breaks ice you anybody you may not familiar it incredibly entertaining . i suggest this game everybody	1
i don't know how extoll praises this game loudly enough . we plugged it christmas morning entire family friends playing it ever since . selection songs excellent . sing dance feature brings sends this game way out front earlier editions ( which we also ) . eye toy good addition . just everything it first rate . i can't think single drawback . my only suggestion you purchase game make it experience entire family , parents too	1

wow !!! this game so freaking cool !!! colossi amazing ! i've played my share games , i honestly say i've never encountered creatures like these before . i'm only halfway thru game , ( slain 7 colossi 9 more yet go ) , yet each new colossus i meet astounds me all over again . one thing them , i never felt other games , they envoke sympathy towards them . until you find them their own little area their world , they just giant hulks resting peacefully , bothering no one . but once disturbed , they awaken , you must figure out how take each one down . i actually feel sad when they fall . supposedly your character must take them down resurrect his lifeless lover , however i get sense there twist this story before it ends . equally awe-inspiring aspect this game environment which you playing . it without compare most beautiful , mystical , unbelievably gorgeous landscape i've seen any game , ever . world looks , feels , sounds like ancient place time . you just experience it . this one those games i'll remember years today play all over again . this game work art , just certain films ; plus it just so freaking cool !!! don't miss it	1
i hesitated good while before picking this game up bargain price . based upon various reviews player feedback , i assumed this game would like 10 hours long , bit buggy , dumbed down . fortunately , none this case . i some good fun this over weekend ( yes , it finished over weekend ) didn't come across single bug . fable not same league morrowind , oblivion , gothic 2 , or some other great roleplaying games ( rpg ) out there , but it provide enjoyable diversion . gameplay : controls typical wasd keys mouse commands found most single-player rpgs . game fairly easy learn navigate . story traces hero childhood through adulthood , when he'll , you know , save world . there no character classes per se , but you roughly play warrior , magic-user , or stealth/archer character , or some mixture these . much story centers around main quest line , but there number side quests available . unlike most rpgs , quests assigned quest cards you pick up heroes guild ( lol ! that what it actually called ) . it rather artificial-feeling system , but it functional . progression game quite linear . most instances , you not able even leave beaten patch , since fences , rocks , invisible barriers won't allow it . compared more open-ended rpgs like elder scrolls series , fable seems restrictive light weight this regard . overall , it decent story , but it rather force-fed you . game includes several interesting touches . people react you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds . if you roleplay like saint , you'll eventually halo butterflies floating around . ladies ( guys ) worship you , you option buy home marry ( multiple times if you'd like ) . if you play evil character , you'll eventually grow horns fall out favor polite company . nonplayer characters game , least towns , jobs schedules . they work during day sleep night , though only quest-related characters anything say interest . although you only play game same guy , you customize him tattoos , facial hair , haircuts , ( small ) assortment armor . you control how your character skills develop , but not deeply you game like morrowind or baldur gate . there other small things you , such fish , play games chance , treasure hunt . overall , this game takes 20-25 hours everything it offer , so it rather short rpg . things i didn't much care not major , but simply underscore light-weight nature this particular game . game certainly designed appeal adolescent crowd , hotkeys burping , farting , so forth . various tattoo styles haircuts further highlight this point . there nothing really offensive game ; it just feels bit immature places . also , save system based mostly checkpoint model . you can't save just anywhere ( least your quest progress not save ) , but game autosave important junctures . graphics : game looks quite good . character models convincing ( though bit cartoonish often repeated ) , natural environment screenshot beautiful some places . since pathing fairly restrictive , much scenary noninteractive . it not like oblivion or gothic 2 , where if you see it then you probably travel it . sounds : voice acting pretty good , usual british accents invariably seem accompany such games . music particularly well appropriate various atmospheres . ambiant sounds also decent . replayability/technical issues : game probably worth playing twice : once good guy once bad guy . it play similarly either way , but there different ways perform certain quests depending your moral disposition . technically , game perfectly stable my computer -- no freezes , crashes , or other problems . manual decent explains much game , in-game tutorial . if you like rpg games get this one cheap , go it . it well-polished , though simple , rump through fairly well rendered world . don't expect same character depth , engrossing story , or exploring options you'll find some games i mentioned above . however , fable : lost chapters good several hours entertainment .	-1
i would 5 this one all way , because i enjoyed game immensly ( general idea game ) , but because personal preference i stopped playing it because excessive gore , sexual/debasing themes , leud art . if you like this game but don't want all questionable material ( yes , i know it nothing compared other games ) then may i recommend " fate " wildtangen	1
there isn't whole lot i add other reviews , but i disagree when some say this game challenging . i bought this game week ago i've already beaten it . no guide , no internet walkthroughs , no cheats . honestly , that never case me any gta game i've played . heck , i'm still trying beat san andreas ( i play straight up no cheats or guides/helpers ) i've game over year now . ending kind cheesy too , but it still good game makes great pacifier until next gta comes out . $20 , you can't really go wrong anyway	-1
i bought this one same time i baten kaitos origins i say it don't hold up original but comes close . you tell square their hands this one , i liked 2-d style first one 3-d graphics very impressive but dont really fit gameplay . my 4 star overall comes again battle system . it holds true 1 button controls 1 character but movement system needs go . it uses full range system like star ocean but changes " attack view " fighting similar original . ultimate magic those really awesome super moves still intact . im not far into game they already 2 characters original star here thats arngrim lezard valeth , which cool they 2 my favs , i cant wait see all characters . if make valkyrie profile 3 : hrist i would like see return hand drawn sprites riddence movement system . `	1
truth , there really hasn't great mana game since secret mana back 1993 . every mana game since met astonishing mixed feelings , children mana no different . why i buy it knowing this ? same reason many mana fans continue invest mana games . there always hope next installment give us same joy secret mana . unfortunately , children mana not this . it doesn't rekindle magic secret mana gave us , but shouldn't suggest it falls short it either . world peril when mana imbalance threatens send world back into dark ages . it up hero or heroine stop this happening thus you'll set out save mana tree world itself . children mana no means great storyline going it . least where it falls short story it more than makes up gameplay . no matter how you look it , children mana dungeon crawler . it rpg , but it falls into dungeon crawling category . when you enter dungeons they're just swarming monsters , you'll surrounded before you know it . so you'll make your way through dungeon battling everything sight until you reach boss , take him , then you're . rinse repeat . process , times become annoying , but children mana offers some variety interesting aspects gameplay make up it . first tidbit interest how combat works . it actually pretty fun go through dungeons killing things . it surprisingly addictive first couple hours . you've got three hit combos you perform enemies . you knock enemies into other enemies . there quite bit intersting things you . however , what also sets it apart lot dungeon crawlers you can't ahead yourself too fast . first foremost , you can't equip use everything you find right off bat . game actually restrict you using overly powerful weapons until you access certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations . this keeps game too simple . you'll also access magic , course . each time you go into dungeon you take spirit you use magic spirit provides you . it interesting play around well . dungeons you also dual wield weapons , although not way you'd think . when i say duel wield i specifically mean you equip two weapons but only use one each time . so you can't go swinging both them same time , which probably would've added more variety gameplay otherwise . lines giving your character different assortment weapons , you also give them gems improve their stats or combat abilities . it interesting , but not really all deep . you'll mostly find or purchase these gems . interesting aspect game completely linear should you decide dwell into many sidequests game offer . children mana not shy offering you side missions go , they're actually pretty well worth it . problem gameplay , however this rinse repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast . objective just every dungeon find what called " gleam drop " then bring it back " gleam well . " it annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out same way . fight through horde enemies , retrieve gleam drop , fight boss leave . over time it becomes increasingly repetative . however , children mana great remedy too . it multiplayer . up four players play time , game so much more fun way . you your friends make your way through dungeons together , sometimes it just blast . there moments slowdown when playing multiplayer mode , but it nothing get too frustrated , because it doesn't happen too often . multiplayer alone adds lot variety complexity gameplay . far graphics go game doesn't look too bad . sprites look like they're ripped straight ouf sword mana ... game completely 2d . however , mana games not taking graphics limit , they've its unique art style , which children mana absolutely gorgeous . it artwork just beautiful look . each environment given extremely good detail . only problem , i mentioned , sprites not nearly detailed . musically , children mana sounds fantastic . it one best sounding ds games out date . very few current games hold candle up it fantastic soundtrack . bottom line simple : children mana very fun game play very mediocre storyline . there just enough variety interest gameplay keep one going adventure , even if storyline just not all great begin . however , keep mind children mana really just dungeon crawl , it uncrealistic expect rpg that all dungeon crawling fantastic storyline blow you away . whole , if you're looking game that fun , you'll find it children mana . however , if you're looking game deep storyline endearing characters , you won't find it children mana . good+beatiful artwork+fantastic soundtrack+there lot variety gameplay+multiplayer blasts+tons sidequests dothe bad-the storyline isn't good-the gameplay lot vareity , but it hard get past fact it repetativ	-1

i played this game some friends out-of-town , seriously acquire ps2 just satisfy my craving . not shooter game , not rpg , you just roll . seriously . it surprisingly awesome actually - but my big disappointment came when after 2 days mildly committed playing , it . i'd beat it , i'm really not big gamer . i don't know how much mileage i'm really gonna get out sort limited 2-player mode . maybe sequel better - i hope	1
... not just half-baked product placement tool . bioware decision make game pre-date movies great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom , even within confines star wars brand . biggest reason why kotor won over 40 game-of-the-year awards ( yes , over 40 ) not because you get swing double-bladed lightsaber around use force powers ; it because story ! strong plot crucial every rpg , kotor doesn't disappoint . this plot course includes one biggest twists video game history ( all you fans out there know what i'm talking ! if you don't , then go out buy this game now ) . game principal characters , while somewhat stereotypical ( i.e. bastila condescending socialite snob , carth tough loner troubled past , etc ) , work very well together good chemistry , including you , created character . example , if you play female character , it soon becomes obvious carth develops feelings you , but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago . you'll also find yourself acting mediator when some your allies don't get each other , i.e. canderous carth , because they fought opposite sides mandalorian wars took place five years before . aside character development , game feels very rich its " star wars-ness " -- example , some names bioware came up planets people feel sound like george lucas himself approved them . despite what i said earlier this review , cutting down your enemies lightsaber looking good doing it got one joys kotor . i admit when i first got dantooine verge becoming jedi , i trembling excitement i going build my own lightsaber , i wondered what color i going choose . said all , there some things keep this game getting 5 stars . i felt game bit linear ( able choose your planets any order only gives illusion open-ended gameplay ) . i hoping storyline would different depending whether i decide evil or good , but everything plays same , save few minor events certain conversations . also , there " doorway bug " causes you sometimes get stuck when moving through doorway or narrow corridors . when this happens you wiggle thumbstick free yourself ; i've never any real problems this bug , but it get distracting . also i found moving around menu screens problematic ; you press start go main menu , then you pull trigger buttons move screens , but often i pull trigger multiple times before game responds . also , i'm sure many people would agree game graphics not up xbox standards ; even ps2 capable doing better ! i don't usually gripe graphics , but textures some background buildings taris downright laughable . overall , i give bioware serious kudos taking daunting task like creating new star wars game , i sing their eternal praises actually making it fun . it not stretch say i bought xbox just play kotor ( few other titles , but that story ) , i'm glad i made investment . hey , stop reading this go play	-1
this game delightful choices dialouge great you turn most conversations hillarious situations . there so many options what class sith you would like become if you go down dark side , or what class wimpy jedi you would like become if you choose light . either way game great , if you become sith lord get power perform " force crush " your opponent you very lucky ... give this game whirl	1
no way should children playing this game . it mature players subject matter could confuse younger players . goals harming people , picking up hookers , breaking law , blast long everyone knows it just fantasy . many people go into details so i'll make this short . good time while pretending bad guy who unforgivable acts . but there no way i would consider this game anyone under 15 , then i would know teen handle fantasy .	-1
i've played it countless times arcade i think it one best games ps2 ( cause actually i'm more pc gamer ) amd it best it kind . if youre looking guncon game , this you ! gameplay : i've said , best its kind . tc3 one few guncon games keep you glued tv ( my case , arcade screen ) hours hours wont get repetitive . multi-weapon system give you more strategy less ( good way , ) mindless crazy shooting . example , if you outnumbered closed space lot foes screen , any other guncon game youd shoot them all down one one , ducking like madman losing time but now , youd just select nade launcher , aim , clear area enemies . but , grenade launcher limited amount ammo , so would you spray uzi fast rate fire or use shotgun spreads its bullets ? your choice . but strategy doesnt bore game , you still ave plenty time shoot people silly graphics : graphics arent like half life 2 or doom 3 but its still isnt horrible , anyway , you wont mind graphics when youre really playing game . sound : dialog crappy like any other guncon game , but everything else above par again , you wont care sound when youre really playing gamestory : not best , its predictable , corny it isnt complex all , but if you're looking great storyline guncon game ... you need serious help . overall : only flaws i could find game overpriced , ( 60$) guncon pretty fragile ( what i've heard ) . other than , its must buy anyone who likes shooting , crazy action , or wants let their anger out some terrorists	1
you already knew it good game becuase it final fantasy , probably biggest most popular series history video games . this one probably little worse than best final fantasy games ( such iii vii ) but , despite , what you here game boy advance rpg graphics actually aren't bad , storyline pretty good too . you just can't go wrong final fantasy games .	-1
after incredible " monkey island " series halted , i feared i would never find series games such imaginative storylines , entertaining dialogue , lush scenery . then " bully " came , i hooked . this really great game , you shouldn't set against it because it really nothing all like grand theft auto . there no blood , no sexuality ( except kissing ) , there so many involving engrossing storylines . characters also some best i've ever seen , each their own stories personality . whole clique thing also reminds you your days high school . get bully -- it awesome game . people who like this game should also look " monkey island " series games pc ps2 , " nancy drew " series pc	1
well after all media attention bully arrived . it would seem all those nutty parental groups wrong again . may now they'll focus some real problems facing our poor children . not only this game prove not " columbine " handbook it tries show better way deal problems facing teens . well rant over now rave . game mechanics excellent . like many rockstar titles they've improved gta engine allowing smoother play . stepping away mission types gta series bully better ideas without falling back gta typical ta/wholesale killing . now don't get me wrong i enjoy gta series , most rockstar other releases . i never passed shop class though . seeing gta open ended engine applied series just shows me various directions they go far game creation . mini-games fun addictive . i wish they would other classes represented . bully you get not only play great game , but some us old folks travel back simpler time . overall this excellent game , worth your time , fine example how stupid media those parental groups .	1

good-it fairly good graphics-the franchise very real you play it up 30 seasons . -it bunch new features madden 05 didn't like , truck stick nfl superstarthe bad-once you've played this awhile you'll realize john madden al micheals say same thing every game . it get old . -when you look into crowd game , graphics suck . it looks like big blob colors overall it really fun game . i hope madden 07 better though .	-1
after 8 hours play so far , i gotten lot more enjoyment out this game than i when reading first three books series ( which themselves probably took less than 8 hours read ) . where shall i begin describing this really fun game ? 1 . characters themselves realistically animated , sunny animations especially amusing , way she bites things , squeals , little dances , etc . i've smiled laughed lot just how well characters represented . 2 . voices very good , including use some major actors appearing upcoming film , although their use not pervasive during normal game play . 3 . scenario great fun - far more involving than books so far ! playing piano break it apart get it open real riot !!! settings creepy , little roaches crawling , rats spiders such . 4 . game reaches level art !! who soundtrack ? music awesome wondrous ! after dingy mansion count olaf , there episodes light relief fill player sense peace wonder - library scene , uncle monty house garden . garden butterflies flapping , grass blowing , wondrous music playing , big tree adventure klaus flying over greenery , rivers , etc . finally made me see this video game reaching level artistic accomplishment - like good painting , just get lost enjoy all details sensory input . wow ! first i concerned i might get through game too quickly . after 8 hours though only midway through , i know i'm getting my $40 worth , i surely play through whole thing more than once just one watches favorite video or takes hike favorite forest path . i calculate $2 per hour , this game giving far better return than seeing film theater when it comes out ( although i plan too ) . that not even counting game resale value afterward ! addition , there some special game features tie film - players eventually awarded film photos , information , a/v film ... one extra note game players i don't think players get great deal benefit bradyguide this game . game guide poorly mapped far comprehensive , while instruction manual comes game itself gives enough instruction detail allow players start proceed . save yourself $15 avoiding bradyguide , because map you make yourself while playing likely far more useful . halfway through game so far , i only got two useful tips guidebook , i would figured those clues out my own anyway ..	1
i've gta fan few years now me , san andreas got best one . first time you swim !! i fell into water accidently discovered this new action character . graphics more real making it kind " funky " controlling game but after awhile you'll get used it . language terrible ( more so this gta version ) so young kids should avoid this like plague .	1

i quite unsure whether buy film or not i didn't think it going my type film . but i bought game anyway although i hadnt yet seen film . anyway im glad i ! it only took me two days complete but although it isnt long long , it very good beginning end , basically going round different rooms house doing different things which may seem borin , actually it really fun ! activites etc great ! it definately good game if you like more adventurous games arent too hard , like me , too hard games arent really my type ! now i so cant wait see film which i recently bought	1
this memory card holds enough game files any gamer use but it way overpriced . i didn't worry this because mine came my ps2 . it hold 40 files , thats 1 file each game . if you over 40 games , like me , you should consider getting value pack comes 2 memory cards . if you buy two black ones , it very expensive you get two memory cards confused . value pack pretty good deal you get red blue memory card so its less confusng .	-1

nfsu capture idea ' building racing cars ' but i think they could go little further into design your so-called ' pimp-mobile ' . only interior you get design trunk , i think they could least seats , or wheel . outside design a-ok . anything sideskirts multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce . plot-line single player mode really dosen't go deep , your just some guy who wants get his title back . multi-player you race your own cars tracks you already won , but down-side whole graphics two player horrible . it game worth getting , but you might sell it later .	-1

here blast nostalgia your gameboy advance . final fantasy iv advance aka final fantasy ii aka final fantasy iv hard-type treat old-school rpg players . back its hayday , final fantasy iv gold standard what rpg should . first series remakes wonderful streak snes final fantasies , final fantasy iv back better than ever . story good it ever . final fantasy 4 what final fantasy 2 ( japanese numbering ) tried : mixed well developed story memorable characters good if simple gameplay . this story cecil dark knight who renounces his loyalty corrupt kingdom baron . baron making war against other nations world capture four elemental crystals . when his king commands him kill innocent , cecil sets out quest make things right take him around world , center earth , moon . he unravels mystery who really behind actions baron , he joined cast over ten playable characters . each them reason join fight . characterization may not seem much today standards , but this game made age when square believed less more . you revealed motive once then you moved instead going over over same psychological problem again again . unlike playstation port absolutely no upgrades beyond its retranslated script , ff4advance few minor visual tweaks . some game sprites seem tweaked abit more definition character portraits redrawn put dialogue boxes indicate who speaking . most new portraits fairly close old ones , edge rydia actually improvement , but new one rosa , paladin cecil , edward particular aren't so nice look . there also two new dungeons ability tackle final boss any other ( still living ) playable characters than fixed party five like original . all these new features very unobtrusive so you take advantage them if you'd like extra challenge or ignore them altogether . instead using script original release contained numerous spelling grammatical mistakes censored due nintendo america then extremely strict guidelines , ff4a contains more accurate revamped version . course , " you spoony bard " line , thankfully , left intact . it classic . if not one issue i'd say this undoubtedly best version game available . final fantasy iv really hard game . ff4a not hard all- least early game . i don't know if difficulty scaled back because they thought people didn't want waste gba battery life hours leveling up or because i've played this game many times before , but it just seemed too easy . anyone whose played it when it first came out should remember least super tough boss battle it baigan , magnus sisters , evil wall or something else . this time through they where like cake walk . also it seems active time battle set up such way it gives your party advantage . your party seems regain their turns twice fast enemy . half-way through game , legendary difficulty starts creeping back final trek core moon you'll thankful any break game give you . final fantasy iv shows this port it stands test time . instead feeling hoary , old , outdated , it feels just much fun it fifteen years ago .	1
i always hear these things , mainly point it unrealistic , noone uses teamwork , people too preoccupied their stats , etc , etc . may true many public servers , though there quite few aren't filled morons , actually people who play teamlike fashion , complete their objective over killing off enemy time given . i am one those people who actually go objective . actually , i am admin server , if terrorist last , camping out round , then i slay him warn him stay task . onto point- many people claim this so unrealistic , it may true points like m249 slow shooter , very cumbersome , too good aim standing up , fact you die 2 shots toe awp- those all unrealistic points , but if you think it , how much fun would it unload 5 clips half killt he enemy ? * cough halo cough * yes , i just insulted halo , because enemies too damn strong , it drives me crazy , multiplayer so annoying you shoot enemy 3 shots sniper kill ... my final point there people who aren't just preoccupied their stats , there servers dedicated fun- yes , fun , counterstrike . they whole slew crazy maps , ways make it even more insane , things such . if you interested try custom map servers . all-in-all this game peak perfection- not even mentioning huge amounts customization involved this game , weapons player models	1

this praise game , rolled into other praises . now , you've read synopsis others : your character prince ( or one his cousins ) rolls orb ( i.e. katamari ) , which collects every object level . this game works many levels , it first foremost absurd bewildering . introductory animations cut scenes off-the-wall yet amusing . incessant rolling cathartic addictive , bonuses involve finding hidden presents cousins level . there many variations rolling theme game ( roll sumo wrestler into food , roll snowball onto snowman , roll fireflies into kid reading light , time trials , etc ) , but most satisfying original premise rolling everything anything into large ball possible . once you start consume people , trucks , skyscrapers , ships , clouds , etc , then you feel very powerful . music very catchy , something vacant many video games . my only criticism : cooperative two player mode venture into frustration quite easily . my wife i played , who both good game , but you often find yourself awkwardly slowing moving where you want . that part problem , where you want roll may not where other person wants roll ... so communicate well	1

brilliant remake original classic ! although i am avid fan first doom ... i strongly urge you not juxtapose two . if you sit back pick apart differences them , you'll never enjoy doom 3 . why this game well worth buy ? many reasons . superb graphics first you'll notice . environment rich detailed . don't worry whether or not your computer handle it . you easily build one easily capable running game full settings less than $900 ... if you're comp so old you can't run it like this ... you may due upgrade anyways . weapons great very realistic . like real world , your arsenal must reloaded after so many rounds fired . handy pair digits help you monitor your clip total ammo any weapon though . so , plan ahead keep your guns fully loaded . endless series hallways some people complaining ... it makes absolutely no sense stadium set up mars research base . game offers plenty larger rooms adequately utilize heavier weapons such rocket launcher without blowing your own face off . ambient sounds game more than enough keep you edge your seat . dead bodies randomly levitate fly across room , grates knocked around unseen forces betruger haunting laugh often accompany many these ghostly actions more . enemies fierce , enemies bad ( fearful ) , any one them go easy kill downright lethal . you may not get very many good looks them , but you really shouldn't trying admire pixels something that trying kill you . take screenshot look later if you want take what monsters look like . experiment your arsenal ... learn best weapon job conserving ammo won't problem all . big issue most people seem lighting . yes , 22nd century you'd expect marines lights mounted their weapons . id software isn't stupid ... flashlight all your guns would made game lot easier lot less fun . switching your light your gun ... game forces you choose able see enemy able attack enemy . remember , this game " horror " genre . horror thrives you asking questions like " where it ? what it ? where it gonna pop out next ? " go rent horror movie you'll see what i mean . it dark ! doom 3 meant like this . buy game ... or borrow it buddy . turns lights off turn volume up . if you like horror ... it pull you right .	1

no other game looks or plays like this ; missions locations varied colorful ; villians range fat guy dynamite strapped his person corrupt law officials ; , usual , rockstar keeps game play challenging but not overly frustrating ; lots unlockables offer high replay . this one most unique best looking games any system , period . i still throw this one every 6 months go thru . story straightforward engaging ; lots really interesting concepts(machinegun coffin , crazy midgets , whole ' dead-eye ' thing ... ) it controls very well . great game outstanding company . hopefully sequel works .	1

i using basic linksys wireless game adapter my 360 , it worked fine . however , it needed connected pc firmware updates ( making it impossible mac users ) , generally more difficult set up than " official " adapter microsoft . i ended up getting this adapter sale , setting it up snap . it gets decent throughput , saves some energy over external adapter , because it only uses power when you xbox 360 . it also nice see this supports wpa networks . if your time valuable you , this probably worth extra few dollars over similar products . you just snap it , enter your network password , you're off .	1

always , nancy drew games not disappoint . personally , i quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams , if no other reason than keep my cash flow going , tour rest town . i must admit , i bit confused why herinteractive wouldn't incorporated courthouse into game some purpose , but hey , it nice see they penchant detail . after all , what town doesn't courthouse ? heh . indeed , this game could designed twice enduring ( there several ways this could accomplished ) , but honest , enduring not equate endearing . every nd game satisfied me many levels , even if few levels left wanting . i also enjoyed going back time 1930 , albeit there few inconsistencies regarding what took place when , i.e. , turntable revolving wrong way , et al . ... however , good detective notice these faux pas . like i say , there rarely any disappointment when it comes nancy drew games . one only hope they continue create these games indefintely . my only gripe they come out only two games year . my wish would four or five . :	1

so you're looking nba game but don't know which one get ? i shall sort through good bad offered both nba live 2006 nba 2k6 . two i played ( live ' 06 2k6 ) , i honestly say nba 2k6 better buy me . $20 i've countless hours some most joyous moments some most frustrating . however , nba 2k6 more all-around basketball game . if you're good offense poor defense chances good you won't win many games you might think . but if you're only good defense horrible offense , you won't win much then either . you basically play even game altogether ( this based all-star level ) . fans offensive-minded games , look no further than nba live 2006 . basic controls straight-forward easy get hang so there won't any real problems newcomers series ( such myself ) . best aspect featured live ' 06 undoubtedly freestyle superstars . my favorite team 76ers see allen iverson pulling off moves he real life game nothing short rush . highlight when you're left wide open shot , chances extremely good you'll drain it . whereas 2k6 , you still basically perfect release . overall look each game , i'd say nba 2k6 steals well . when you're looking allen iverson ( or any other player matter ) there no question who you're looking . he got his tattoos , his cornrows , mustache , everything . nba live 2006 , other hand , almost tends look childish times . don't get me wrong , graphics dunks awesome look , but you're dribbling upcourt i can't help but think player arms too long . course , could just me . 2k6 also seems more realistic courts ( i could without shots fans though ) . nba 2k6 pros : -fantastic gameplay-the more you play more you learn , making it game you invest time in-the graphics great-when you turn up difficulty it actually gets hardernba 2k6 cons : -offseason legacy mode kind lame-too frustrating times-when other team run , it nearly impossible hit anything other than lay-up-loading time almost ridiculousnba live 2006 pros : -easy anyone pick up play-freestyle superstars-commentary lot better than 2k6-dunks fairly easy execute make some excellent highlightsnba live 2006 cons : -camera angle horrible-far too offensive-minded-almost too easy times-fouls called too liberally youso there you it , fairly unbiased view each game . if live ' 06 drop down $20 i'd highly recommend it , because reality , it really fun play . but $30 i'm not sure if it worth every penny . plus , 2k6 great street ball mode addition legacy mode , so live 06 ever really chance	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction:i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released consoles very high quanitites , so you're likely gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available consoles very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame consular version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan	-1
... but game too simple too short . i like creature kapu cave better than danger design . while i appreciate quality graphics , sound effects , music , it seems like producers nancy drew games changed hands recent years . we're seeing stark difference newer games compared their past games such : shadow ranch , danger deception island , treasure royal tower , etc . ( those games fantastic ! ) recent games , play not fluid , tasks too simple-minded , there not much mystery or suspense ( if any ) , game play time too short . ' creature ' , you collect shells make necklaces you go fishing - long you want ! or until you get bored it . beach water graphics cool . there some humor some character conversations . i enjoyed . you get move four locations intertwine make sense . i didn't see any problem auto-switching ( via cell phone calls ) nancy hardy boys . not problem me . i almost rated this 3 star , but gave it 4 due graphics , characters , variety locations . hopefully , her interactive hear their customers disappointments revamp upcoming games . fans want nancy drew games keep coming	-1
great remake , but where fast forward ! my kingdom fast forward button ! this great game ! cut scenes nice touch helped draw player into story line , but would someone please give me fast forward/skip button . i understand makers game want you get involved appreciate storyline , but without fastforward/skip button , this game game limited replay value . i already played through game once , now i am running through it again , i am going insane ! long cut scenes , seemingly endless , " next " clicks fine first time , but come ! game 3 different endings you would figure developers would give you break ! ok , now i said , lets get back review . character development use magical items , while definitely not unique , but they helped flesh out fight scenes . combos skills moves made game interesting kept me coming back . while i would liked see graphics slightly change when different equipment used ( swords , helms , etc ) combat special moves graphics definitely nice . should you buy ? sure if you like rpg game definitely buy , but fore warned ... prepared read , read , read , click click click , before you even get your first fight scene , even then expect much same long before you get things your own	-1

this great memory card people only few gcn games but those who bigger collection either need buy two or gcn memory card 1019	1
these 2 games probably ( my opinion anyway ) best ones series . i review each game seperatly then make my comments collection itself . ff5 : one previously unreleased ff games ( time anyway ) now america . i really like choosing classes because it raise replay value through roof . i literally trained my characters ( this during beginning middle game ) get level 30 or 40 ( can't remember exactly ) just get my jobs mastered . storyline good well because unlike some other ff games , this one sticks one you need get rid ( x-death ) rather than fighting final battle against someone you no clue what makes character so evil why your fighting him/her instead one who destroying world . bad thing this game lack characters ( there only 5 entire game , you stick 4 , one them dies replaced his granddaughter ) so prepared look same 4 characters screen also not menu change characters . ff6 : i think this best one series . there absolutly no real " main " character this game . those who confused , what i mean , well example , ff7 you 9 characters but leader character cloud ( one you see control fields majority game ) , well this game you 4 different characters your party you ability put any character leader . characters excellent this game , i pretty much like all them ( gau funny , but he doesn't best abilities one secret characters you can't even control them all during battle ) . sabin blitz ability . those you who playing fighting games years pretty good understanding this but sadly when you make move , no matter which direction your facing , you still hae put same command same direction . instance , one moves rlr ( i am talking right left right control pad ) if your character facing right , then you insert command , but if you facing opposite direction , it still same command ( not opposite combination ) . when i first beat game , before beating it , i got all characters level 99 . this game also some best music ff game ( time anyway ) . collection itself : you get music cd , random battle screen like ff7 8 random battle loading screen , ff6 bonus menu looking stats enemies , cgi cinemas , ff5 pretty much like super nes ( or should i say super famicom ) version just exception random battle loading screens psone style opening cinema no extra bonuses because game never released usa square probably wanted people experience it without huge bunch bonus features . overall : if you like snes ff games , this right collection you ( chronicles which includes ff4 ( ff2 usa snes ) chrono trigger	1

this game just freakin ' awesome . im not big into video games , i really only play them when i someone play against ... i stay away one player mode because i get bored cannot talk smack . then came duty . i played this game through all difficulty modes , medium up never got bored . plus , if you've got nice group folk play way separate screens prevent looking , multiplayer sweet ( esp if you break up into teams ) you talk smack all day long . best graphics gameplay any game ive ever seen	1
call duty 2 puts you role three different people - vasili , john davis , bill taylor - during three highly intense but different ww2 campaigns . you see war through each these soldiers eyes , so otherwords , its first person shooter . anyway , you get lot authentic ww2 weapons which include panzershreks , mp40s , m1 garands , thompsons , etc you get shoot blow up things like halftracks tiger tanks . ontop , you get smoke frag grenades toss around . there multiplayer which pretty fun - you pick team ( ie : british , nazis , americans .. you get it ) go toe toe friend or friends random places ww2 history . objectives each level sually require you either clear out houses room room , snipe out mortar teams , fend off massive german counterattack , or place bomb something . its pretty fun intense because you'll fighting off wave after wave nazis artillery while trying achieve your goal , but it becomes sorta repetitive during later levels .. i want stress word " intense " this game . you always your toes , always firing hordes enemies . this game isn't easy , even easy difficulty , ridiculously hard veteran difficulty . hardest my opinion american campaign during battle point du heuc ... if you think medal honor : frontline arnhem knights level difficult , wait till you see this . also , this game pretty long so don't try rushing it hah . moving , you'll fighting very detailed wartorn areas such egypt , france , russia , even germany . i impressed beautiful looking enviroments when up close , character models look amazing . however , levels feel kind linear . you pretty limited where you go , but i guess we look past tha t.t he sound effects great - i really loved explosions . voice acting great , actually helpful because your allies would like " kraut 2nd floor , black building " basically point out enemies you . what lowered this game 9 ? well starters its genre basically played death . ontop guns weren't very accurate nor some them seem very powerful . i felt ripped off when i shot guy bar he just sort kelled over , got up shot me again . meh . also , like i mentioned , objectives started get repetitive . ending kind rip off first - simple news reel explaining how allies won - but once credits roll , real ending begins . it shows bunch troops battling it out some destroyed city againt tanks , nazis , airplanes . it like watching movie . sum it all up , if you got x-box 360 then you need play this game . it isn't best my opinion , but it sure lot fun . go buy it	-1
this game awesome . i love play it , i play it everyday . school it gets me way far ahead , much quicker too math . only thing puts game rate overall 4 stars one games you speak out , sometimes it won't take your answer . this happens sometimes , but it kind stinks because your getting tested , so when it won't take it it counts it wrong . but i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you buying this game . it kill alot time . long trips i always take it , whenever i get my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing ds ? it totally rocks ! i used get car sick because i bored , just sitting car , but now i don't get car sick all , because im doing something else . this game made me good , quick math my school . it really helped . this game definitely good all ages even my dad plays it !	1
anyone who fan black isle games based infinity engine should enjoy this game . they changed up character creation little , so you seemingly more control over your character strengths weaknesses . while iwdii doesn't depth torment or npc interaction baldur gate series , it still good story nice interface . graphically it subpar nwn series , but i think might actually benefit , i found 3d aspect nwn hinderence times . some tips those interested : 1 . make party 4 characters . they level up faster less hang ups ai . 6 members , i found i needed start over import them into new game after prologue because they under powered , 2 them always end up wandering off me . those problems abated only 4 characters . 2 . multiclassing key . thief abilities nice , but you don't really need more than 3 or 4 levels rogue . sink all points into picking locks , traps . multiclass into ranger or mage . you won't worry armor hindering thief skills . adding few levels fighter cleric or barbarian helps learn more weapon skills , case cleric , boost hp . these just few ideas ... 3 . warriors , focus only couple differnt weapons . make sure you least one them blunt weapons , some foes aren't vulnerable bladed variety . also , least 2 members competent ranged weapons	1

when i started playing this game it hard me stop i play it every chance i get best thing it i got it far less money amazon.com	1
i've this game since day it came out some cutscenes my opinion better than lot games out today . this games unique gameplay i think adds its satisfactory . i love everything this game example : music : this games music unreal compared practically every other ps1 game out there . if you take time listen it your not one those gamers like i used before i actually listened any games music , than u not disappointed . gameplay : i absolutely love this games gameplay because its unique style . even though u cant really tell how much you leveled up , you still get idea when it gives u new star so you learn new moves more slots more space new put more skills . charater attack system : there 40 characters this game which i think all promote there own indivituality others . some them may same same type sometimes same basic idea move , but each character uniqely different looking than others , lot them use different weapons , armor . but one i like most all way your special moves each character get cooler looking much stronger you gain stars or levels . some people say getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes make this games battle system easy . i dont think all because types people advantages over others so u know . but even if you , enemies heal more than you , some enemies you run because their so hard . so i dont think its simple . challenge level : i think overall this game very challenging because battle system because there countless # puzzles figure out game definetly add games difficulty . i also think games length adds its challenge meter , because there so many different paths you take game change story line , so you get different characters . so if you dont get some first time you play , you start game same data everything game before . so i think this game game you can't beat so easily one day . i would recommend this game anyone whos looking inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one best games ever created date .	-1

war erupted humans alien life force known gnosis . man danger if nothing soon . that where shion uzuki , designer anti-gnosis weapons system known kos-mos , comes . this game splendid opening , it really gets you thinking life itself ( subtitle also book written philospher ) . anyway , you start out space ship creating ultimate weapon against gnosis . however , before completion gnosis attack your ship kos-mos starts herself up herself . then , your basically thrown around different areas , exploring multiple storylines trying figure out why everything happening . graphics this game similar anime game . characters big googly eyes look little cartoonish ( especially shion ) . that what really sets mood game , though . battle system really unique unlike any i tried . basically you physical or ether ( like magic ) attacks . if you choose guard during turn ap gauge go up , allowing you extra , more powerful combo . once you level up lot , you'll gain more these powerful end moves allow you defeat stronger enemies . you're not limited just characters , you also agws units , which basically mechs . i really not disappointed this game , i loved it better than any rpg ( yes , even ffvii ) . this great game ps2 collection , i would highly recommend it	1

this good collection . it even better if you ps1 emulator fast pc . this would cut down lag . ( course , if you such , other options arise . ) some mentioned lag issue . one who played through these snes , i assure you there horrid lag . ps2 faster cd drive some form caching ps1 titles which helps dramatically , but no means removes delay . chrono trigger console , fights started no discernable lag . creatures background jump out you you're fighting no visible delay beyond jumping animation . ( or whatever they ) ff2/4 screen fade black , then faded , but this took eighth quarter second . ( estimated)chrono trigger great game . story fun , characters great . story non-linear you get great feeling control . how many games give you choice killing off one bosses or accepting their help ? ( your choice affects ending reasonable fashion)ff2 ( 4 ) also great story . when i played through it first , i commented how it felt like playing through book . much less choice progression than even earlier ff , though . fun , regardless . finally , he sound quality lower ps version than original console . fade effects music such gone . i haven't played through sufficiently notice any other changes , but one rather glaring . i really liked use fadeing make it sound like you getting away source . ( such millineal fair music fading one wanders away town . ) ps version rather ungraciously terminates some distance , then some further distance fires up new music . jarring . original chrono trigger would get 5/5 , but these issues particularly hinder it .	-1
introduction:i've this intercooler since it released last spring , it worked well its job . my 360 least 3 days time without game running . here latest update ign regarding intercooler :[ ... ] . here some facts : 1 . scorch marks ? this device hassle make sure it properly securely plugged all way . if you move your 360 lot , cable losen very easily . " snap " power cord holds power cord , but it doesn't make sure it plugged straight or not slight angle . you try this out yourself : move your power cable around , you see if you habit moving 360 around not recheck connect back , it moved slightly angle . what would this ? it would most certainly cause major power issues . you know how end powercord looks like ; all holes pins other end need connect , you can't afford not constantly make sure your cord connecting intercooler nice , tight , secure . 2 . loud noise ? i lot old pcs house , if i ever turn them off , turning them back would cause temporary loud noise coming fan . this due dust ball bearings either wearing out or starting up dust way . this problem ? no , because my intercooler currently starts up louder than usual noise , but like my pc fans , noise stops within seconds minute everything back normal . 3 . how loud intercooler when it brand new ? i don't even notice it . my xbox1 makes more noise than xbox360 + intercooler . moreover , when you're playing game volume , you forget you even intercooler running . 4 . stealing power 360 ? this rediculous . what you think controllers usb devices doing when you plug them into 360 ? supplying power ? yeah right . these tiny fans use less power than plugging your ipod or whatever usb device controllers . it true microsoft not publicly recommended this product , but neither would microsoft allow product would damage their expensive consoles . it microsoft who pay repairs , shipping , replacement these consoles . microsoft would not allow third party develop hardware would break 360 100% time . 5 . what this 100% time thing i just typed ? i know fact there lots faulty intercoolers . i've read lots exchanges intercoolers , actually , my first intercooler never worked . it never turned . i took it back same day everything fine since . if you problem it , don't wait or let your intercooler continue run . just take it back get new one . it onmly 20 bux , thing made plastic , what you expect ? it , however , its job . i never my 360 lockup , overheat , or any kind problems . i xbox second wave/shipment december , it all time ! recommendations : please , don't your 360 standing up . just dumbest thing microsoft could suggested . take look your 360 tell me where largest majority vents ? exactly , they bottomside where you would stand your 360 up . nyko works better if those vents not blocked . it extracting air , thus need more air pass through . even if you don't use intercooler , please , don't stand thing up . i've read more problems overheating disc scratching due verticle 360 . how it scratch discs ? think it , when it released drive , how disc stand straight up ? it just released it drops down slot holds disc , it doesn't hold it perfectly level or straight up position would allow overly sensitive drive pick disc back up right angle .	1
i emphasize strategy . what you not find fancy graphics , studio sound , arcade action , cheats , or killer strategy win every time . this game wonderfully balanced 17 nations ( works ) , 1100 units , 400 spells , 400 magic sites , 250 magic items , much more . but neat thing they give you what you need play your style . berserker , defensive , researcher , swarmer , sneak , diplomatic , whatever . instead feeling like you learning strategies developer mind you learn , you actually develop your own tactics surprises . there people who played it over year still come up new things try . ( yes , its one those games which actually survive your machine year	1

this my first experience sim city . i've never played earlier versions . important note : computer prompts you type code white box lower left part back cd case . well , i looked looked , it wasn't where prompt said it would . after five minutes thinking my eyes playing tricks me , i finally found code . it back owners manual located inside cd case . you'll find it very top back cover manual , not lower left corner . tutorials helpful , so if you're new all this i highly recommend you go through those first . if you feel you need go through them again , you reset tutorials start fresh all over . i'll built small city , i've only this game day , but i know i'm going love it .	1
ahh , tekken series . probably most influential series 3d fighting games outside virtua fighter games . tekken 5 welcome return form this true master genre . 4th game just distance memory , this takes series forward ( or back , depending how you look things ) . tekken 5 uses tried trusted tekken gameplay , while still making everything feel fresh . characters , once before just mere clones certain main ones , now fully fleshed out - moves their own . anna williams example , now not clone her sister nina . when people mention tekken , they usually think people who mastered every single command move , while spending hours upon hours practising hone their ' mad skillz ' - it . making game unplayable beginners genre . this , i think , far truth . tekken 5 welcomes new veterans series alike . whereas button-bashing pretenders tekken crown , coughdeadoralivecough , leave you feeling somewhat cold . tekken other hand leaves you feeling great sense satisfaction when you play . yes , tekken 5 its button-bashing characters - but every single character unique ... how unique they look ! arguably best looking ps2 game date . gorgeous backdrops , fluid , realistic animation textures would look home any next-gen console . music wise , it back form mix techno/dance we've come know love tekken . least we say tekken 4 music better ! you've got your usual story mode run through each character . see why they've entered tournament , etc . but this 5th edition borrows human ai mode virtua fighter 4 . this replaced arcade mode name , pits you against humans who uploaded/downloaded their data tekken arcade machine all over world . it welcome challenge , even though it doesn't even compare facing real-life human opponent . all-in-all , this true homecoming master . easily best tekken date , probably best 3d fighter existence . though i am partial abit soul calibur ... heh	1
one feature hasn't mentioned much cable shielding - you turn volume up all way your tv , you won't hear any extra noise emf . also , make sure you check your xbox settings once you've plugged this ; once you connect high-def adapter , you new options under display settings choosing hd capabilites . make sure you least give yourself option 480p 720p , otherwise there isn't much difference	1
this game tons fun ! my husband , children ( ages 6 7 ) i hours hours enjoyment this game . i definetely recommend your children able read fluently thoroughly enjoy game . this game also great informal parties , ice breaker .	1
game when you first buy it awsome . i mean who wouldent want throw cars helicopters , make people fly 20 yards your finger , bunt-kick police car down 5 blocks ? game lasts bit because " smash smash get some cash " gameplay ( more smash points you get , more moves you get ) . moves best part . one point game , you get move lets you grab onto helicopter or big boss . i always loved riding helicopter 5th street ... its alot better then skateboarding bus if you ask me . anyway , once you get all moves beat story mode get canadian boxers , it gets extremely repetitive.at end game , when you get critical alert status , same guys always come . 5/5 stars first 3 weeks-2 months ... 4 next month , basically declining 3but , whenever you board nothin , no good tv , all your friends offline every other game getting booring , its nice take good ol trip back this game smash mech or .. you know , old times sake	1
i love good , intricate storyline game much next person . rpg , known it generally intricate plotline , one my favorite genres . incredible hulk ultimate destruction credit , it contain story penned seasoned comicbook author . again game credit , story really isn't too bad ( fairly generic , but servicable ) . script voiced adequatly , presented way doesn't deter real focus game : rampant , wanton , gratuitous destruction some most creative ways possible . i love hulk character . i even liked ang lee flick ( no hate mail please-myfriends give me enough crap one it ) . there something cathartic nearly indestructable creature operates pure id . who doesn't want just lose it when we get pushed too far ? this game many things going it : it controls very well , nearly every object vast varied environments destructable some way shape or form , graphics certainly servicable ( although not top-notch ) . best way describe this take open gamespace like grand theft auto games , minus infuriatingly difficult missions , add set missions beg you destroy everything . every mission based some way premise you giant green demolition expert . now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly , but game remain fresh large part huge selection upgraded moves you ' buy ' smashpoints , which awarded via smashing things ( deep huh ? ) . it really massive orgy soothing mayhem , mercy it ever satisfying ! if you tried out first hulk game , please aware this nothing like . there no more tedious sneaking missions bruce banner . you hulk , jade giant absolute gas this title . like gta games , you not forced into playing missions ( although this unlock new moves arenas play ) . you take side quests which not only pretty creative , but downright hilarious others ( try ' batter up!' example latter ) . if first hulk game ang lee movie left sour taste your mouth when it comes mr. green genes , then give this one shot . my opinion , they got essence hulk down pat , show him fun character he . later !	1
intro . jak 3 ending jak daxter trilogy , i say it pulled it off quite nicely . there few flaws game , but nothing major . you start out jak , now exile haven city because people who distrust him his dark powers . he taken people wasteland story continues there . gameplayonce again , jak moves very fluidly nicely exact same controls last game ( except certain new powers like light jak ) . , once again , animators wonderful job making lush , detailed landscape characters . sunsets sunrises well , nothing looks cut pasted walls , like spyro-era games . i like way this game you get move haven city wasteland . this way you get even more terrain explore than last game . additionally , you get control light jak powers ! i thought this nice twist nice way add something new people who enjoyed dark jak option . one thing personally irks me ... they took away keira voice actor ! she barely speaks when she , it not same person . least other keira role ! also , ending felt little dragged out towards end game , i just hoping it would finish soon instead prolonging it more crammed-in missions . pros conspros : 1 . nice characters2 . no glitches so far3 . no loading times4 . detailed landscape5 . new powers old : dark jak light jak6 . good switches areascons : 1 . blasting people or monsters over over get annoying . 2 . ending seemed go pace snail . overalla nice finish series ! if you bought first two , you'll most definitely drawn this one anyway . :	1
i'll admit able go around stormtrooper kill everything sight fun . wicked fun . this game delivers if you want good time playing fps involving star wars . major drawback game targetting . it like using sniper rifle halo 1 but reticle size one assault rifle . you turn auto-aim option help accuracy but then reticle tends follow enemy screen it more difficult shoot over ally shoulder . drawback you can't jump/fall shoot same time like other fpss . plus , fighters hard learn how use other vehicles . you still fine footsoldier but it would nice if vehicles little easier use	1

i wanted this workout " game " get back into shape after baby . it great workout including cardio , combat , isolation abs , arms or legs , mind body including yoga tai chi-type exercises . i love it tells you what day work out ( if you don't you fail day ! ) it increases intensity workouts based your previous performance . there several different workouts each segment so each workout truely unique help prevent burnout . your workouts assigned letter grade based your performance so it motivates me get allusive " " , which hard achieve ( it should ! ) . i am week 8 12 week program i definintely feel my muscles more toned firm after not working out year . i love nike helped produce game . i recommend this game anyone ; however , i issues eyetoy camera . you would think i would get how camera works after 8 weeks but i still problems . sometimes it indicates i touched something i nowhere near , sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries it register i touched something . you're still getting workout , but i'm working towards getting good letter grade . i want credit what i'm doing right . combat exercises frustrating i hard time believing i'm not punching hard enough often receive 0 score . i've started working out night sunlight windows makes camera less responsive . there couple times i've walked left screen my body triggered " try again " button after cardio workout ... so i 10 minute workout again history shown when i try exit out it , game fails me day quitting . all all i'm happy workouts , but just know camera takes some getting used . i hope others better luck it than i . my husband 12 week program also he lost 10 pounds i've lost 9	-1
i bought this game not video game but so i could my own personal trainer without paying gym membership . i am two weeks into my 12 week routine i love it . software very well it really " real time feedback . " if i'm leaning forward when i'm not suppose while doing exercise trainer say " try standing up straight . " i am definitely getting great work out . 10 more weeks i'll let you know if it any good or not . so far it seems helping . i love it builds itself so week 12 you doing more routines more intense . one drawback camera really sensitive - i make my kids leave room because if they walk around background it picks up their movements lowers my score . if you hate gym but always wanted your own personal trainer " kinetic " seems way go	1

there so much see discover this game . it took me over 70 hours just complete walkthrough i am still working capturing all monsters monster arena . someone who wanted complete all side quests , find all special items , etc . could easily spend more than 100 hours this game never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay . graphics also outstanding , among best i seen video game . it took me awhile get used sphere grid used increase your characters ' stats . first i didn't find it satisfying typical method " leveling up " . but eventually i began enjoy it it now one my favorite aspects game . only thing i found tiresome how long cutscenes . storyline itself quite good . but i wish it told shorter cutscenes or least gave players option skip through cutscenes . still this minor complaint otherwise excellent game . definitely worth buying !	1
i luv this game it so much fuuuuuuuuuun !!!! i hate you ppl who say it stupid i think you stupid buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
i've never taken time write review before , but all negative comments made me feel obligated defend this game . number negative reviews point out many aspects game far simpler railroads compared rrt3 , which absolutely correct . if you seeking complex simulation , railroads not game you . if , however , you wanting fun easy grasp game trains , then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads . it one my favorite games all time	1

after finishing both " half life episode i " " chronicles riddick : escape butcher bay " over few days , i looking fun first person shooter game would let me pass away hour or so day , allow me unwind slaughtering constant flow enemies high powered weapons without resulting actual murder innocent people . i'd heard " far cry " pretty good , so i bought it , installed it got ready blas t.t he first thing i noticed astonishing graphics engine . it without doubt most beautiful environment ever created fps . my jaw floor first few hours , checking out ridiculously high detailed environment . outdoor scenery looks like paradise holiday destination crystal clear blue water lush green jungle . there birdlife , fish general feeling you're running around living , breathing world . one thing very different right start would play major role later missions . there no save game option ! there checkpoints littered around levels , but it occasionally around 10 20 minutes solid game-play them . first this just annoyed me since i found myself reloading over over some harder missions . i couldn't just run into fray , firing my weapon left , right centre anything moves because one headshot would send me back heck long way some instances . i forced change my style play all out assault , stealthy , crawling , breath-holding , sweating , nerve wracking approach . i rediscovered part myself loved " thief : dark project " so very much all those years ago . yet i still got combine approach levels general carnage when it simply unavoidable . i am now firm believer save game option should removed many other ( not all ) first person games out there it raises intensity level dramatically . story itself fairly average dialogue even more so , which really what places " far cry " below likes " half life " . you basically just following instructions entire game , used violent killing machine no real choices . but some reason , i just didn't care i so absorbed surroundings simply surviving it didn't lower my enjoyment . enemies very good ai , flanking me whenever possible generally actually trying avoid shot rather than running straight me . there plenty occasions though where enemy just stand there distance while you shoot them plain sight , but generally all good . weapons fantastic both highly effective satisfying use . sniper rifle always personal favourite this game makes awesome use it , massive maps open ground . while initially i prepared standard " serious sam " type game , " far cry " turned out so much more . some fantastic graphics , inspired level design , forced variations play some fiercely intense gunfights make this game absolute winner . you add value money well since there 20 long missions get through . no save option , those 20 take you long time complete . but you love it ! i sure	1
title doesn't imply anything negative , i just really liked morrowind exotic cities cultural clashes . this game makes you move your virtual life morrowind imperial province which more similar earthly historical place . now sentimental stuff out way good stuff . graphics much , much better than morrowind . my system isn't over recommended settings but i still play smoothly choosing my settings correctly it looks very good . models much more detailed effect you'll sometimes even gasp when you run into attractive female who got her clothes stolen . sound just good morrowind main theme tribute morrowind main theme . there lot voices this game it possible not read any conversions just listen npcs . you thankfully skip over lines you don't want hear if you fast reader . just like morrowind you also add new songs music folder if you want use custom soundtrack . control improved . blocking so much better even if you aren't warrior you hold your own melee against common enemies . new magic casting take some getting used so unified menus . controls feel more like console game oblivion battles lot more action based than morrowind . gameplay , most changes better . cities improved seemingly using gothic 2 like model . it seems me they also took hunting " radiant ai " playing game . it fits tes very nicely . enemies level up now so leveling up wrong skills may get you into trouble higher levels but so far it hasn't bothered me . trading different i'm not sure it improved much . lockpicking gives you option minigame but you also it morrowind way . speechcraft thankfully much more improved . stealing also more elaborate . steal store hang around guards come looking you even if nobody actually saw you stealing . missions now more elaborate even most trivial ones may surprise you some funny , emotional even sensual topics . travel different no more stilt riders , boats or guild guides . now you horse option ( they actually fight too ! ) fast travel option places you've before or major sites you haven't yet . but end this still tes . all you're old morrowind tricks like repairing bound armor , shooting arrows while levitating , beating people pulp your bare hands gaining magicka fighting your own creatures still possible . personal note i'm glad atronach birthsign now gives you 50% spell absortion stunted magicka . if you liked morrowind you'll most likely like this one well . players who put off morrowind low level combat should try oblivion . players who traditionally don ' like deep rpgs should give it chance . like hack slash games ? create stereotypical warrior join fighters guild . like stealth games ? create stereotypical thief join thieves guild . you may just like it enough try out new things	1

disgaea 2 fun , cartoony combination rpg tactical game . you adell , young fighter , who pairs up rozalin order defeat evil zenon . you build up party characters , including fighters , healers , pretty much any monster type you defeat battle . you wander through lands , you often find monsters conquer . during these battles , you end up grid . each character move certain distance per turn , get around behind your enemy . some ways game like typical rpg . there evil main boss conquer . there various smaller enemies way . there power-ups collect weapons buy . graphics not meant realistic or cutting edge . they casual , cute , fun . disgaea really shines its humor . it not meant really little - its characters joke looking up girls ' skirts there swears such " kick their ass " . still , game generally very family friendly ton fun it . most villagers turned into demons quite wild personality changes . main character - adell - still human . when you go around talking other people , one muses why adell still human . " it because he main character " ? rozalin , zenon daughter , very spoiled , stuck-up teen girl her dialogue quite funny . many flaws other games taken care here . when you go into shops , they new items each time , giving you selection choose you find interesting . you customize new characters , creating party just perfect your gaming style . voices cutesy traditional anime style , sounds fit well world . plot fairly involved really draws you . again , this isn't dark , serious story angst power . it fun , light-hearted romp through fun fantasy world , where you play few hours , save , pick up story next time you free time . well recommended	-1
final fantasy vii : dirge cerberus said last spin off ( aside psp crisis core ) , one goes furthest into future vii world . game seems like must-play final fantasy vii vincent valentine fans alike , it . thinking , most those fans probably play mostly rpgs , this game relatively easier than popular fps ( shooters ) like halo . rpg-fan , yet still wanting learn story game , i very happy easy difficulty ( though it bumped up something more difficult there plenty extras difficult get outside story mode . ) controls little bad , but nothing someone can't get used . one square second or third shooter games , this one pretty good . i'd recommend if you're doing what i playing it story , then get official guide so you get all hidden capsules you go ( which unlocks cutscenes once you retrieve them , you never get them again ) . guide actually pretty good this game , well soundtrack . if you're fan final fantasy music , definitely pick soundtrack up . lastly , if you're final fantasy fan or rpg fan , get this game everything related it . it worth it . i couldn't put this game down , even if some characters bit under-developed . if you're shooter fan games like halo you probably disappointed	-1

i picked up wii this game launch day after much research . let me just say i own nes ( i got used ) , n64 , dreamcast , gc , now wii . i getting tired gaming . i am definitely not hardcore gamer , my precious free hours when i come home work i don't want sit around get fat ( that what tv ) . anyway , this game really gets you moving . mini games often hilarious ( you randomly lol while playing ) fun . shooting levels end each set mini games utilize wii controller most natural way , it immersive intuitive . i played this game 33% completion first day i it . this unusual me . i figure i'll get ten hours gameplay out story mode if things continue present pace . game gives you objective early , this motivates you progress through mini games . i like them so much i gone back beaten optional 4th mini game each level i've passed . i can't speak any other launch titles , but i haven't this much fun single player gaming console ... ever . all mini games shooting games ( you shoot plungers way ) available multiplayer after they beaten , although some them cannot played concurrently multiple players . final note , some mini games physically wear you out . some games involving rapid movement ( running , cow milking , cow tossing , carrot juice pumping ) may require you catch your breath . if you can't handle this , then you'll glad know you skip one mini games each level . but this physical exertion makes beating mini game much more gratifying . i cannot recommend this strongly enough . get this game	1
half-life made its debut 1998 , it shocked entire world . half-life time featured stunning graphics , gameplay , sound . it simply one those games every gamers hands , still this date half-life game every action-game developing company carefully needs study order their games success . shortly after release once gasp world ended , two game developers joined together create game not gasped world again , but made it scream . game pits terrorists counter-terrorists fast-paced sort " s.w.a.t.

fable easily one greatest games ever released . story boy who grows up become hero still wants revenge tragedy his past , it compelling very entertaining . gameplay excellent , it not your typical rpg since this plays like action/adventure game . i love how you choose good or bad choices you make reflect what your character looks like . game also plays like real life . you get married , divorced , sex buy houses , even decorate them ! game so real you choose straight , gay or bi-sexual depending who you sleep . only thing missing you can't children , but should change future installments . cool thing game more evil you get , more people afraid you . but , more hero savior you become , you greeted praise clapping every town you go . overall , this game must !!! replay value extremely high . i played beat game many times i'm still not tired it ! if you love rpgs or hate rpgs this still fantastic . i can't wait until fable 2 released , which currently completed . get this , it simply amazing !	1

i purchased this two pack memory card they pretty good no problems memory card	1
my 9 year old daughter loves ps2 , so buying cards worth cost	1
ps2 far dead !! square-enix it again !!!! first off , i am going say i love this game !!! i'm big turn-based/stategy rpg fan . but i would say this gamefs battle system semi-real-time strategy elements i love it !! i would compare battle system likes parasite eve vagrant story !! same elements still present original valkyrie profile . this probably best rpg i played all year . i strongly recommend this game any rpg fan definitely satisfy until ffxii !!! now review : graphics : 5 out 0f 5 simply amazing i knew old ps2 still it her . this game some best graphics you going see ps2 , you may see some pixilation but hardly noticeable unless you looking it ... detail characters , background dungeons amazing . i really get taken back vagrant story when i play this game . omg special attacks look absolutely gorgeous !! perform special attack your jaw drop . i canft say anything negative graphics this game what so ever especially last generation . sound : 4.5 out 5 game sounds great !!! voice over well !! battle cries wonderful take you back original valkyrie profile unless course you purchased it psp then it wont take you back very farclol controls 5 out 5 okay i donft thing i played rpg better controls . you play 2d screen side scrolling outward inward exits entrances press up or down accordingly access them . anyone who played first one knows exactly how it works . first new thing you notice new battle control scheme . old you still press , o , , or correspond character you assigned button , still works great !! new now you able roam 3d once you battle mode this works great i explain gameplay section . l2 lets you find switch targets , then you just analog get there . gameplay 5 out 5 dare i say umm perfect !?!?!? first i address two things i loved original valkyrie profile you find this sequel/prequel ! 1st thing - i began get really annoyed rpgfs now days make you talk nearly every single person town move story . this never worry valkyrie profile series . you go town if there something importance there cg or ai takes over all you listen/read then go shopping or if you really want , talk limited amount people town , but it normally just random talk nothing real importance story . or you may talk some people fnd side quest maybe ? many rpgfs i tried play lately suffered thisci mean who time sit play game hours only left feeling like you barely accomplished anything , cause you couldnft find right person move story ? 2nd thing battle system , able press certain button numerous times watch character spring action always joy . lets you feel more involved battle instead just letting you sitting watching . new additions great additionscfirst free roaming battle . you move anywhere 3d battle screen you want within parameters course . since you able move anywhere battle screen square-enix thought it would good idea allow you split up your party , they right !! basically you party 4 ; but you split them up into 2 teams . imagine this if you willcyou send one team either fight separate group enemies or you send one group draw attention use other group attack behind taking enemy surprise normally causing more damage . strategy added !!! other notable mentions : special attacks stellar , enemy bosses huge , characters very likable . also while dungeon you still turn foes crystal use them aide you reaching different areas , but dig this !! now you turn foe crystal then shoot foe second time transport yourself its position . ex . you see enemy ledge front/above you but you cannot reach him or ledge simply jumping . so you shoot diagonally him freeze him shoot second time you immediately transported his position ledge he transported your old position . how cool ? story ( so far ) 4 out 5 , story so far great what i tell takes place before original valkyrie profile , i am only 40% it but so far i am really drawn it , i cant go more detail sake spoiling it , but it intriguing . bottom line : if you rpg fan you must this title your library games , it not disappoint . combination great original gameplay , stellar graphics , intriguing story , innovative new features this one not missed . even if you not rpg fan i would still recommend this rental .	1
i liked this game . i mean final fantasy vii still god final fantasy game but this ok	1
i thoroughly enjoyed playing final fantasy viii . introductory movie i hooked . world story very unique , well new battle system . i thought junction system fairly easy understand once i got used it , i loved it more than materia system vii . characters viii all very likeable . it interesting play game perspective student named squall , who happens one my favorite heroes final fantasy series . cinematics game very nicely produced captured best moments . start finish , i fun playing this game highly recommend it fans final fantasy series role playing games general .	1
just great . all around nice work microsoft , their newly launched marketplace really put push other manufacturers . xbox live really great gaming experience	1
our whole family plays this game ! we fell love first katamari game , but it frustrating trying complete each subsequently harder level . this game isn't like . each level different its own right . some levels require you roll faster , some bigger , some them you gather many certain item you find . it challenging without frustration . you always go back try better each level , find cousin or present hidden ... or you continue . there two player mode also . it much more fun than first katamari . course if you don't know premise first game you might not understand king common peoples ' rantings ... but it simple enough . roll around get big your sticky ball . it addictive	1
this praise game , rolled into other praises . now , you've read synopsis others : your character prince ( or one his cousins ) rolls orb ( i.e. katamari ) , which collects every object level . this game works many levels , it first foremost absurd bewildering . introductory animations cut scenes off-the-wall yet amusing . incessant rolling cathartic addictive , bonuses involve finding hidden presents cousins level . there many variations rolling theme game ( roll sumo wrestler into food , roll snowball onto snowman , roll fireflies into kid reading light , time trials , etc ) , but most satisfying original premise rolling everything anything into large ball possible . once you start consume people , trucks , skyscrapers , ships , clouds , etc , then you feel very powerful . music very catchy , something vacant many video games . my only criticism : cooperative two player mode venture into frustration quite easily . my wife i played , who both good game , but you often find yourself awkwardly slowing moving where you want . that part problem , where you want roll may not where other person wants roll ... so communicate well	1
this fun game if your inti mechs graphics good but like first halo game type difficulty level weak easy kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs then varients those ones just differnet weapons loadout multiplayer good but not great	1
doom 3 scary . you literally spend most game dark nightmarish creatures come out nowhere try kill you . environments look great so character models . game long but longer if you get lost . however , this game few flaws . one ( it big one ) you always carry flashlight around . because most fps only character one weapon one hand time other hand non-existent , you constently switch flashlight weapon . so when it dark you fight , you either hold flashlight keep whacking your opponent until it dead or stay dark shoot your enemy which you hard time finding it . second con ( unlike half life 2 ) you can't really interact much . you can't grab certain objects drop them or throw them . final con , which comes one word : imps . these most annoying enemy game . you constently fight them it get annoying sometimes . otherwise , game get	1
let me start off saying ditto previous comments compdude off track . keys there . i found all four these games great . i haven't gotten into lotr one yet because it graphics-intensive , i laptop . other three games cool too . price , it great deal ( compare buying titles individually )	1
i only played this game what 20 minutes first 5 fell love w/the game . i liked stage where you get great wall china(i think thats what it ) . my dad played this 4 minutes gave wii 8/10 ! he said it could go up if he played more . controls so easy fun !!! i highly recommend this any wii gamer or person who getting wii	1
first off , this game graphics not mind-blowing . they very good , but they not beautiful xbox 360 or playstation 3 . said , not reason you buy this game . game amazing replayability because it amazing controls fun factor . you turn wii remote its side use it steering wheel . when massive jump , use " steering wheel " change your pitch land safely . perfect landings met speed boosts . playing this game friends blast . your friends wowed controls then wowed fun they're . i played several wii games already this my favorite ! must buy	1
i just received this game yesterday i've already put few hours worth time into it . you can't help but notice rockstar trademark graphics intro . although controls character movements i think improved over san andreas controls movement . i found it challenging balance time this game . clock moves pretty fast , you run around finding challenges well watching clock make sure you aren't truant class or trespassing night when you're supposed bed ! you also really watch out prefects , which way , same term used harry potter . maybe it british thing ? i disagree one reviewer saying jimmy not bully . he isn't like other bullies , but he win respect others ( gta style ) protecting beating up bullies . so basically jimmy bullies bullies . breaking into lockers , running errands underpriveleged , flirting girls , getting good grades class , riding around skateboard , one my favorites dodgeball gym class ! these all things i've come across first few hours play ! what next ? get this game ! it vast array ecleptic gaming skills entertainment styles , you won't regret it ! if you also looking completely original game , graphics like i've never seen before i noticed alot bully buyers get okami , which i also , like no other game graphics-wise . very artistic those who girlfriends get tired watching you play same ol . it pleasing eye . very artistic original .	-1
i finally got ds one first " older " games i tried hunt down this wonderful system phoenix wright . i've " jonesing " this game awhile now . it unique entertaining . choices court sections kind linear but it too much fun not " love " this title . this type game makes ds so unique proud say " i own this system " . more games should take note follow it footsteps . this must buy any ds library . other titles this type catagory must buys : trauma center trace memory . this system made these types games . these games why i always trust nintendo high quality interesting games . game !	1
hilarity , adventure , wit fun this game nothing shy stupendous ( amazing great , marvelous ) . it certain nostaglia it new twist adventure/puzzle genre . think all games consumed our time back day such king quest , police quest , leisure suit larry put it tune trials , evidence investigation hints rpg , text adventure anime you'll land phoenix wright . it concept seem retro but it really like nothing you played before . star this show phoenix wright , lawyer who new scene must prove worth fey co law offices . his first case , you must take murder case defendant lawyer . court , you prove court defendant ' not quilty ' cross-examining witness testimonies . your object find faults contradictions their testimony referencing evidence prior statements . you ' press ' them everything they say make them open up more their testimony or get them confess more information . game doesn't stop there though , after winning your first case you go also investigate crime scenes , talk witnesses find your own evidence your next case . think law order but you handling both sides coin . sure , there detective but he bit slow witted quick come mis-conclusions . where you come , further investigate all missing gaps detective doesn't fill , use finding investigation prove your defendant innocent later court provide court clarity what actually happened . it plays like puzzle/adventure you must find clues evidence present them correct times ( object testimony , prove contradiction or trigger event investigation ) order progress through game . these items stored your court record . this game plays more like interactive comic book definitely not bad thing . most your time spent reading text , i would say this takes up 75% game . this doesn't hurt game score any because 1 ) game great story intriguing around every corner 2 ) interaction characters oft times funny not all dry . it reads like quality script written comic book or tv show . following 25% interaction , ability choose right option or present evidence right moment game . this interaction goes seamless story fits appropriately ds . stylus greatly utilized presenting evidence out your court record exploring crime scenes . there good reason why this makes most people top ten ds list . graphics : 3.5 out 5 . although this game only consist anime-esque stylings still life characters only slightly animated amongst static backgrounds , graphics still help carry story . it looks like makings slightly animated , interactive comic book . character art well drawn each character changes looped animations based their current mood . however , graphics could easily shown lesser system such gba . perhaps graphics revamped enhanced slightly ds version . only real thing separates it gba title its use stylus its length . sound : 4 out 5 , good use sound effects use music add suspense drama game . gameplay : 5 . story : 5 . replay value : 3 . overall : 4.5 must ds owners	1

far football games go over last 3 or 4 years ncaa football best . this year so far no different . i got madden haven't even started season yet because it comes out so early none rosters anywhere near close . i play cowboys create 8 players . also gameplay madden so unrealistic linebacker intercept everything . me since 2003 ncaa looked better played much better than madden . players madden look so little some reason . you control your players alot easier ncaa . trick momentum meter this game try get good lead early after it alot easier . one thing i dont like this game past 2 years they taken off special intro add all other junk . see i play miami they always run thru smoke beginning but they took it out 2 years ago , why ? also they used show notre dame walk down their stairs but they took off too . also last 2 years i havent won heisman even though i better stats . other than game solid , haven't played superstar mode yet . football fans this game worth buy	1

my television completely different part my house my high speed internet connection , so while i wasn't thrilled dish out extra money this adapter , i say it completely worth it . since i figured out how set up my home wireless network coordinate 360 , i get very strong connection no problems staying connected . only issue i when i first set up adapter i didn't known enough wireless networks everything clicking together . first 360 would access xbox live , but using other nearby wireless networks because i not give 360 password id access my linksys router . i live center city philadelphia , default adapter picking up using whatever open wireless networks available . range must good , because it would register six or seven other networks varying strengths . once i figured out my linksys router password code ( i think it wep number ) i able punch router id into 360 360 then automatically connected secure wireless router my home . i never single issue since . i don't think this delay optimal setup anyone fault but my own , since i pretty ignorant how wireless networks set up but i feeling it may happen others . all all , i think secure wireless network home what become standard next few years . this adapter works great , small disappears behind console , reduces clutter wires , allows you keep your computer high speed connection separate distinct your television area . it definitely worthy purchase	1
well , i must say after purchasing linksys wga11b wireless-b game adapter while yes this adapter overpriced , it work considering i only got linksys adapter work once then it shut down middle update i must say price looked worth it . i can't vouch your financial situations but after speading nearly 3 days trying set up linksys when my wife finally said i should get this instead - this hooked up connected instantly . no problems i guess price it look nice hooked back xbox . so you may not many problems i linksys but if you any questions or limited computer/networking ability this " worth " price ( only because nothing simplier exist ) . so i would recommend this product if you want true plug-and-play which i don't believe linksys . i'm sure plently people happy linksys , it just didn't work me . so think first avoid paying both . i would go back never buy linksys if i could	-1
i've playing mario games since original debut nes am extremely happy my purchase this game . rpg style great offshoot mario franchise . dialogue , animations , surprises hilarious , 30+ hours i spent playing game well worth it . there large amount replayability there tons badges shine sprites find . i agree previous review frustration not able skip cut scenes . most it pain tab through tons dialogue , which grow tiresome if you get stuck certain point consistently watch same section over over	1

while ps2 version not really bad , it horrible next near perfect versions xbox pc . ps2 sound music max payne uneven really scatchy when narrative scenes . gameplay still good , even though some areas cut off ps2 limitations but doesn't hurt gameplay too much . graphics also very scratchy , so characters , even though all versions max payne don't great character models , ps2 version looks even more out order . but controls better ps2 , smaller controller ps2 really helps compared xbox controller keyboard . still highly enjoyable , game still intense action game lot violence . if you can't get your hands any other version , then ps2 perfect you .	1

i haven't tried it light gun yet , but even 2 dual-shocks this unique accessible 2-player o-o game ( one drives , one shoots ) decent replay value . i don't think difficulty increased , but it fun go back beat your old scores play unlocked cars . i suppose it could finished rental , but personally i find it nice own some simple o-o games like this you pop play right away if friend shows up , esp . if friend not hardcore gamer . 1-player game it starts feel like gta-lite after awhile , although kids this one better because it lacks mature content	-1
i really enjoyed this game . yes , it not perfect , but it definitely worth price game . if you're looking escape back old west , then this your game . many reviewers mentioned , there some flaws game - if you get past them , then i am positive you enjoy game . horse riding fun , but i also found myself enjoying plot - it plays like movie . cut scenes great fun watch well ( voice ) acted . graphics detailed well . i found artists took their time modeling weaponry era it likely very historically accurate ( big plus ) . if you ever wanted " star " western , this your chance . if you like tv shows movies such gunsmoke , deadwood , once upon time west you'll probably wonder where this game ... i .	1
xenosaga episode i remains type paragon story character driven rpg . there so much tell game players looking sink their teeth into 40 or so hour cinematic rpg wouldn't need look any further , would also very satisfied . episode ii bit shorter not quite good first installment . however , xenosaga iii good rpg get . i love watch films solid plots memorable , meaningful characters . it pleasure experience video game achieve kind involvement through long period 40+ hours . episode iii , throughout its duration , constantly engrosses player many plot developments , flashbacks , insights into many characters . every primary characater respected deep explorations into their own motives agendas . everything game meticulously crafted . every bit plot dialogue builds upon itself intro all way conculsion , still there room much more pondered . there some very memorable music pieces game which really accecntuate current mood . they really serve bring emotional weight characters life . voice acting great all-around . there never moment when acting sounds forced or laughable . difficulty , most part , quite easy . it only until near end game where some bosses may cause you see game over screen few too many times . i actually spent three days stuck one boss . solution this stay driven continue try different strategies . good thing your characters switched out any time even though battle parties only consist three members , rest your comrades whether they battle or not also receive experience points fighting stay leveled your main battle members . this way , you use them later crucial battles when they needed without take trouble level them . i enjoyed xenosaga iii beginning end . game like this especially treat player who appreciates in-depth , character driven , plot-heavy game . philosophical theological themes explored within it raise many questions human beings world . there characters who fight give their lives ideals . there also individuals who struggle find meaning their own lives what path they should take . role destinty fate strong components game . there always something brewing throughout this adventure . there always something captivates you makes you think twice setting controller down .	-1

someone who enjoyed previous castleavania games going back early nintendo systems , i find this new incarnation somewhat different than 2d games old . but i still liked it lot . basically this game my main preoccupation last 2 weeks or so . i'd rank it one top 5 xbox games i've ever played ( out 50 or so ) terms sheer fun level . primarily i liked fact you gain new items skills , you go back previously explored areas new areas open up . this " expanding universe " aspect makes it similar super metroid games little like some zelda titles gamecube . i also found " combine " system ( seeking out materials create new weapons armor ) very engrossing , i liked various ways obtain those materials - steal monsters , seek out hidden rooms , etc . graphics sound fx well below " all-time great " level games like halo 1 or 2 , but they're perfectly servicable , ranging very good excellent . i thought spooky ambiance various castle hallways , dungeons , etc ., actually captured rather well . although i completely get into process exploring various worlds this game ( especially help some online faq references ! ) , i concede few drawbacks . currency uses fairly limited . there only one shop , things you most want or need cannot bought there . later stages game , you accumulate lot excess cash can't used anything . also , process levelling-up your character his " i.d. " ( innocent devil ) companions definitely got rather repetitive little boring after awhile . those minor drawbacks , however . overall , this great game	1
we rented this game out before we purchased it we really like it . we went see movie our almost 4 year old son loved shark tale , so we thought we'd give xbox game try happy we . its really great game . controls pretty simple our son play game , he needs help game , but overall he enjoys it ! my husband i both like playing this game well . its fun , pretty great graphics , great music background , good game play . its not hard kids , but not easy adults either , so you don't get bored this game . we have'nt played very far into game yet , but so far its big hit our house	-1

my best friend halo lover . when i learned this game i not interested until i read some reviews saw videos what you could game , not mention graphics . quite while my best friend i got into crazy dispute inbetween which game better . i enjoy halo but half-life 2 just overpowers it so much . p.c. i think only thing could beat it half-life 3 once it comes out , what my friend says halo 2 ( only thing beat it halo 3 ) . now , half-life 2 p.c. doesn't take entirely high tech computer , fact you graphic card direct x7 this game p.c. if you own p.c. version i'm sure you told before there no reason buy it xbox , which true . game port p.c. version you probably find nothing new xbox version caompared p.c. version . if you incredibly high p.c. don't waste your money xbox version because p.c. least ati radeon x800 video card , 2.4 ghz processor , 512mb ram , i'm pretty sure run game max , i'm not sure i don't own p.c. versoin . okay , now game itself . this game not multiplayer componant , so if you only game multiplayer side things you won't find any . if you complaining you understand why this game no multiplayer componant end this review . half-life original game released valve , game company , year 1999 went computer game year . six years later , six years valve worked sequel , released it 2004 . game my favorite game all time now . game won nine goty ( game year ) awards 2004 , which included game year ( it beat halo 2 ) , p.c. game year , outstanding innovation computer gaming , outstanding achievemant animation , outstanding achievmant art direction , outstanding character performance - male , outstanding achievmant game play engineering , outstanding achievmant visual engineering , first person action game year . so it won nine goty awards , but it nominated eleven . since half-life 2 such story driven game i begin storyline . if you not played half-life 1 storyline may not make much sense , which makes game even better because you get puzzle your past storyline world you currently . not even i yet understood everything what happened first half-life game i probably never . but give you some sense what happening you play character named gordan freeman who , several years ago transfered over science research facility called black mesa . what i know gordan accidentally unleashed alien races upon earth . i not say anymore ruin storyline because less you know better it , i ruined quite bit storyline myself becuase i found out too much game . now characters . characters game incredibly realistic . i told before valve created into characters faces what they called " muscles " . game characters obviously not real muscles but if you look movement characters jaws , they actually move , escpecially during opening scene . besides complexity characters realistic looking " muscles " characters excellant voices could not anyone else doing their voices better . characters actually more immeresed into game rather than your average f.p.s. areas where there only dialoge , which enjoyable , you might notice if someone talking you they looking directly you . if you go behind them while they talking you , they turn around instead just stand there talking thin air . if there something passing character like friend , their eyes actually follow person walking , which always amazes me . gameplay- probably every review this game you find most likely it largest section gameplay half-life 2 , good reason . there single element truly makes writing gameplay worthwhile : physics . most games you play something known ragdoll physics , this where if you find dead enemy nearby they move around according their enviroment . example , if you walk over dead body game ragdoll physics body most likely start rolling . these physics found games like republic commando , far cry . half-life 2 built unique physics engine made valve called havok physics . havok pysics one best versions physic engines abailable gaming market . every object game different weights , when you strike , shoot , move , or whack those objects they actually feel real look real . explosions made this physics engine so amazing when you shoot explosive barrels you see red shattered pieces fly different directions looking like explosion came inside , which it . you find most physics interactible through one best weapons first person shooters today : gravity gun . this weapon law physics built right into it , pretty much everyting your weapon , i think you could figure it out there . more gameplay would including your fameous hazard suit which provide you shielding if you charge it . suit also allow you breath underwater time , it comes equipped rechargeable flashlight , cool sprint feature which recharges too . gamespy said p.c. review half-life 2 throughout game you introduced new weapons one one , whenever you get new weapon you put situations you need weapon so you learn which enemies you should shoot which weapons , where use weapons , how use them tactically which very good way show you how use weapons this game . there eleven weapons this game which may seem small but gravity gun you not need any more . i not think you could come up any more weapons you would want . . i . - half-life pretty tough a.i. they really know how flank throw grenades . grenades draw you into areas you shot up killed or grenades kill you , so combat pretty intense . you hear combine ( enemies ) talking each other through radios their helmets they plan attack you . overall combine largest example a.i. half-life 2 , other enemies aren't smart because they more animalistic rather than human . sound- every weapon , every voice , every explosion , every splash water , every alarm , every organic noise you hear this game good . water sounds what you find most games just because they all pretty much same . when you hear strange creatures getting shot their legs break or blood splatters them it sounds like it should . gun shots could not wanted any other way , i already mentioned voices . ign video review p.c. version this game says you cannot really say anything bad this game , goes sound too . where next , oh music- game great music , it this strange feeling it , but it fits all i really say . some reviews say this game bad framerate ( gamespot ) , but i say it only occurs when there large amounts physics taking place if you say so so better framerate than half-life 2 i simply ask you , " game havok physics engine ? " if it , okay , half-life 2 still better . i said earlier you find out why there no multiplayer componant half-life 2 available , which true it because it hard enough get such great game half-life 2 xbox alone it complex physics engine . if you want half-life 2 multiplayer apect , i would not blame you , gravity gun , fun . but there game made valve xbox made specifically multiplayer called counter-strike , it modern warfare what i know m-16s alike , but what i heard it incredibly fun , go ahead buy one if you want it same company but just know it not look good becuase counter-strike pretty old game i think . game supposed filled crazy multiplayer combat , but i not played it so i leave it . i saved one largest parts game last : graphics . valve created masterpiece when it comes graphics this game . six years really allowed them go far they could when it comes their graphics , this best looking xbox game out there . compared p.c. graphics ati radeon x800 video card it not look good , xbox there some minor details could not brought up what they should look like , but they details you not paying much attention . if you played game where graphics impressive but still not great , walked up wall you see flaws fakeness graphics . when you walk out good twenty feet wall then look realistic . half-life 2 , flaws still there but you only need ten feet away instead twenty . i wish i could keep going , i probably but i spent least hour typing this review just say this game one best games out there most likely best first person shooter xbox probably always . if you see game words valve front box outlined white lines , expect perfection , unless it counter strike , those games more based multiplayer side things rater than all aspects normal game . my closing statement half-life 2 game sheer perfection , it best xbox single player game available : buy this game ! it worth it .	1

i played all rpgs , baldur gate , nwn , dungeon siege , final fantasy , toee , etc . i say , stumbling upon icewind dale 2 real treat .. sure graphics dated , but wow .. storyline , dialogue , descriptions rooms actions all incredibly well written ( breath fresh air , after playing ds ) . quests don't get way game , like so many others get bogged down annoying side-quests lame attempt flesh out world . i would prefered game turn based like toee , but this game battles numerous really fun ; partially good monster design .. compare bugbears this game nwn .. so much better , partially unforgettable situations dungeons . when pitted against other dd ruleset games , spell choices offered levels they given superior all others . i actually enjoyed druid my party , who could transform his arms into pythons , first time crpg history actually used summon animals spells . even if many spells simular other games , these felt more tailored characters made useful , instead waiting till higher levels get one useful spell . my favorite part i could handpick my team , where baldur gate i forced play characters i didn't like , or nwn where it removed tedious interact henchmen . i enjoyed rping characters backgrounds , interactions my head , really enjoyed finding treasure , unique iwd2 , like wide variety cut gems . ( which became addiction)if you updated this game graphically level toee , made it turn based battle tactics , it would my all time favorite rpg	1

purchase xbox console dvd movie playback kit matches region which you located . after you buy dvd kit put dvd infrared sensor into your xbox , dvd kit permanently codes your xbox based region your kit from(the region code dvd kit only written outside packaging kit ) . point forward , you only play dvd region xbox dvd kit , ofcourse , dvd carrying label ' all regions ' . you cannot play dvd region even if you later try using dvd kit other region your xbox . instance , if you us region 1 dvd kit you import dvd abroad , say , region code 3 , it not play your xbox console . but here how you change dvd region your xbox play it . 1-send your xbox console repair it re-adjusted play dvd desired region . you pay repair here even if your xbox still warranty period . 2-next , buy dvd kit sold desired region use after your xbox console repaired . here , you only play dvd this region , ofcourse , dvd carrying label ' all regions ' . it permanent change . thus your xbox console acts like ' region specific ' dvd player rather than ' region free ' dvd player . but all said , i no problems dvd kit . i sony dvd player but i find picture clarity better xbox .

" katamari damacy " one best games ever made . it also freshest game . don't let kiddie theme deter you : this extremely playable anyone . music very good genre recordings ; some them accoustic jazz studio recordings japanese , but jazz sound there , especially " gin tonic red red roses , " which noir-ish 15-minute scat vocal swing track percussion , piano , double bass , flute . game two-player mode , which set arena competition see who better . one-player mode story-driven mode king cosmos father your protagonist who little green guy looks similar teletubby . objective use two analog sticks make character push around small ball inside garden or rooms house , or both , into objects normally found those three-dimensional environments , such pairs scissors , mice , golf balls , flowers , paperclips , dining chairs , spoons , anything everything . rolling ball snowball effect , which means more things your character rolls up into ball , larger ball becomes . there big transition moment game where , after rolling ball around rooms house , character breaks out house down driveway farmer market other side street where he starts rolling watermelons until ball gets even larger rolls bicycles , little kids then adults . game play surreal fantasy , but it all comes together its finale abstract epiphany world small enough place understand each other when replacing unnecessary meaningful . more i played this game , hungrier i got , ending surprised me epiphany . it namco who , you know , japanese company produced original pac-man arcade game . since then , it produced several genre games sony playstation including soul edge series , soul blade soul calibur , tekken series , ridge racer/rage racer series , ace combat/air combat series , all which prime landmarks console history . this game so fresh , it struck blow me . strangely , it one those japanese releases almost didn't make it over america . when it brand new , its list price only $20 ; most games $50 upon release . raving critical success " sleeper hit " popularity this game garnered sequel , but i haven't played it yet . any rate , it just may continue one namco great series if it maintains inertia this original one	1

this isn't much like spiderman games i'm used , but it definitely lot fun . good storyline fighting game . single player challenging ( but beatable ) uses most if not all characters . there plenty characters , most different unique powers . there two versus modes : against computer or against friend . computer pretty easy beat . each character it own pros cons . thing i like character levels aren't same ( anybody remember super smash bros ? ) . most games there lot different people but they're mostly same your winning mostly just rides your experience their moves . this there some major strong characters unlocked end . i actually got bored little dissappointed after playing this couple days , but little while ago i started playing again it awesome . recommended comic book fans	-1

i got earlier design this controller . it bigger felt better than regular dual-shock . only down side it analog sticks . top curves like bowl not like knob no grip which means my thumbs kept slipping off . this new controller away problem goes back old knob style analog sticks more grip ... but it size regular controller now but rounded . it fit well hand uses only 2 aa batteries . this controller great , but if when it stop working like other reviewers say , i swap out analog sticks my old logitech controllers . ( little altering needed	1

make no mistake it , this game more than few bugs sudden desktop crashes . it also one most immersive totally enjoyable games i ever played . i am 59 years old played literally hundreds , if not thousands video games since 70 . this game it all far role-playing games go . one bit advice this game save often save often , save often . oh one more thing , sure save often	1
this game awesome . i love play it , i play it everyday . school it gets me way far ahead , much quicker too math . only thing puts game rate overall 4 stars one games you speak out , sometimes it won't take your answer . this happens sometimes , but it kind stinks because your getting tested , so when it won't take it it counts it wrong . but i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you buying this game . it kill alot time . long trips i always take it , whenever i get my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing ds ? it totally rocks ! i used get car sick because i bored , just sitting car , but now i don't get car sick all , because im doing something else . this game made me good , quick math my school . it really helped . this game definitely good all ages even my dad plays it !	1
maybe i'm strange but i liked game . only thing i didn't like zoom feature . i felt could've handled button push like cod3 . graphics remind me time crisis 3-4 . no blood ? i could careless . only kids seem care stuff nowadays . can't seem control your view . put your arm your knee support tweak your controller some . bad ai ? seems like it always bad ai when most get their butts kicked . i believe ai above avg . since it advance you , flank you , hide , draw fire such . yeah there some glitches here there but nothing really whine . if you can't see bad guys you probably need bigger tv . i hitting this guys my friend 13incher no issues . if you can't hit these guys you'll issues cod3 wii well . red steel 2 works so i'm sure they fix some these issues . folks keep complaining . give me online play , some more options multiplayer , bump graphics , more weapons , zoom button i'll buy rs2 well	-1
that exactly what this game says me . i just couldn't refuse . that 2 reasons : i love movies , game nasty . what f***in game man . awesome . i like it better than gta games scarface . maybe it cause i'm such fan movie . maybe it cause i'm sicilian . but i love this game . i haven't glued tv like this since devil may cry 3 . controls great . fighting shooting spectacular . easy get hold . voice overs make it ridiculous listen watch , especially cinema scenes . marlon brando , james caan , robert duvall . only thing ... where al pacino !??! i would sworn he'd it . michael corleone nothing like ... michael corleone . that my only real complaint . why why why isn't he here ??? anyway , back pros . virtual new york city here great . cars driving around , people walking streets conversation . fact you rob banks trucks sick . then there extortion . wow . i love running around extorting businesses . i love fact you things however you like . talk someone man man ( or woman ) . smash up their shop . smack owner around little bit . it fun hell . mob face awesome . i really think my character looks like me . guns crazy . especially upgrades . i got my guns all leveled up they ridiculous . way you create your own character you play part storyline fantastic . it taken me 40 hours become don nyc finish game . only thing i left now find rest film reels . but basically it taken my 40 hours beat game . what hell ? i'll start beginning again	1
this game reminds me alot grand theft auto series . while it many similar characteristics way you get around town , go into buildings , way you interact environment it still manages offer few original interesting components gaming industry . this game great storyline fans likely enjoy . even if you weren't fan movie this game still must . like gta there few side missions ( not massive gta though ) , there collectibles , then you main missions way . while object game take over new york , some warehouses businesses get repetitive , but its mostly all fun . one plus police this game tend less hassle unlike gta games . this lets you keep playing rather than stop restart safehouse or police station . this helps speed up game . controlls take time get used but after you play little while you good go . if you like gta format style play you certainly like this . also if you like godfather , storyline game great really stays true movie . while its not best game year it certainly until new gta comes out . it took me 2 weeks finish game playing few hourse each night . i hope they come up godfather 2 . we see ...	1
this game literally alpha omega its genre . storyline great , characters really good , freedom depth game almost unbelievable . planes , choppers , bikes , cars , you name it ... drug dealing , gun running , cop bribing , you name it . even still , this game 2 or 3 pretty big flaws . namely it not great graphically , but strong pc good graphics card , it hard really complain . what most bothered me half dozen or so missions , objective so poorly phrased so i ended up spending few hours trying wrong thing entirely ! i flying plane trying land it cliff instead hit marker thousand feet air ! directions mission said take it cliff so i ... also , some missions might take lot attempts before you succeed so patience . lame my last quasi complaint , i think storyline could longer ! i wanted see few more missions where carl wuzi fun after big heist i wish cj would definite resolution catalina . if anyone not planed any gta games before , i hadn't either , then this game might overwhelm you first couple nights , you really hate it ! but if you buy it , warned , this game take 2-3 weeks playing 6-8 hours day if you want get close 100% completion it addictive !!	1

first off , many people said , game wonderful movie -- less so game itself . i am not habitual player rpgs sake their gameplay , however -- i stray toward puzzle-solving instant-action games lines ecco dolphin metroid series , respectively -- but i appreciate intricate storytelling genre allows . xenosaga really goes overboard sake its story -- there nothing wrong . game pretentious , open pretentious . cast characters all , greater or lesser degree , mentally ill , heroes villains back again . story takes sudden whiplash-inducing turn last third game . morality decisions made distinctly nietzschean -- which say , often amoral confused . bu t--t he critical but!--it wonderful story often because these facts . if you'd like good story chew over talk your friends ( i'm still talking it , three years after i introduced it ! ) , buy this game . if you want instant action transparent storyline -- eh , give it try . it can't hurt anything . but understand -- when you're going into i t--t hat this more movie than it game ; objective entertain , enlighten , even disturb through visual medium , not necessarily through gameplay itself . oh , , there plenty eyecandy both ladies gentlemen . always bonus . 8	-1

first time final fantasy releasd america final fantasy anthology package . now game where it belongs . handheld system . gba pretty much end its life , but it still manages get satisfactory game every now then . final fantasy no means best series , but it , most part , rpg deserves appreciation acclaim . final fantasy begins character named bartz witnessing meteorite come hurdling ground . when he goes investigate he meets up lenna . lenna searching her father who gone off wind shrine check wind crystal . lately , wind weak , it only because something wrong wind crystal . addition meeting lenna , bartz also meets galuf , man who lost his memory light meteorite crashing . all he remember his name , he too must also go wind shrine . eventually bartz decides travel them , so your adventure begins . truth , final fantasy doesn't good storyline ... least when compared final fantasy iv all final fantasy games appeared after fifth installment . it pretty basic generic . this obvious how fast you'll meet your main party , how much more emphasis put gameplay . these characters not well developed nor story full unbelievable plot twists . except final fantasy not meant storyline . it all gameplay , that where final fantasy excels most . final fantasy iv before it , final fantasy uses atb battle system . all your characters stand one side screen while all enemies stand other . when character atb gauge fills up , you'll able issue commands . game then plays out turn based fashion . final fantasy simple , yet it lot fun , it also provides challenge . gameplay enhanced even more games complex job system . job system extremely complex , even todays standards . you progress through game you'll obtain job classes your characters . there plenty jobs . monks , thieves , white mages , black mages , plenty more . each them learn several different abilities all which useful you your journey . when you select job certain character , you'll battle earn ability points so they learn all abilities they . some abilities more useful than others , possibilities endless . also , once character learns ability , you change jobs them equip it . so black mage could , fact , use white magic , provided he learned ability it . you'll spend lot time field battling get ability points . more abilities you learn , more ability points you'll need next . this fine all , but most enemies don't give up loads ability points . so game puts huge emphasis battling . this also seen low amounts experience enemies also give off . leveling up slow process . good news battling fun , especially job system place . unless everyone jobs same , there nearly endless possibility commands you give middle battle . final fantasy advance sports same extras all previous final fantasy re-releases gba . extra dungeons some extra bosses , that it . nothing too big , but worth price nonetheless . it'll probably take you 20-30 hours complete final fantasy . it not filled brim secrets like future final fantasy titles , but mastering all jobs really keep you busy several hours alone . it also cool because extra dungeons bosses , you'll get four new job classes . this only adds more already complex gameplay . graphically , final fantasy little dated , even gba standards . it looks far better than it final fantasy anthology . it much smoother little bit update , but it doesn't go extra mile it could've . enemies still only flash attack your characters , they're hardly animated . least game great soundtrack . final fantasy goes show why super nintendo era final fantasy music one best series . game just sounds really good . final fantasy golden treat final fantasy fans . it may weak storyline , but what it lacks story it more than makes up gameplay . it not best series , but it still really fun game . good+it lot fun play+the job system makes lot variety your party+great music+the minor graphic updates welcome+bonus dungeons bosses+there huge emphasis gameplaythe bad-not enough graphical update-weak story character	1
i'll admit i little skeptical this game . it turns out , this game rocks ! arena football fans not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make sequel(yeah , i said sequel)they include new afl2 teams . tennessee valley vipers rule	1

i quite unsure whether buy film or not i didn't think it going my type film . but i bought game anyway although i hadnt yet seen film . anyway im glad i ! it only took me two days complete but although it isnt long long , it very good beginning end , basically going round different rooms house doing different things which may seem borin , actually it really fun ! activites etc great ! it definately good game if you like more adventurous games arent too hard , like me , too hard games arent really my type ! now i so cant wait see film which i recently bought	1
truth these memory cards not all much space them , so you certainly want buy two ... i've made thousands saves these cards only ever one go corrupt so say these cards work extremely well understatement . plus , they come variety different colors . there many cheaper memory cards made various manufacturers , but almost all them seem issues some variety , some problems where data magically disappears , some issues saves failing , just avoid hassle altogether . cost/value ratio may seem poor first but just surf around web find 2 29.99 , you won't regret it long run	1
this memory card holds enough game files any gamer use but it way overpriced . i didn't worry this because mine came my ps2 . it hold 40 files , thats 1 file each game . if you over 40 games , like me , you should consider getting value pack comes 2 memory cards . if you buy two black ones , it very expensive you get two memory cards confused . value pack pretty good deal you get red blue memory card so its less confusng .	-1
we've only used mic ( identical ) 10 times now , but no complaints so far . my experience logitech products good past i expect no different this time . we use it karaoke revolution games ps2 . it would nice if there gain adjustment right mic , but may limitation ps2 or game , so i can't hold against mic without knowing more . cord pretty long , i'd say 12 ' or so . whether or not it works pc or if pc-usb mic works ps2 , i don't know . since i don't any complaints , you might wonder why i gave it 4 stars not 5 . me , 4 stars means " it job no major flaws " . 5 stars means " this thing awesome !	-1
those played similar games like sim city before , this one great ! i played sim city 2000 , but years ago . i found game addicting . now , years later , when i ordered sim city 4 : deluxe edition , i blown away ! this game much better than 2000 could hope . they resolved many issues i older game then some . i found this game addicting , started different cities same time . i am working getting " perfect city " me happy . i highly recommend this game anyone who fan any sim games . i could even say times it funny even read tongue-in-cheek sayings come up just you starting up game day like " bureaucratizing bureaucracies " . it not so much hilarious but , it help you get " fun mode " play game . advisors get slightly annoying after awhile , especially when you different idea what you want see your city than they , but it still overall very entertaining game . my next purchase most likely sims 2 , more sims experience	-1
ahh , tekken series . probably most influential series 3d fighting games outside virtua fighter games . tekken 5 welcome return form this true master genre . 4th game just distance memory , this takes series forward ( or back , depending how you look things ) . tekken 5 uses tried trusted tekken gameplay , while still making everything feel fresh . characters , once before just mere clones certain main ones , now fully fleshed out - moves their own . anna williams example , now not clone her sister nina . when people mention tekken , they usually think people who mastered every single command move , while spending hours upon hours practising hone their ' mad skillz ' - it . making game unplayable beginners genre . this , i think , far truth . tekken 5 welcomes new veterans series alike . whereas button-bashing pretenders tekken crown , coughdeadoralivecough , leave you feeling somewhat cold . tekken other hand leaves you feeling great sense satisfaction when you play . yes , tekken 5 its button-bashing characters - but every single character unique ... how unique they look ! arguably best looking ps2 game date . gorgeous backdrops , fluid , realistic animation textures would look home any next-gen console . music wise , it back form mix techno/dance we've come know love tekken . least we say tekken 4 music better ! you've got your usual story mode run through each character . see why they've entered tournament , etc . but this 5th edition borrows human ai mode virtua fighter 4 . this replaced arcade mode name , pits you against humans who uploaded/downloaded their data tekken arcade machine all over world . it welcome challenge , even though it doesn't even compare facing real-life human opponent . all-in-all , this true homecoming master . easily best tekken date , probably best 3d fighter existence . though i am partial abit soul calibur ... heh	1
brings back good old days playing these games after school	-1
i could care less what it original xbox -- what i'm into memory card reader allows you transfer xbox save files over xbox 360 . now i won't start halo all over	1
it pretty fun game . it doesn't whole lot songs , maybe around 30-40 , but ones it fun sing songs generally lot people know , or would willing learn . there also several different modes play , so you play game over over never get tired it . perhaps one best features up 8 people play without any extra expansion packs or controllers ; all you need one controller usb headset you just pass it around everyone play . i agree everyone else , though , when they say headset very flimsy . i originally going get separate headset but bought package deal . bad idea . you practically eat thing sing , it small get caught long hair . plus , you don't get fun karaoke experience . my advice : buy game separately , then get handheld mic . soon i get some more money i'm gonna get handheld mic myself , it picks your voice up better . overall , good buy ! lots fun , especially if you lot outgoing , un-self-conscious people	-1
parents : content this game seems absolutally fine anyone roughly ten up . only reason i see it rated teen because this game requires good bit hand eye cordination sometimes . aslo hulk roaring might get little kids who still around age where they still come up you middle night check there closets monsters , but basicly if your kids handel action cartoons like ninja turtles justice league they deffinately handel this game . anyways ... i wasn't sure this game when i picked it up . i don't know why , i hadn't heard much it i hadn't played many comic book based games besides spiderman based one playstation . but i didn't see many other games rental store kids could play my xbox so i rented it out see if it okay . it , my opinion , absolutaly great game almost anyone . entire game like digital stress ball me , you get rampage your hearts desire . i spent few hours alone week just ignoring story chapters completely just wrecking huge city desert military bases game takes place . kids would also love it same reason they build lego houses then smash them bits their action figures . story bit odd if you don't know much hulk already it revolves around bruces quest cure order stop second more evil cunning hulk bruce banner discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named devil hulk . big green savage hulk we all know love also doesn't like devil hulk moving banner mind , so it becomes more agreeable suconicous orders banner uses get child-like brute what he wants . meanwhile new baddie called abomination appears after one military general stupidly trys recover one bruce failed " cure " attempts very begining game . all all story okay you go , but you tell they tried stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into game story only excuse callenge you bosses other unique situations . far gameplay goes , it fantasic . more damage you cause , more smash points you earn more moves you buy later too continue your assult just everything . there mini games secrets everywhere earn even more smash points . fact , only thing that missing o-o or two player mode . far replayability goes , it always there . anyway , i would recommended this game a)anyone who kids roughly around ten , ) anyone who likes third person , single player games ) anyone one who stress out work one too many times or feels like throwing temper tantrum :)	1
way , jak 3 more direct sequel chapter two than it continuation storyline established part one . i realize this meant end journey , " coming age " story follows title character through his innocence , his adolescence , finally his ascent into adulthood . bearing mind , it only natural he'd want distance himself people places make him feel like adventuring child , rather than self-assured saver globes . " when i became man , i put away childish things , " after all . where inspiration behind storytelling jak ii unquestionably blade runner , main source direction this final chapter comes largely mel gibson road warrior . outlanders who rescue title-endorsed duo their exile drag them back their own makeshift shanty town textbook definition early ' 80s burly man . they adorn themselves hundreds pointy edges , enormous , hopelessly detailed weapons layer after layer questionably-hemmed leather . they puff out their chests every opportunity , speak like cluster throat cancer survivors . these new characters just overflowing personality , which makes minor cutscenes motivational speeches entertaining , but i couldn't shake feeling they just going through motions attempt mimic successful main cast second game . it like they trying match edge gritty , sullen warriors jak ii , but missing some intangible element kept them reaching full potential . twists turns their storylines somewhat transparent ( i'd figured out major twist damas story within hour meeting him ) , their importance central plot thrown into question fairly early , ( when you return city around three hour mark only occasionally return desert thereafter ) all their gusto , their emotional impact player doesn't hold candle inner-city gangs ran chapter two . " last " game series , ( daxter psp jak : combat racing since released , continuing saga , there rumors new game ps3 ) jak 3 atypical grand finale . lot things didn't happen i expected during " wrap up " cutscene very end , vice-versa ... i caught off guard more than few revelations , including wizard oz-styled reveal just before final boss . first time , i think series found its stride vein comedy it sought since day one . character interactions actually very funny places - i legitimately laughed out loud more than one occasion , which not something i'm known during game . outline place unexpected twists turns counteracting few more obvious revelations , jak 3 story would set stage one greatest final chapters video gaming history - if only it bit longer . jak 3 weighs dozen hours , which less than half length jak ii , results much less rewarding experience than you'd hope final episode . it also wasn't nearly difficult its immediate predecessor , which means less screaming shouting , but also less relief self-assuredness upon reaching final scene . after completing part two , i sense accomplishment , almost pride , finished such elaborate difficult game . i didn't get same sensation upon putting this one bed . one area which jak 3 doesn't disappoint " holy crap " department . it just spoils you these things - you'll control daxter he clings dear life onto speeding missle , ( live freaking missle ! ) you'll leap onto teensy platform while camera leers above you displays dizzying heights below , you'll take down creatures size whale ... just unimaginably cool stuff . it doesn't overload action quite way god war , but it pretty close , last full hour gameplay one those long moments transcends mere video gaming puts player right into middle summer blockbuster . i've long considered last stage original halo one , if not greatest level history gaming , i'd seriously consider closing moments jak 3 least par . so , yeah , very high praise indeed . both grand finale throughout entirety game , there lot variety gameplay . this not just your standard jump , shoot explore adventure game . you'll bump into odd blend flight stages , ddr-style coordination stages , racing levels railed first person shooter segments , addition exploring , jumping , punching , shooting all-around adventuring levels . , while this something i big problem when it shoved into mechanics grand theft auto : san andreas , it doesn't bother me so much here . main reason because jak series always some sort similar variety ingrained within it , but it also bit more admissible here because setup actually works . nothing feels like it needlessly crammed into proceedings , like dance stages or workout levels san andreas ... it all just works together , several parts whole . while basic gameplay model ( its dedication consistently bending genres ) remained mostly intact , there two notable variations functionality jak ii become abundantly clear within first couple hours . first foremost much , much heavier emphasis that placed driving stages , more so than precursor legacy jak ii combined . this third chapter , they're vital completion half game levels , including final boss fight . it almost point i'd call this " action / racing " title , because you'll find yourself spending much time behind wheel you foot . when it successful , vehicle-based gameplay blast , something that never really tried before - sort supercharged platformer wheels . few stages failed , however , wheels felt like gimmicky death trap . incredibly frustrating , like trying shove square peg through round opening . largely , vehicle stages roaring success , however . secondly , there revelation there " light jak " mirror beastial " dark jak " unveiled second game . where jak darker persona brought it variety new attacks offensive maneuvers , his light side focuses more exploratory aids defensive mechanisms . such , it not quite exciting play " light jak " first time it burst into " dark jak " mode near opening jak ii . it just not much fun grow wings casually flutter around room it fire purple lightning out your fingertips fry opposition . these light powers enable few new modes exploration die-hard fan , but generally fairly useless go unused until situation demands you employ them . fas far controls concerned , it pretty tight ship this point series . most infuriating glitches bugs first game ironed out second chapter , third game actually improves upon near-perfection attained second . few jump commands go unrecognized , i some problems touchy collision detection during faster races ( which meant i hit checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again ) but those minor gripes best . visually , this could pass jak ii identical twin . characters look almost exactly same previous chapter , all little quirks , cartoony exaggerations background puns gave first two games their identity here living color . it not best looking game i've ever played , i didn't notice much difference upon switching progressive scan , but it near top its genre all same . i'd imagine phrase " ain't broke , don't fix it " could applied jak 3 without hesitationthe voice acting one area that kept fairly high quality throughout series , legacy kept up here . where story falters , voice actors often revive it , vice versa ... it good collaboration . scenes routinely stolen daxter / or villains , who go above beyond their pursuit good reading matches circumstances , while jak kept fairly low-key stoic . it best , too , because few occasions where he decide go all macho tries spit out line like " let go kill us some metal heads , " it doesn't fit he comes across awkward unsure . upon completing second game , i likened it empire strikes back , it took fairly light-hearted series transformed it into more adult-oriented saga , incredible results . what it worth , star wars parallel carries over fairly accurately this third chapter - you'll get lots warm fuzzies end , it not quite weighty or substantial second chapter , but overall it still very entertaining experience cast characters you can't help but love . big action scenes really fabulously , there rarely dull moment , but this game suffers unbelievable quality game immediately preceded it	-1
this game outstanding graphics great 3-d gameplay , plus you really battle it out online or instant action . add few , you play clone wars or galactic civil war , bad thing though clone wars main battles naboo , honest clone wars started geonosis episode ii not i . i love this game because you use guns other awesome weapons , you also play wookies , clones , droids , rebels , imperials . if you beginner video game player or new star wars when you choose " create file " try using easy . this game follows movies really well you explore mos eisley or maybe naboo if you like . more battles you win , bonuses you get . if you read instruction booklet it says if you go killing spree against enemies you get really cool bonus . i highly recommend this game all star wars fans ! game let you play most greatest battles all time . so , if you want good long-lasting game try this , i really hope star wars fans love game . multi-player mode great i really enjoy playing it . this game great i love it . try playing it yourself ! i am wrap this review up so listen , this game great xbox terrific gameplay features you want play it all time even though it online or single-player you still fun know it all out star wars action ! this game great i just love playing it ! i know this one out two battle front games soon three i enjoy playing this ! buy it .... now ! p.s. buy every thing star wars	1
although i don't own my own xbox - i always play someone else because i already own ps2 , i never-the-less feel obligated add my thoughts matter . new xbox controller one sleek piece equipment - far superior original monstrousity controller those idiots microsoft initially came up ( it super ugly , gigantic , clunky original controller turned me off buying xbox when it came out ) . new controller visually appealing eyes . although ps2 controller still slightly more attractive , controller extremely close second . controller smaller handier than original , easier use controls , very comfortable grip . just compare different controllers xbox , ps2 , gamecube holding them your hands , fiddling around controls . you see xbox controller nicest fit them all palms your hands ( gamecube least comfortable ) . ironically controller originally designed xbox release japan because original controller deemed too big japanese players . i really think those folks microsoft should plan things little better before jumping game ...	-1
i am huge star wars fan , but i don't really like rpg all much ( least not video games ; i play dnd ) . said , this game absolutely blew me away . dnd player , i knew there wouldn't learning curve game since it uses d20 system . knowing system really helped feat selection such , there really wasn't anything outlandishly new . i , however , little disappointed small number force powers game . i don't think i would bother my main character jedi consular , you really get decent amount force powers even jedi guardian ( if you some wisdom enhancing items , you use those powers often well ) . character creation system pretty standard . i slightly disappointed you human , i really wanted create lightsaber-wielding wookie , but purpose story , it won't take you long figure out human definitely good thing taris . fact wookie eventually joined my party later adequetely mollified me . fact , it really doesn't matter too much what kind character you make , because party members you pick up throughout game pretty much everything covered . one small warning without giving too much away : your travels you meet party member , order explore his backstory you need your main character decent rank repair skill . it not really big deal if you're set making soldier/jedi guardian amazing melee combat but not able raise skill too much . but you perfectionists like explore every single aspect game , you should keep this mind . note you perfectionists : you not explore every aspect game one run . this because your actions throughout game determine whether you become hero light side force or fall dark side . naturally , there two different endings . i imagine game experience bit different well . i personally stuck light side , which little more difficult times since you'll helping people more . however , this also means you more side quests . i imagine dark side would somewhat guilty pleasure , you just kill people seek your aid you progress through game little faster taking " quick easy path . " there also third option pretty much balancing yourself neutral . respond evil sith occasionally , sometimes valiant jedi . you usually respond neutrally well . overall , i'd say aspect this game shines brightest story characterization takes place ( this reason stick light side : oftentimes you just tell your party members shut hell up gain dark side points , but you won't get explore their backstories discover their motivations ) . anyone star wars fan thoroughly enjoy playing game story nearly on-par movies ( even better than prequels ! ) obviously story bit restricted since it video game meant played , but plot certainly better than any video game i've played before ( when i younger i play games like golden sun baldur gate ; kotor beats them hands down ) . most it pretty new territory , game takes place few thousand years before movies . i'll close few warnings . first , you'd better good graphics card if you want play this game . you should fine if you meet minimum system requirements , but first time i tried install this game my older computer ( still not old though ) it didn't good enough graphics card . computer it now still doesn't meet recommended system requirements , but it more or less fine . leads me into my final warning : there some bugs game . after only few hours , certain point game would freeze up , occasionally exit windows . i worried i wouldn't able complete game because it happened many times . i downloaded updates game , this help some , but it didn't completely solve problem . eventually i turned off something silly like grass effects or shadows caused it happen much less frequently . i guess all left say if you're star wars fan you should buy this game . even if you're not , it still worth playing through , especially if you like rpg . oh , this goes without saying , but quick save often .	1
when it comes gc/gba cable . you wouldnt think something this inexpensive could make difference way you play video games . but it it unlocks secrets all kinds gamecube games , sometimes it gives you access secret areas/maps/items various other thing . depending game what features it opens up . plus it cheap get once you've gotten this wonderful item . you wonder why you didnt get it sooner . i know my own experience .	1
i haven't finished this game , though i'm quite close it . i say this game quite possibly most fun i've long time . i laughed out loud more than few times , nearly constantly smiling , thoroughly amused all little details . not much stylus action , but then again ... you really expect there ? my boyfriend highly considering getting ds lite simply so he play this game .	1
this first person shooter you battle through star wars battles through all episodes , fighting soldiers republic side . you chance play jedi ehich more power than normal soldier . , you opportunity " instant action " . where you choose battlefield pick side fight . also , you choose conquer galaxy , but it really boring . this game really fun , but it starts get boring after awhile . so , get some friends play multiplayer or splitscreen . also , yoda awesome	-1
i all " grand theft " games this one my favs . i highly recommend it all others . i recently purchased " liberty city " awesome	1

final fantasy iii , most may know , only final fantasy game failed reach north america . well now it haas revived , it better than ever before ! " improved " 1 ) final fantasy pushed ds graphics limit . though figures may not crystal clear , though it may seem slightly pixelish , it probably best you'll ever get nintendo ds . ffiii completely 3d , step up it original , character changes appearence you change his/her job ! 2 ) job system what solely drives this game . some may read , yes , there 279841 different party combinations . obviously , this opens up many doors many strategy . ffiii incorperates these 23 jobs smart way well . don't suprised when some job adjustments must made defeat certain boss . your party all fighting , or all magic , all range , or all skills , or mix any ! jobs earned when crystals discovered , you find use each them . 3 ) ffiii played entirely touch screen , or entirely buttons , so you use either method whenever you want . ffiii complements ds touch screen capability quite nicely ; able use it select moves much better than buttons . 4 ) ffiii also wi-fi compatible . it , players send messages other players global , using internet port . it isn't much , but it something ! 5 ) you may name all your characters , play any or them , any time ! i like freedom . things could better ... 1 ) story line very redundant , copy previous ff games . it isn't big deal , but you'd think tthey'd get bit more original ! 2 ) command buttons during battle very small , so using touch screen often makes you mis-hit command . 3 ) this game requires lots patience , because battles very tedious sometimes , most gameplay spent traing . 4 ) each job doesn't variety skills , but rather only one . it gets very old once you maintain same job long time . 5 ) wi_fi isn't very creative , there no 2 player ffiii . 6 ) fights not incorperate time bars . say , you take 5 years make move without attack enemy . make it short sweet ... die hard ff fans must get this game , mainly complete their ff colections , but also great time . not die hard fan ? no worries . rpg best you'll find ds or psp . it got plenty , won't fail you any time . those who don't enjoy strategy games , however , or not patience grow their characters may want stay away this game . i loved it , but hey , it just what i think . this review brought you son fun	-1

nfs most wanted ok , but there few things i don't like it . variety cars mediocre , controls horrible . how you eliminate old fashioned way control using pad ? i absolutely hated . amount vehicles horrible ... only 37 . nfs hot pursuit 2 , there close 50 . i am not thrilled tuning feature , what deal nos ? way i see it , if you need nos your car , then your car isn't fast enough . i like police ai , that just incredible , 3d models vehicles incredible . gameplay great combining elements hot pursuit 2 , underground , underground 2 helps game , but variety cars hinders it	-1
this game what prequels couldn't me ... it drew me back into star wars universe vengence . i am not real big gamer , really don't like console games but this game must any fan , casual or hardcore . knights also comes pc version those who don't access console or like me don't really care them . fact pc version more mods available it i believe so i would probably recommend it first . knights , or kotor it known fan community set 4000 years before new hope . it sweeping tale talented padawan who comes late force holds fate galaxy their hands . since this rpg best part jedi you ! what really drew me this game well developed storyline flushed out characters . other members you party backstorys play directly into plot form sidequests during course game . you almost feel like they real i found myself becoming emotionally attached party memebers story progressed . their responses also influenced your dialog choices , even affect main character relationships other party members . this bioware game well so there option romance one other party members . you also choose which side force follow . player either quintessential light jedi , evil palpatine , or somewhere inbetween . your choices throughout game affect your alignment force also what powers less exhausting use . dialog fantastic rarely comes off cheesy ( unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless ) voice actors who portray other characters wonderful . even dialog main character option funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment . game gives you choice play male or female character which actually influences what side quests you pick up , well minor effect main story . personally i thought this most gratifying aspect game . i got play kickin female jedi who holds fate galaxy her hands . due this well ability choose your alignment there four possible endings this game . knights able hold excellent replay factor well due number mods available game other fans . lucasarts actually encourages even supports fan mad mods thier website . when you get bored main storyline there mods out there change everything looks clothes force powers even dialog . there even mod out there restores cut fifth ending only available female character . game mechanics pretty easy get handle . combat options give you ability either choose what attacks each character your party use or leave them automated . those who aren't real familiar computer games should able pick up basics fairly fast . those who like first person shooters may find it little frustrating attacks themselves automated . me this plus i'm not fan " button smashers . " work advice someone who hasn't played game or isn't familiar it storyline , avoid searching internet info it much possible . this may frustrating if you someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me , storyline twist not something you want spoil . you'll enjoy game storyline much more if you don't spoil surprise . there gaming sites where you get cheats only cheats if your cheater like me . not only teen players enjoy it but i know plenty 20 30 somethings who adore this game . it great job capturing feel original trilogy . if you like star wars all , run ... don't walk buy this game	1

" dude supy " gave this game bad review . " supy " likely 20-years old advanced palette video games . it best suited children 6-12 , like my two children who big fans lemony snicket movie . game follows movie pretty closely , graphics pretty good , if you're not very skilled gamer ( like my 6-year old ) it okay because if you " die " you just restart task . i few technical complaints , but this game definitely lives up my 5-star rating	-1

castlevania series games involving vampires side scrolling combat . dawn sorrows , soma cruz teenager who soul dracula within him . year ago ( game before this one ) he fight off dark powers within him . he won thought his life would normal again . unfortunately , when this game opens , he immediately comes under attack vanquish new set foes . game pixel based side-scroller involves human figures fighting skeletons , werewolves , other monsters . look definitely old school / retro . if example you ran this side side against robots , title i reviewed recently , robots figures crisp detailed , while castlevania characters screens showed granularity . it style difference many people appreciate . you primarily move left right , slashing your sword , throwing bones , performing other styles attacks take out your enemies . there some platforming well , jumping up down ladders get new areas . this works well storyline , so it not like , say , mario where platforming all there game . example , there ' hunter ' who sworn kill dracula . soma knows hunter , understands hunter fight him if he loses control himself dracula . they enemies who truce , who both respect each other , but who know if circumstances change they lock comba t.t here some touch screen aspects game . you find ' seals ' which essence patterns lines . perform certain actions - example finish off boss - you create this seal . this involves drawing pattern perfectly . you're allowed practice , but when time comes , if you don't get seal just right , you could great trouble . it neat idea , but i wish it something little less " perfectionist " oriented . i know many people who just can't draw well or who hands shake bit . if they'd gone memorization game - or logic puzzle or something - it would more real skill / intelligence less " perfectly steady hands " . general i like fun action , i appreciate rpg storyline here . i got drawn into story rather quickly . i think next version i would like see graphics kicked up match ds capabilities , ' seal ' puzzle changed less perfectionist drawing , i'd also like some dialogue less cliche . i loved ' flow ' plot but winced several comments made characters . well recommended	-1

this game when released best 1st person shooter console game available . but today doom half life versions xbox , there actually something compare halo , it doesn't stand up . first off , plot utterly pointless . i never felt invested or sympathetic master chief , just frustrated when he died i would replay section . weapons lame . released after pc version quake iii , halo weapons seem limp comparison . none " futuristic " aspects seem particularly believeable or useful , matter . vehicles suck . driving vehicles halo fun operating forklift , which actually quite entertaining gta san andreas , so maybe it not quite fun . i guess it more like driving " super action wacky bike " southpark " chimpocoman " episode . 2 player story mode rules ! best part game only reason reccomend it it great game play friend . multiplayer deathmatch average . give halo props first decent multiplayer battle xbox , but it wasn't good it pc competition when it came out- much older quake iii still looked played better- now seems ok but no better than mos t.t hat said 2 player campaign multiplayer make this good 10-15$ diversion , just don't expect immersive atmosphere doom iii or intriguing plot twists half life ,	-1
well , list games below so i'm not going go through it . commodore 64/128 child i played these games their day . i console collection so i loved video games since i child . how many levels full games you could fit just 64k memory 350k disks back then . anyway , this collection some most beloved games era , least ones they could license use it . epyx games some best their time , games like impossible mission fun solve finish they not easy solve either . jumpman , international karate epyx games test your reflexes abilities perform exact moves joystick commands get higher scores . i fun playing this little piece gaming history , games not only flashy graphics ( though they make difference ) but how much fun you get game . when i kid , i used dream days i could see graphics games like ones we see today . these units hacked if you wish take flash drives more games , change game list or even add joysticks keyboards but that something you search know how . few programmers technicians who worked commodore computers back then found out how this even provide instructions how perform these modifications if you're skillful enough . i really like this product part my collection now , games not emulated c64 motherboard reengineered shrunk size small chip so you're playing games 100% reproduction accuracy , i wish i could give it whole five stars but i'll give it four because joystick could bit more responsive or perhaps like user mentioned it could i first version perhaps this addressed new version . overall , great fun product	1

this game matches real thing quite well , but too few questions endure . if you've never seen show , it simply series fifteen , each increasing dollar amount until last , million-dollar question . it drawn out . there speech clip each dollar amount , answer , other things . infamous quot ; final answerquot ; option only appears when you take while answer , unfortunately . lifelines realistic , minus fact quot ; phone friendquot ; really quot ; phone regis friendquot ; . quot ; fast fingerquot ; scrambles choices , first correct key pressed wins . graphics pretty good there neat animations . i recommend this millionare fanatics or trivia people , but only those who won't run out questions	-1

this enjoyable game , educational well . price , it worth buying . puzzles aren't difficult , but challenging enough keep it interesting . game reminded me easier version myst . you don't need prior knowledge physics - handy reference guide available part gameplay . only drawback screen small . maybe could fixed , but i didn't want mess setup since some games finicky xp .	1
don't let screen name fool you . i'm actually guy . but , getting out way , i'm really into music , i eyetoy , so i got groove . it atmosphere extremely feminine , but this great game . there only 23 songs begin , grand total 5 unlock . ( yippie ! ) however , girls , this very good party game , guys , try it out . you'll feel like pussy , but you'll fun doing it . overall , this great rythm game , but it minor leagues when compared its awesome competitors , like dance dance revolution guitar hero	-1
my daughter got eye toy her birthday , we recently added dance groove game collection . she her friends ( 10 yrs age ) really enjoy it , some younger kids . she says her only complaint most difficult skill level nearly impossible master , so they improvise ... which pretty easy if you stand really close camera .	-1
disgaea 2 fun , cartoony combination rpg tactical game . you adell , young fighter , who pairs up rozalin order defeat evil zenon . you build up party characters , including fighters , healers , pretty much any monster type you defeat battle . you wander through lands , you often find monsters conquer . during these battles , you end up grid . each character move certain distance per turn , get around behind your enemy . some ways game like typical rpg . there evil main boss conquer . there various smaller enemies way . there power-ups collect weapons buy . graphics not meant realistic or cutting edge . they casual , cute , fun . disgaea really shines its humor . it not meant really little - its characters joke looking up girls ' skirts there swears such " kick their ass " . still , game generally very family friendly ton fun it . most villagers turned into demons quite wild personality changes . main character - adell - still human . when you go around talking other people , one muses why adell still human . " it because he main character " ? rozalin , zenon daughter , very spoiled , stuck-up teen girl her dialogue quite funny . many flaws other games taken care here . when you go into shops , they new items each time , giving you selection choose you find interesting . you customize new characters , creating party just perfect your gaming style . voices cutesy traditional anime style , sounds fit well world . plot fairly involved really draws you . again , this isn't dark , serious story angst power . it fun , light-hearted romp through fun fantasy world , where you play few hours , save , pick up story next time you free time . well recommended	-1
picked up game only today , perhaps i shouldn't review it just yet , since i've only played it couple hours . but initial response @mn good . fact , disgaea 2 seems improve all ways its predecessor . story seems quite deep ( i'll spoil none what i've discovered , although you pretty much find it all out reading around ) . graphics better ( but still not up snuff - it reason i dropped game star ) . there incredible number extras game , voices much better ( least my opinion ) . no , there no laharl ( main character , although i haven't given up seeing him , or main character phantom brave , almost-assuredly present end dungeons ) , but this game ( least early ) pretty good nonetheless . i'll try , uhhh , review my review , i play more , but initial observations point many more hours wasted this series ... addendum : now , completed main game embarked subplots , i confidently say this game trumps last disgaea , highest praise i give it . this incredible game , layers strategy , plenty power-levelling if you so desire . i only wish i could change 4 5 stars overall . you cannot go wrong this one , if only optional dungeons alone ( which include dark worlds , land carnage , trip laharl , date mid-boss , even opening extra ) . nippon ichi , my hat off you . you made one best games ever	1
i originally put off playing this game because i feared it would ruin integrity ffvii me . i also heard many bad reviews all over place it . however , i found it very fun game . first i few gripes camera voices . it clumsy , unfocused , generally all over place some voices just wrong(but luckily vincent okay ) . however , story engaging enough i adjusted camera after while . while it pretty much like every other shooter(you shoot things , run around , get items , shoot things some more ) , it some familliar interesting things sets it aside . first , it fills some things vincents story ffvii people may recall . then , there familliar settings . one these settings(which completely freaked me out ) burned out version shinra building . good thing use materia . it equipped weapons used . then there returning characters , which it always enjoyment see . gameplay fast chaotic , but fun way . there even special boss end .......... overall , pretty fun game	-1
my son loves this controller . it fits well his hands similar feel regular corded ps2 sony controller . it doesn't same rumble feature , but button turn rumble feature off . overall , it best cordless he used yet	1

i loved xenogears when it known they going bring out xenosaga i so looking forward it . well 1 didn't disapoint which led 2 .!! then there 2 , well talk letdown . then talk 3 started . first i unsure if i wanted lay down any more money disapointed yet again ... but wow am i glad i . it beauty watch play . many answers games 1 2 found it breath taking cut scenes . im not going spoil things you but just say wow isnt enough discribe cgi twist turns . i just hope you enjoy this game much i	1
xenosaga : episode 1 took us . although flaws game many , story sufficiently entertaining interesting warrant praise given game , clunky play mechanics . xenosaga : episode 2 awful . plain simple , it awful . any interesting cliff-hangers episode 1 either answered stupidly , or not all . game not only possessed lackluster storyline , extra characters introduced merely confusion sake , but i never seen battle system more user-unfriendly , more monotonous clunky than episode 2 . times , i wanted throw my ps2 against wall , particularly when fighting patriarch . terrible game which seemed kill series ...... until episode 3 , which throwback simpler rpg fare , works quite well . episode 3 , battles actually interesting fight ( least early - i enjoy use boost counter once ! ) . no more you guess whether shion attack useful against enemy , or whether you should switch , say , chaos . instead , characters divided into three classes : attackers , defenders supporters ( healers ) . it pretty simple system , no ? also , story kicks back into high gear . i won't spoil anything , except say finally , testaments , which alluded episode 1 but completely ignored ( other than tangential referral ) episode 2 , returned , let face it : wilhelm much more compelling character than , say , young albedo . finally , wheels which began spinning episode 1 come full circle . fact , it seems if episode 2 could skipped entirely , no loss continuity . there numerous nods xenogears this game , way , gear sequences actually quite fun ( character battles episode two only trumped boredom ... gear battles ) . any case , xenosaga 3 worthy addition library . it flaws ( again , it would nice action sequences movie sequences move more seamlessly , although it infinitely better than episode 1 or 2 ) , but it fun game	-1
xenosaga : episode 3 ( also sprach zarathustra ) brings back magic episode 1 fixes vast majority problems occurred episode 2 . story here , rich complex ever , brought appropriate moving close shion company battle uncover deep-seated conspiracy unlike anything else they've ever encountered . fabric story itself , voice acting , cutscenes all truly superb - it remarkable makers namco/bandai managed pull all loose ends together make story finally make sense . boot , it pleasure watch listen -- who could ask more ? battle system , it finally regains its fun episode 3 . i simply wasn't fan episode 2 system , so return " basics " blessing my mind . characters still battle their unique ways , each his/her own customizable skills obtain , but long gone days ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies . here , both ground e.s. ( mech ) battles , your ability strengthen customize your party shines through you always rewarded your hard work . replay value moderate-to-high well , since your party consists all familiar players most game ; if you habit using same three or four people ( like me ; yay chaos ! ) , you always play through again different group . shops return this episode , making buying selling your merchandise once again possible . only thing lacking this game little more " extras/side quests " department , which this game only offers handful . while some these take longer than others , few more side quests would nice , particularly since this last series . i can't rave enough how impressed i this title . it rivals episode 1 every way possible , trilogy epic story outstrips other rpg competition without question . if you're looking fun battles , fantastic story , beautiful graphics , then look no further ; xenosaga : episode 3 you . i only hope someone changes their mind decides make one -- after this exceptional closing episode , it hard not wish game come future . very highly recommended . summary : story : a+cutscenes : agraphics/rendering : abattle/skill system : aextras/side quests : a-replay value : moderate-to-hig	1
this controller very nice probably best . it works big small hands it feals non greasy(unless you greasy hands ) it nice vibration if you notice some other controllers vibration too big . now i own playstation 2 i played lot other controllers but they dont last buttons get pushed analog too sensitive etc . although this controler ive it 2 years it yet break me people this sensitive object dont slam it it work well long you take care it . also button reaction this quickest i seen those big bulky ones reaction very bad sometimes analogs dont work properly . you may also seen this controller black teal there all same price all same durability only differene color . i rate this item 5 stars because its best controller out there	1
anybody out there controller hog who perhaps gets your controller sticky or messy or something it you don't even want know ? different colored controllers key solving this problem . mr. messy his you yours ! it works out awesome ! i love my teal green controller he loves his blue one ! you also get year warranty , which comes box this controller , yellow cardboard so if there problem year they fix your controller . anyway it same size ones come your original ps2 . buttons same , they move same , feel same . only difference color , but still it worth it get nice new non-sticky controller get your self some distance controller hog . i love this one , they also make teal colored one , i seen sponge bob controller out there well but if its not made sony its probably not reliable . stick best , get sony controller get game	1

i found this product good , i no problems it what so ever . some people say just buy dvd player but then you more wires back your tv . also if you want your box dvd player go into one suround sound or stereo great cause you get dvd player box one wire going into speakers . this also great if you dont want spend any more money buying dvd player you already xbox . i my xbox upstairs dvd adapter , dvd player down stairs so if i want change secnery . i love my xbox it adapter i no problem remote either	1
very good cable . get it if you ps2 component input your tv . much better picture than composite cables	1
when i first got my hdtv , i tried my ps2 it , although widescreen feature nice , picture grainy . i disappointed , but i knew i must missed something . something these cables . if you want your games look good your hdtv , you need these cables . such difference , i can't believe i got such improvement this price . seriously , if you spent money tv , spend money cables , cause you're only strong your weakest link	1
this game very fun because you able change and/or create your own characters many different ways , there different games you play than just plain karaoke , it ways encouraging you better . each location you choose fun things happen when you sing more tune , like if you sing rooftop building , you're doing awesome , helicopter comes starts filming you live cam ! it lot like american idol how you're glamourized . only thing i don't like it song choice limited . there ways you " earn " new songs doing well , but i wish there way you could add more songs songlist we personally could choose	-1
okami fantastic game , perhaps last great game released ps2 . stylish , fun , packed good bit humor , this game kept me occupied over week . although it certainly played good bit faster , most people probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through first time . action-adventure style gameplay owes quite bit zelda series , but celestial brush adds nice ( original ) gameplay element . okami not overly difficult , i found it bit easy side . camera also bit troublesome few places well , but i would hard pressed find many other faults this game . unless you real dislike cel-shaded graphics , i would heartily recommend this game any ps2 owner	1
i thought there could more some story line . i'v playing gta vice city san andreais , like stoury line . but overall i pleased game	-1
fable much anticipated rpg promised 40-50 hours gamer action storyline complete control over life protagonist . we waited this game what seemed like lifetime build up game finally arrive almost more than rpg lovers could take , but it live up hype ? no , my fellow gamers . it hurts me so say it . while game promised deliver several hours stoyline play i shocked when i completed main storyline less than 20 hours . now , i'm not one doubt sacred words lionhead studios , so i dedicated 20 hours my life uncover different aspects gameplay , such getting married , changing outfits body types , becoming divinely evil or majestically good ( ect . ) , but it all just so linear ! paths set , storyline already thought out , character chosen , you weren't given enough keep interest going . i later dragged myself back game play storyline through again , though i admit i enjoyed game much more second time through , i just found myself not caring it all . too many options closed darn story just too short !! darker elements game simply addicting such colleseum , prison ( which i played over over over ) , story your sister , but it seems though people charge developing such side stories ( which we all so love !!! ) got little case a.d.d. now , i'm not saying avoid this game . it got just what some gamers may need get into rpg , but those us who expecting game completely pwn morrowind , well , let just move ... or wait better thought our sequal . * crosses fingers	-1
my son ( 11 years old ) i played this together blast . it fun watch him play alone too . when his cousins come over they all take turns playing together seem really like it . great fun rainy days	-1
when i heard this game first , i stunned . ddr guitar hero both games focus " dance-like " " guitar-like " motions , but they not rely actual ability dance or actual ability play guitar , merely combinations responses through specialized controllers . karaoke revolution , however , actually guages accuracy your singing . your performance based how closely original song you sing your version , measured pitch voice . i would expected , tradition ddr guitar hero , karaoke revolution would " simplified singing " , hitting certain buttons controller produce certain singing notes screen . but no , this game uses real microphone your real voice . game also uses popular karaoke songs universally singable . it may not entirely my genre music i would sing karaoke bar , but almost all songs , i heard make passable attempt singing , there wide spread across genres across eras so most genres represented , there both older very modern music . i only used this game myself sing practice songs actual karaoke , but i imagine this game incredibly fun party well . it uses actual versions songs essentially like competitive karaoke ! , beyond , it also straightforward karaoke feature plays karaoke versions songs , complete words , straight-up karaoke parties such . this game one several this genre , i am personally looking forward playing all them . my only critique there limited numbers songs , thus , me least , limited playing time . if there on-line version this game could access much larger database songs play ( much like karaoke bar ) , i would gladly pay monthly fee play such game . let hope such thing works	-1
i dont this games , but my freind party we played it nonstop . it awsome game , but only place i find noncountry ones carcut city . when i went theresomeone baught it before me . i am so happy i found it amazon . i love it it , i say , one only reasons why i want leave my freinds . juat kidding . if you love sing want famous singer this game 4 you . i think it helps you sing better because it tells you pich if you dont get right pitch it comes your score	1
well i've played this few hours since it just came yesterday but i'm already very impressed . graphics incredible , i didn't think ds capable such pretty 3-d zoom graphics . there 23 different job classes game ( ex . white wizard , knight , sage , etc . ) , which fans final fantasy tactics recognize . able shift jobs work towards more powerful ones melds best rpg tactics . other words , crazy awesome good . probably handheld game year , probably biggest rpg christmas season . ****	1
only faults i find this otherwise great game horribly long load times how long it takes get decent car race . game very addictive , especially when it comes tuning your hard-won new car . customization your car extremely detailed almost fun racing . computer cars give you real challenge certain types races , but you change difficulty level if you find it little too hard first . scenery gorgeous ! able drive anywhere you want really fun too . i actually prefer this game over ea newer release : most wanted . i would recommend this game , but patience needed your first few hours gameplay	1
this game blast . i am female , addicted cars . girl we like modify things like sims such paint pick choose , so it great girls this aspect . but able modify car it great general . most us dont money put all these mods our vehicles so its great just play around ideas . far racing i blast , i however find it difficult maneuver cars certain situations , but eventually you get hang i t.t his high addictive game . i would recommend any car lover	1
what i say memory cards ? well , they're nice looking , their colorful translucent casings . i've using mine month now , no problems	1

i rarely rate or write reviews video games , cds , or movies ... but i feel this game deserves all props it get . honestly when i first saw ad it i thought it looked interesting but none my friends or family heard it , so i reluctant buy first . however , my roomate i decided buy this game play it through together , it ended up even better than my favorite final fantasy video game series . sotc unique story line , decent music , but most all most beautiful innovative gameplay i encountered . idea just fighting giant creatures throughout free roaming world amazing , able climb up them use terrain best your advantage . no " trash mobs " each colossus relief too , because i feel though it would made game more cliche unenjoyable . i could talk all day this , but sake listening me rant ... go buy this gam	1
good : * gameplay - overall , combinations enemies vs weapons/spells well . you buy every weapon , go back easier parts see how each weapon " fights " . you light/heavy short/long different damage . you also option using different spells . this those like me who want prolong game . i can't block/roll ( .. physically disabled ) , so i go " best defense good offense " strategy . you many options how win = you thus make game more difficult or easy based your decisions . * weapons - many choices . light/heavy ; short/long ; low damage/high damage ; augmentstions etc ... you try differnet weapons out per whatever part game ; if you want proplong adventure :-) . some weapons just plain look cool ! * spells - well , i my favorites , but tried them all . some work much better than others vs certain enemies . you pick choose !. i believe you beat game only 3 , but i used my favorite 6 = spice things up . * story - well thought out . * battles - many major fights * xp/gem runs - i think 3 spots where you increase these important categories . nice when added game ! * bugs - only few desktop crashes ; xp/sp2all all , you not overwhelmed too many options . just get there fight :-) bad : * voiceovers - sounded like 1-2 people all voices * women/villagers - basically same model * romance - well , one giggles talk ; other actually seems enjoy you . third option wife special npc seems reading poor romance novel . ok , you hit esc button ? if they wanted go down this path , designers should put more variety/work into this option . why no romance whisper ... would fit story + changed same-nesswhy no romamce briar rose - above . why no romance bordello lady - same above . wouldn't fit story , but changed same-ness . if you decide give them refuge , shouldn't ladies talk you ; open romance ? they just stood there posed . why can't i buy clothes my wives ... could buy dress myself * maps - i liked trek guild oakvale : much fight . i would go back forth several times . hoped run into nymphs :-) seems once you get knothole glade , you really don't feel need go roaming look something fight/do . ok , you arena ; lots fun here = unless you hero save , you it once . hook coast - just part/path final showdownsnowspire - well , it it if you last soul . what point talking villagers ; getting married etc , you spent no time these places . there could cave or forrest or swamp ; or combination give one something while these villages . seems final 1/3 game just " rushed upon you " ... you feel like ; " might well just keep questing " get this over . i would liked slow down , wander around ; etc ... if you didn't equipment/spells now , you won't get them coming hook coast/snowspire . all i remember value would some xp or " boosting potions " . if they just quest driven locals , then only map would needed = i saw no reason get wife ; buy anything this point * hero save - ok if you want xp/key runs . i've heard crashing problems if you over it . but , those longer/tougher quests , you really want redo several hours if you die or want stop ? i'm my 6th replay = 240hrsso , i obviously like this game . just i see room improvement adding or subtracting = taking middle , i feel designers weakend overall experiencebtw , fable 2 works ( ... xbox ) = i hope they don't go crazy system requirements once it comes pc . afterall , how much better game look = fable tlc " easy eyes " !. i found myself just wandering looking first few plays	-1
i've this headset month half so far things working good . it little staticky but price 25 bucks you cant really go wrong . if it comes down little static or restricted lame cord , then i'd rather endure little static . battery life probaly little over 4 hrs which pretty good size unit . miscomfort other reviewers wrote isnt really bad they've made it sound . once again it little unconfortable long length time ( 3 hrs +) or maybe little less others but i dont think i've worn any kind ear piece very comfortable regardless what it designed ( cell phone , xbox , ect . ) one thing keep mind before you purchase , manufacture logitech so i felt good reliability produc t.t acoma	-1
valkyrie profile cult classic . no matter how you look it . it one those games you either loved or hated . obviously enough people loved it enough square-enix re-release original psp make second one playstation 2 . end result great game should satisfy fans original . despite what it looks like , valkyrie profile 2 : silmeria not sequel valkyrie profile but prequel . this means if you've never played first one , fear not , you aren't missing anything . story centers silmeria . she valkyrie trapped body princess alicia . because this it seems like alicia split personality , she got crazy or something . result , alice doesn't very many friends ... if any all . silmeria , exiled odin , leader gods . she now wants revenge what he her , since alice no friends , she agrees help . it interesting story , but much like first one , gets off really slow start takes while pick up . game story told through beautiful cinematics not quite best looking game ps2 , but beautiful enough . backgrounds , characters monsters all detailed . especially some games cutscenes . voice acting also suitable enough game . game also sounds really good . good news valkyrie profile 2 there no time limit . fans first remember there time limit before battle end game . valkyrie profile 2 away thank goodness it . this gives you far more time explore everything game offer , dungeons quite interesting . most dungeons pretty simple . it sort plays out action/adventure style . you photons you fire your enemies certain objects . your photon also reflects off some objects , it actually vital use this some dungeons . so photon isn't just there , it essential . even more interesting valkyrie profile battle system . battles contact based . battle you've got your characters one side your enemies other . first it seems like battles take place real time , but reality , enemy only moves when you move . this gives you more than enough time plan out strategy . each enemy attack zone . if you're it , you'll attacked . most rpgs getting attacked no big deal . valkyrie profile 2 it much more than just big deal . difficulty this game escalates really fast . you'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed some your enemies . luckily there solution . most battles leader . if you defeat leader you win automatically without worry defeating others . it helps if you want end battle quickly , especially helps when your party decimated . still , battle system calls complete strategy your part . they say it takes 40 hours complete valkyrie profile 2 . however , you'll find yourself spending most these hours leveling up take new challenges . i mentioned , difficulty level rises fast . meaning you'll probably lot battling dungeon before moving next . even worse , you'll backtrack out dungeon once you complete it . even worse than , enemies respawn when you reenter room . good thing this least , dungeons aren't overly long . again , however , you'll spend quite some time leveling up . addition inside battle , outside battle just interesting dungeons . you'll often come across sealstones . when you pick them up they grant enhancements your party . they either positive or negative . example your strength could go up grabbing one ... go down grabbing . carrying it puts effect your party . however , you also put effect your enemies setting stone dais . needless say , you'll want put negative effects your enemies ... unless you're looking harder challenge than game already . outside dungeons battles you learn plenty skills throughout game . when you buy equipment , you link it together give your characters special skills . this lot fun play around . although , it should said , it gets tedious set it up after while . game shows you which skills you've created through your equipment , but there no way it auto-equip stuff gives you skill . first this no problem , but then your characters start build up your list gets longer , it becomes pain set up all these skills again . it comes down way too much time menu when there shouldn't . valkyrie profile 2 overall pretty satisfying game . if you get past sluggish story ( which really turn out really good end ) then you'll find yourself love this game . it different first one , but not so much old fans find themselves disappointed . actually it quite opposite . if you liked first game , then all means , pick up this one . good+an interesting story+beautiful graphics+excellent music score+good voice acting+large cast playable characters+interesting skill system+just all out fun playthe bad-the story slow-really steep difficulty level , lot game no doubt come you spending time leveling up dungeons before moving on-the skill system interesting , but not able your equipment auto-equip really annoying when you've got lot characters lot items your inventory -- equipping your characters shouldn't tedious chor	1

i still remember getting this game 9/9/99 , day it came out . i love this game because it junction system some other cool features this game . unfortunatly , all people i knew , people either hated game ( most those people this side love/hate group ) few people loved it ( extremly hardcore rpg fans seem love it . ) . i love game but this final fantasy game whole lot people just can't stand . it long game , especially if you get stuck , so guide ( internet or actual guide i don't care ) really help . it easiest game literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you level up but using junction system also important role game because it raise your stats well . this game you play yourself . before you agree haters , give it spin , please	1
" katamari damacy " one best games ever made . it also freshest game . don't let kiddie theme deter you : this extremely playable anyone . music very good genre recordings ; some them accoustic jazz studio recordings japanese , but jazz sound there , especially " gin tonic red red roses , " which noir-ish 15-minute scat vocal swing track percussion , piano , double bass , flute . game two-player mode , which set arena competition see who better . one-player mode story-driven mode king cosmos father your protagonist who little green guy looks similar teletubby . objective use two analog sticks make character push around small ball inside garden or rooms house , or both , into objects normally found those three-dimensional environments , such pairs scissors , mice , golf balls , flowers , paperclips , dining chairs , spoons , anything everything . rolling ball snowball effect , which means more things your character rolls up into ball , larger ball becomes . there big transition moment game where , after rolling ball around rooms house , character breaks out house down driveway farmer market other side street where he starts rolling watermelons until ball gets even larger rolls bicycles , little kids then adults . game play surreal fantasy , but it all comes together its finale abstract epiphany world small enough place understand each other when replacing unnecessary meaningful . more i played this game , hungrier i got , ending surprised me epiphany . it namco who , you know , japanese company produced original pac-man arcade game . since then , it produced several genre games sony playstation including soul edge series , soul blade soul calibur , tekken series , ridge racer/rage racer series , ace combat/air combat series , all which prime landmarks console history . this game so fresh , it struck blow me . strangely , it one those japanese releases almost didn't make it over america . when it brand new , its list price only $20 ; most games $50 upon release . raving critical success " sleeper hit " popularity this game garnered sequel , but i haven't played it yet . any rate , it just may continue one namco great series if it maintains inertia this original one	1

i've seen people love this game hate this game , either there not star wars fan or they hate battle system . i myself love star wars battle sysetm this game . battle system simple yet fun same time . you however many party members you attack then your enemy attacks . first you hate it or think it slow but game progresses you get many mmore attacks defenses get more involved . music star wars . new old music everyone love . story someone said their review worthy script film . story what won this game awards . it also completely changes weather you follow dark or ligh t.t he characters your you come love you talk them whenever they large wealth background info uncover . voice acting also well put together ingages you more down path realism . i would overall rate this game 9.7 out 10when adding flaws good side . this would my top 3 games all time . pros- engaging very great story . - great voice work- splended music- star wars fans fall love- large explorable worlds- great combat , many weapons custamizable weapons . - long story , game ranges 20 - 35 hours long . { it took me 26 my first time my longest 33 - depending all side missions you do}cons- graphics most time fuzzy { unless your playing it 360 } . - very , very , very slow load times- i beat game 12 times , 5 dark , 7 light after you played through story both sides least twice { 4 total } it get old after you know story . - people say it freezes often , mine hasn't ever but framerate slowed down during large battle . overall , i hope my review helpfull i believe game $20 now thats great game this good	1
i said first game kotor 2 still one best rgp games xbox . bew story close episode 3 movies . jedi shamble sith power . but you last jedi . so they thought . you find some familier faces first game . like master vrook , tmo4 , revans battle droid , bastila , carth , thats it . only droids your party though . what new game you influence your party members . so you bring them light or dark . but warned ... if your going get them yopur side you things they think right . some charitable acts influence some but others want brute force . also you influence them when your talking them . influenceing them pay off . getting them trust you more they tell you things . this also bring more force points ect . this one other then first you train some members you party becom jedi or sith . depend your path . also new classes changed . path light 3 classes . jedi master gives you better influence you rparty members more force power . also give party members stronger using force points . advised it onlys last limited amount time . jedi weapons master lets you upgrade your 2 weapons fighting upgrades other fighting states . jedi watchmen stealth types . sith marauder enter afury inflicting more damage then before . it almost like jedi weapons master buy better . sith lord just same but weaken you foes using force points . i can't rember what other one but its same jedi watchmen . sith lords sheer amazing . one cracks through all his body because he thrives pain . other leeches planets feed his hunger force . last one surprise . well game great twists perfect must like other .	1
i feel romantic , driving through city rain moon view , emotion dial . i'm ashamed admit i spend most my evenings helping coppers chase down wannabe front mall , 50 bucks pop citizen arrest i just keep kicking em while they're down , cha-ching ! i've bought all properties just results my do-gooder vigilantism . see , this game rewards higher sense morality	1
this game fun , especially if you twitch gamer who few anger issues ( me ) . game basically suped up duck hunt but i don't know why it so much fun . story mode great fun finished manner hours if you good , challenge mode very challenging , unlockable crisis mode probably most fun i ever sniping my entire life , top it all off , if you guncon ... you say multiplayer . also , if you aren't aquainted time crisis but other light gun games there one biiiiiig difference . instead desperately plugging everything moves preying you get it before it gets you , you hit one buttons guncon ( or release , depending your control style)and take cover behind object nearby . but every game ... there drawbacks . one , if you don't guncon don't money version w/ guncon then you play awkward blue reticle incredibly slow . if you larger tv then you cannot hit enemies sides ( least , i couldn't ) . you calibrate darn guncon every time you boot up game if you calibrate it wrong then you reset ps2 try again . graphics aren't best earth . storyline wierd hard follow ( but no where near bad kingdom hearts , sheesh !!! ) . there incredibly tedious hookup process . if you smaller tv ... let just say you gonna three inches away screen spot some enemies . plus multiplayer split screen tiny , very very tiny if you want play like arcade , you need ps2 serial link cable(from what i've seen you cannot link two ps2s via network adapter , sowwy ) two guncons , two tvs , two ps2s , two copies time crisis 3 . if you ain't got dough you ain't gonna go ! although it seems like bad outweighs good , there just something nailing terrorists right head stream lead just feels oh so good . this deserves definate 5 out 5	1
even though other people doubt gameplay this game , it still cool . yeah it should quot ; leashed . quot ; well i don't care what he says , i'm afl fan i say this deserves 5 golden stars . go red dogs	1
people pick rockstar group their grand theft auto series , but i actually found bully game much more redeeming . you're schoolboy taking stereotypical cliques . it pretty clear why you're depressed teenage boy when game starts . apparently your dad died , your mom remarried elderly , grumpy old man who wants you out picture . your mom more than happy dump you off stay-all-year school while she goes off mr. moneybucks . top , school officials pretty nasty you right start . hogwarts this not ! then you go into run-down dorm , other kids start beating up you ! it time you stand up yourself make stand . there various groups kids this school - nerds , jocks , greasers preppies . activities you raise or lower your respect level each group . you go class too - there time ! if you're able manage your schedule properly , you participate some pretty fun mini-games ( word scramble challenging ! ) earn you new skills . there girls court , usually they want specific item . so you numerous quests go . bully activities range escorting nerd safely his locker , running races protecting yourself attacks . you get clothing way , customize your look ( within school regulations , course ) . it bit depressing , sometimes , see how these mid-teen guys treat each other , but this actually happen many schools . i'm sure pretty much every person who once teen name cliques existed their school . graphics rather good ps2 , sounds , while again bit depressing teen environment , work well game too . one hand i not really like swearing game , but certain teens fact swear far worse than this game ! i'd even say this more like fable than other grand theft autos , some ways you choose how you react situations . this game won't enjoyed people who squeamish violence - it , after all , involve teen guys all bashing each other very inane reasons . it also involves lot bullying - you might imagine . still , if you deal those issues , you'll find really involving game might actually make you think how treat others well	1

truth these memory cards not all much space them , so you certainly want buy two ... i've made thousands saves these cards only ever one go corrupt so say these cards work extremely well understatement . plus , they come variety different colors . there many cheaper memory cards made various manufacturers , but almost all them seem issues some variety , some problems where data magically disappears , some issues saves failing , just avoid hassle altogether . cost/value ratio may seem poor first but just surf around web find 2 29.99 , you won't regret it long run	1

it used ( it couple years since i bought computer game new ) long your pc not too old , you could run any game it . no so oblivion ( some other new games i believe ) . run oblivion ( ) you need machine high end graphics card . so unless you bought pc specifically gaming , or specifically updated graphics card , oblivion just quit after intro screen , without telling you why ! while i readily accept not high end graphics card mean games not look good , it frustrating this game not even run my pc ( dual core , 1g ram ) . no , it still not run if you install manufacturer patch . however all not completely lost . i able install " oldblivion " ( just google it find site ) patch oldblivion site now it runs acceptably . oldblivion other patch graphics still pretty good ( better than morrowind though understandably not nearly good screenshots online ) , however it tends crash every so often ( its unclear whether or not this due graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs game ) . nonetheless , if high end graphics card , or patience apply all unofficial online patches , game pretty cool . i not big fan morrowind , but oblivion number improvements over morrowind ( my opinion ): 1 ) you fast travel ( just open up map click ) all cities any sites you before . even when you cannot fast travel new place , you usually walk nearly straight line there ( morrowind it maddening go someplace since i often would end up running into mountains i could not climb)2 ) oblivion not so dark gloomy , like morrowind ! 3 ) npc speak ( this me huge benefit , morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would through pages text dialouge -- if i wanted read i would pick up book , not play computer game ! )4 ) there quest arrow points towards person you need see . morrowind it incredibly tedious track people down ! 5 ) finally minor point , names people not look like programmers mashed hand keyboard ( morrowind there quests like " go see erajgukadfhs ask sakdfhslkdjf " . i just don't need when i am playing computer game ! one thing i not care oblivion way monsters level you . first character i , i got up level 15 found myself beaten up goblins ! unless you powergame ( stragically plan your leveling maximize stats combat skills ) or turn difficulty way down , leveling monsters makes game real pain -- combat related quests ( such painted trolls ) should not get harder more you level . all all it pretty fun game , but before you buy , make sure you high end graphics card ( or lot patience) !	-1
if you rpg bone your body , back days paper rpg who didnt dream game where you could roam creepy tombs fighting undead , finding magic loot , avoiding traps , all near cartoon quality graphics .. thats game we all wanted . now finally i believe this first game fufills all aspects what all rpg'ers envisioned game . world free-form , enemy creatures well animated pose challenge combat , all characters dialogue real speech . theres strong challenging main quest complete . well you take your character many twists turns . want professional thief , you it . want murderer hits , you . ( shame you ) . want good guy help out people you . gameworld itself massive , you trapse across gorgeous(and sometimes dangerous ) countryside , crossing rivers , mountains , grassy plains . seasons change stars light up night , it really graphically amazing . thats where it pays top line pc , graphics amazing so you better current system . you get say athlon 3000xp 9800pro but part prices so cheap why would you want ? not doom3 , not halflife 2 , not prey , this game thats pressing people upgrade their machine . athlon 64 16 pipe 256mb graphics cards fairly cheap i'd say its worth upgrading just play this game . i athlon 64 4000 256mb x800xl i run game 1024x768 high detail . game ran well but some outdoor locations combat when things got busy it would slow down bit , so i dialed back draw distance bit plant draw distance now everything almost always very smooth . ( i think plant draw distance one easiest things dial back get more fps without sacrificing visual quality ) . i really cant this game justice review , i am loss words fully convey this games greatness . however i say if you even tiny love paper or computer rpgs this game you . if you enjoy final fantasy type games freedom this game bowl you over . if you like idea free form fantasy world you want get this . fact i hard time imagining anyone proper computer run this game not liking it . though if i imagine someone who wouldnt its someone who hates stories , cant bothered dialogue simply wants blast things hours . but they doom 3 so they're happy too .	1

other than r-type snes , i've never really played muuch else terms series . however , i'm glad say i purchased this one ps2 . graphics control aside , i think it game mechanics which make this such fun game . basics original essentially same ; you fly ship around , blastng your way through hordes enemies endless assault lasers obstacles . however , what set this baby apart rest your weapon system . you attachable bit front your ship which released , allowing you place it front or back your ship , or just let it roam . this means you fire behind you . pretty cool . plus , bit itself absorbs most bullets , so it used shield , which after absorbing enough energy , allows you unleash large explosing-type shot . coupled charged shots , customizable bits missiles , there lot room technique . plus , there 101 different ships you you use , each their own weapons systems bit missile selections ( which surprisingly unique ) so you won't run into problems redundancy . other than difficulty sometimes slow pacing game , ( not mention slow-down issue times)this must buy all shooter fans . highly recommended	1

i firstly say i am not pre-teen average age range gamecube , but i still like this controller . when i first saw it , i thought it would too small my hands , button placement looked awkward . i couldn't more wrong . controller fits comfortably , even into my larger than average hands ( xbox , i prefer bigger , older controller smaller controller ) all buttons within easy reach . controller set up way controlls very instinctive most games . it also allows you roll your thumb button button , allowing smoother gameplay than systems where you lift your thumb press buttons . shoulder buttons controller sensitive degree they pushed , allowing more versatile controlls than ps2 shooters , racing games , few others . control stick comfortable precise . c-stick usually superb , but few third party games i found it awkward . because it not same size shape most control sticks , it awkward using it one . c-stick , however , performs admirably madden , where i find it preferable xbox ps2 controllers . only quality issue i found gamecube c-stick . if you tend slam your controllers ground , or leave them sat , etc , stick sometimes breaks , so system thinks you always pushing it upwards . overall , very comfortable easy use controller . high quality manufacturing , one glitch	1
when i first went shopping second controller my gamecube , i admit i looking one matched my platinum edition controller . i couldn't find one wasn't wavebird ( nothing wrong wavebird - wireless controller - i know , but i just too cheap spend extra $10 ) . so i bought black controller match my tv . now i think it , buying different controller smart thing . why didn't i plan first place ? i spent part winter battling cold or flu various times , i can't underestimate importance controlling spread viruses bacteria . different-colored controllers makes it easier remember which controller i've using nose-blowing sessions . when housemate or friend wants play gamecube i lay suffering other couch , i am able croak out words " use black one today . trust me . " i also phobia against third-party hardware - so it good nintendo ( not mention profitable nintendo ) sell spare parts . most important things controller : it fit comfortably your hand , buttons easy find use ? only thing i don't like placement button . cord plenty long , buttons responsive enough . i also like they're color-coded	1

there numerous trends video gaming industry nowadays . those developers sure become sophisticated . one tactics release " classic games " their consoles see if they re-milk market . this , course , come mixed reviews mixed successes . final fantasy iv game boy advance champion game . compared super nintendo entertainment system ( snes ) version ( ff2 ) , i believe this re-make slightly better due increased/updated features game . ( squaresoft retooled some aspects game added some nice features please classic rpg enthusiasts well diehard final fantasy fans . ) i like think ff4gba " upgraded " version original program - similar downloading patch pc game , only , course , it still remains console game . major stand-out benefit i gathered this version game now gameplay flows smoother into final fantasy iii version . ( ff6 you diehards know japanese nomenclature . ) , switching party members - introduced " ff3 . " also , unlocking feature where optional side quests result more loot ! last part this review deals most important topic : cost-benefit analysis . question , you want enroll this common tactic video gaming industry ? $30 worth snes ff2 " patch ? " portable version game ( albeit great game ) meet your desires ? probably most us , we got rid our old nes snes long time ago . ( i didn't - they right next my n64 gamecube . ) lot us downloaded emulators while back now play these games our pcs . i would venture say almost all us who love rpgs don't even care video game consoles anymore gone pc ( more features our games ) . so my recommendation here , leave your impulses behind . yes , final fantasy ii ( ff4 gba version ) classic , great , wonderful games . but nostalgia shouldn't cost this much or require special circumstances taken advantage , my opinion . buy game if you collector or money burn . but always remember , they can't take our memories away	1
we near end life span last generation consoles , key franchises appeared year after year begin wrap up their yearly development cycle . crazy it may sound , madden nfl 07 could one last times we see madden xbox , playstation 2 , or gamecube . mind , it not altogether surprising madden 07 doesn't really push envelope terribly far . game includes few new control features some mode tweaks ( nearly all which also available xbox 360 version this year game ) , but most part , it feels like result series pushed far it possibly go given platform , you definitely get sense madden current-generation consoles beginning wind down . however , least this last year , veteran player outraces up-and-comer xbox 360 version , there certainly enough compelling reasons check this year game out older consoles . madden nfl 07 brings back practically every feature madden 06 . top , number new gameplay upgrades brought table , majority which available all versions game . themselves , none these individual changes or upgrades particularly game changing , but taken whole , they add nice dimension depth . these features include highlight stick , new kick meter , lead blocking controls . highlight stick new version truck stick used runners offense . here , you use right control stick pull off sorts crazy jukes steps star running backs so well known , top , depending type back you're playing , you opt use more-powerful moves , or more finesse-based maneuvers . this feels like natural evolution last year truck stick , though most experienced madden players able get just easily using button-based moves rather than making liberal use stick . but if you take time learn stick figure out how use it button controls together , you very hard runner stop . new lead blocking controls likely inspire some new tactics all types players . here , while offense , you opt switch your controlled player any available blockers during running play . this includes offensive linemen , tight ends , fullbacks , or whoever else might blocking play . when blocking , you just standard blocks , or you even get dirty some mean-spirited cut blocks . this interesting mechanic , because it stops you rely cpu blockers , which any experienced player tell you , not always most reliable players field . you also quickly switch back control running back once you've laid down your block , which good , because cpu running back doesn't always manage find holes you're creating . first , you may find yourself unable effectively use this feature , setting up right blocks isn't always most intuitive thing world . but after some time , this control method gives running game really interesting new perspective , those who love finding new strategies bound eat this up . new kick meter probably most accurate representation kicking available game thus far . this meter , you use typical arrow line up your angle then press down right analog stick set up your power . meter quickly fills up , then you press forward right stick set power well your accuracy . accuracy based angle which you press up . if you press too far right or left , kick get away you . if you land it within set space , it go pretty much right where you want it . beyond , changes 06 07 mostly ancillary , fundamentally , game plays very much its predecessor . defense , there few more available options terms positioning your defensive players , you commit your defense certain direction moment ball snapped . offense , quarterback vision cone , which made its debut last year , still available , though it not required feature . you just tap right analog stick after snapping ball , it pop , letting you use it little accuracy boost . no , it not any more fun use than it last year , but that not altogether surprising . otherwise , pretty much every control feature you've come expect madden front center once again . potentially , some people could play through madden 07 never really partake new running control features , but there definitely enough all available upgrades add significant layer depth experience . even though madden nfl 07 doesn't any big , game-changing features make it especially memorable iteration series , its roster small , but useful changes ultimately more compelling than anything madden 06 offer last year . while some people undoubtedly over notion playing new games old consoles , madden 07 shows it still deliver some enjoyable football , regardless what platform it . it not big step forward , similarities this year last year might tough sell some . but it those similar aspects madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor , if you skipped out 06 , then there no good reason ignore 07 .	1

our whole family plays this game ! we fell love first katamari game , but it frustrating trying complete each subsequently harder level . this game isn't like . each level different its own right . some levels require you roll faster , some bigger , some them you gather many certain item you find . it challenging without frustration . you always go back try better each level , find cousin or present hidden ... or you continue . there two player mode also . it much more fun than first katamari . course if you don't know premise first game you might not understand king common peoples ' rantings ... but it simple enough . roll around get big your sticky ball . it addictive	1
thought first katamari game addictive ? this one worse . it just like other , only you more levels different types ' quests , ' like cleaning up room rolling up 1000 cranes help out friend who sick . one best parts you play any cousin you found level , there dozens more royal presents . fact , you wear 2 once ! king still hilarious . fact , every time you beat major level , you get short little cut scene his past . you even get hear him speak ( japanese ) end . huge treat me . many people complain graphics . i think simple , blocky graphics greatly suits game . it would lose its charm if graphics good newer final fantasy game . bright colors , funky sound even funkier music just make this game adoreable while making you uttering over over again " what world ...? " there only two complaints i ... multiplayer length game . multiplayer still lacking ; there aren't many levels choose it get little old after while . also , game relatively short . i beat it within 3 days playing it maybe 2-3 hours day . however , this easily combatted side quests . you still find all royal presents ( sometimes there more than one level ) , cousins ( 39 all ; there 4 you find one last levels ) , 3 extra levels you obtain after you ' beat game . ' ending credits even level . this why it loses one star ... it really more 4.5 star . conclusion , we love katamari great game . it'll you hooked . i reccomend it anyone who hold controller . that only skill you need play it . :) sense creativity , course	1

this review going based 3 categories . good , bad , ugly . good : eye inspiring graphics special effects . very impressive nightmaresh sound effects . very scarey game lots lots heart stopping surprises . game you either jumping out your seat or shooting up anything moves or falls floor . bad : game lacks lot original doom series . over half original creatures doom 1 , 2 , final doom missing which very disappointing . sound track creatures not resemble anything next original doom series except rocket-launching revenant archvile . id software must spent lot time designing those two , unfortunently , they forgot add rest creatures . imp , i didn't clue what those tall creatures 8 eight eyes , throwing fire balls me . i didn't know what they until i downloaded it my pda game . what disappointment ! lot times while i playing game , it seemed if i play quake 2 or half-life but not doom . don't get me wrong game . game good game but they should named it doom ( beginning ) instead doom 3 . ugly : no joystick or game pad support . only controller support keyboard mouse which cause your left hand get carpartunnel constantly pressing tab , shift , , , , , , keys . game way too dark . lot times , you're shooting open air , then turning flash light see if they're dead or still walking around , only find out they're behind you tearing you pieces . i heard lot people stating game caused their computers slow down crawl . i myself didn't problem . my computer 3 years old what even worse i'm running video card 6 years old . my system amd xp 2800+ over clocked equal amd xp 3200+ , 640mb ram , diamond monster sound 300mx old 3dfx voodoo 5500 64mb video ram . it took me awhile find right driver combination my voodoo card because 3dfx went out business back december 2000 . but anyway , under timedemo it states i get 19 fps but under actual game play i get 38 fps high quality mode resolution 1024x768 . go figure ! i can't use ultra high quality mode because my voodoo card doesn't support tnl ( transform lighting ) i can't tell difference high quality ultra high quality except ultra hight quality runs slower . by-the-way . my video card sound card not direct 9.0 compliant so don't believe everything you read system requirements	-1

bottom controller sticks out quite bit , but this not affect gameplay other than it same size regular gamecube controller . simply fantastic ( unless you're one those people just need rumble some reason ) . but one slight problem : it just me , or trigger buttons occasionally fail ? example , resident evil 4 , i'll holding button aim , but it quickly go back forth normal view , if button cancels out . however , this rare , maybe it just me . once again , excellent high-quality controller	1

ok so .. it really ticks me off know i'm near thirty 8 year old kid could probably destroy me games like this .. but friend mine bought me this game christmas due my obsession rabbits .. i fell love .. first tutorial level where you catch over hundred rabbits your bun gun i hooked ... like lab rabbit needing crack i hooked ! i actually beaten this game over month or so later .. but still tons missions left complete .. many new video games it set up percentages instead levels though there i guess we talk old school .... there different worlds you visit but so many missions slowly raise percentage .. so i guess you could find certain missions defeat just hurry up beat game .... but missions makes it more satisfying ... this games make me so mad i see red trying beat certain missions but other missions breeze ... but that what i love game actually challenges me .. gives me something work towards .. when you finally beat mission you really feel like you've something .. graphics amazing .. i highly suggest if you liked movie get this game .. or if you liked spongebob squarepants games such battle bikini bottom , movie flying dutchman you should get this game .. it even better dare i say !	1

pros : 1 . storyline very detailed . there lot twists turns . i'm not going spoil it ... find out yourself :) 2 . weapons very nice . everything classic crowbar ( yay ! ) gravity gun preform very well . you damage just anything environment use it your advantage . 3 . physics amazing . water rippling things flying through air all very well . makes you get real sense game . 4 . a.i. challenging varified . also different weapons work better some than others so it fun experiment . 5 . there no really specific road follow this game . you explore find secret compartments stuff . 6 . there actually bunch little thinkers this game . order get somewhere , like sewage tunnel or over fence , you may something first , such flip switch or put something somewhere . gives you challenge . 7 . saving nice . you save anywhere game . so if you lose , you'll just go back you last checkpoint . cons : 1 . it loads lot . if you xbox w/ lot games it it might load slower . i'm not positive though . it runs pretty good mine but yeah , there quite lot point loading . ( but game itself makes up it ) i rated half-life 2 4/5 stars b/c it very good game . it very accurate it gameplay , making it challenging fun . plus who can't resist playing baseball headcrabs .	1
my opinion yes . anyone who heard this game but doesn't fast enough computer run it ( case me ) should buy this game . gameplay inspired . there only one section midway through game where i felt transition mouse keyboard console control pad hurt game . outside one complaint graphics amazing ( xbox ) . sound design girpping atmospheric music wafts out . characters interesting well acted . everything this game top notch . anyone who says halo 2 better game quite simply idiot . halo obviously better multiplayer ( this game none ) but outside there simply nothing xbox comes close single player experience . awesome , awesome game	1

besides baldur gate ii , icewide dale second most fun crpg game out there . more action than role playing , which fine me . this single-player multi-character game , you get create entire party 6 adventures . plot fairly weak , but action plentiful i love fact you get develop 6 different characters . if you get just one icewind dale games , get icewind dale ii . character generation development much better ( not mention gameplay graphics )	1
i've decided buy this collection after reading lot reviews different websites . but none them very clear contents package , so here contents package 1 . icewind dale ( 2 cd's)2 . icewind dale expansion heart winter ( 1cd)3 . icewind dale ii ( 2 cd's)4 . icewind dale soundtrack5 . icewind dale ii bonus disk6 . icewind dale strategy guides , trailer iwd iithis package well worth purchase , u get series one best selling game , developed pioneers who also developed games like fallout series , bg1 abd bg2 . graphics great , they look bright crisp . soundtrack great suits well ambience , u really feel snow falling cold weather . gameplay fun , it more like hack slash game , i'm greatest fan diablo series , so i love this game well . put it nut shell , this game hack slash dd rules . if u like diablo u certainly like this . baldurs gate fans slightly get disappointed game play . charecter creation great , this game allows dual class charecters , so it adds more fun gameplay . my only complaint , there no interation within party members , but this doesn't affect gameplay experience . overall if u ever thought getting this game don't know whether its worth money , answer plainly , best value money	1

after playing big three b-ball games ' 06 ( nba live , nba 2k6 , nba ' 06 : life ) , reading reviews posted here each , i'm still not convinced much anything , other than makers these games got bunch our hard-earned dollars giving us very little far quality gaming . wit : 1 . nba live ' 06 - this series should fantastic , but seems keep taking major steps backwards every new release . horrible graphics , annoying bugs ( crash ! crash ! crash ! ) , inferior gameplay nothing new under sun . heck , instead extra like 2k6 street ball , all we've got included here lame ' retro ' live version , what ? ten years ago ? c'mon . anybody even going play this ? compare ea nba franchise their innovative exciting madden series ... not even close . i know pro football brings big bucks , nba barely close second , but ... maybe ea needs switch their development teams around next years installments ... 2 . nba ' 06 : life - ugh . nice idea , absolutely horrible , awful , crappy execution . everything other than premise garbage . speaking ... instead buying this stinker , i should've just tossed my money garbage . i can't even trade it - none secondhand dealers around pdx want take it . 3 . nba 2k6 : now here , i hope . game includes pretty much all nifty stuff i want out basketball sim , but overall package still somewhat lacking . interface not very user friendly , overall graphics look like they lifted five-year old product . i create player , but how i get player onto roster ? no clue . menu doesn't give me hint , i've pressed every button i think , no results , ' instruction ' book no help here . why , once i create player ( roster portion main menu ) , can't i use player 24/7 section game ? why i spend more time doing it all over again ? sorry guys , but player graphics game just okay ( players cutaways look like they're made out rubber , detail actual games lousy - courts nba live much more realistic , although fans here perform like , well , fans -- especially during cut sequences after ref whistle stop play ... they celebrate high five , boo bad calls , etc . courts menu graphics , however , look like something , well game five or six years ago . actual basketball ..., even though play bit more realistic than nba live , it still only adequate , using right joystick shot control worse than making guess . however ... twenty bucks , it cheapest bunch , so i didn't feel like i investing fake diamond mine africa . there so many nifty options keep this game fresh , deep sim-franchise mode 24/7 streetball mode , average gamer should happy just playing ball , rest us who've played our fair share b-ball keep some interest after dunking our way through couple seasons . i like there stats like crazy , there total control in-depth franchise simulation right down last details ( like creating your franchise gm , building custom franchise , or designing your players shoes ) , computer controlled players actually something games play like their real-life counterparts ( big men claim rebounds ! ) i love i tie up opposing teams ball-handler , ref actually call jump balls ... although i win tip , but not claim ball after ...?! commentary may best ever b-ball sim ( whatever you need keep kenny smith board this project ) rarely repetitive . i like replay player cutaways during game , crazy enough , i've missing actual halftime show ( nba live ) , instead just getting menu stats ( remember when ea used real dancer photo during halftime ? liked lot , but guess i'll take silly animated cheerleaders here instead ) . all all , i'd say this toss up two big boys . since i've played nba live franchise so long , i'd hope see ea take lesson 2k6 , make jump this level gaming simulation , then step or two further . or flip side -- 2k6 incorporate stuff ea right improve it . then maybe we'll finally basketball simulation worth twenty , or thirty , or fifty bucks we fans keep shelling out year after year ..	-1

first off , lemme just say i am nintendo fan , i since i first got nes system [ ... ] years old 1988 . i every nintendo home console since then loved it . i bought gc 2002 really fell love it . i eventually traded it my brother computer ... dumb move . years later i bought one used friend but never played it b/c school sold it . well its 2006 i am buying gamecube today b/c i miss it so much even after getting into pc games like world warcraft half-life . here why : 1 ) system : it flawless . i never seen this system lock up or malfunction , it reads every disk fine . i clearly plays many multiplatform games such resident evil 4 timesplitters 2 best . i like ps/2 games but console itself crap few good games console doesn't really give me enough reason keep rebuy one b/c they crap out . xbox good system , but games nothing you can't really ps/2 besides halo kotor . 2 ) games : sure there lot kid games this system . but there many teen mature games too . many available but aren't obvious find . what so amazing games not only truely wonderful one like metroid prime , zelda , mario , re4 , etc . but all great games nobody ever really plays much . you find many these games gc they cheap probably more fun than most games you ever play any other console . some these include : eternal darknessdie hard vendetta(wow , i loved this game ... there zero advertising it i know of)killer 7agent under fire(not underground necessarily but this game amazing)phantasy star online 1 2soul caliber 2etc . if you really into first person shooters , don't even bother xbox . play pc games , they better graphically seem easier handle keyboard my opinion . if you want load fighting games like tekken or street fighter , ps/2 good but like i said , system really horrible designed , even new slimlines problems . honestly i would pick up ps/1 ebay if you wanna play some great fighters like tekken or king fighters . if you want best gameplay out games great price get gamecube . i'm telling you , i know what your thinking . you walk into video store , see pikmin or super mario sunshine gamecube think ... psh what am i [ ... ] years old ? looks deceiving , this system amazing all games , honestly pikmin me rolling ground it so oddball fun . i give gamecube easily 5 stars , it never let me down what it meant , great games	1
mr. craig clotfelter wrote review earlier matches my sentiments exactly . if you get used ' controls ' get early slowness , this excellent game . i havent beaten it yet havent played it month or so [ computor went down ] . you main quest straight or wander around building your character up , i personally didnt start main till i level 13 even then took it slow easy . you progress game , ar wander area , new towns open up i just sort got new side quests these areas opened up . so i am taking my time . it great game . if you buy it , patience , you wont regret it	1
part elder scrolls series , morrowind takes live action adventure games like zelda series overlays it more traditional role playing stat system ala dungeons dragons . elaborate , player freely explore expansive 3d world first person or third person mode , while practicing improving their character skill set . combat , example , rather than trying work your way through menu system trying cast magic use attack moves etc . ( final fantasy anyone ? ) , player must physically aim swing sword or fire spell his opponent . whether or not bow lands based things like player agility bad guy block skill . thus , unlike game such , say , fable , action doesn't depend much player own reflexes dexterity . little common sense caution goes long way . also , don't expect lots elaborate , teary-eyed cut scenes like story-driven games such final fantasy . real draw this game complete freedom player whoever they want , go anywhere they like , almost anything ( within reason ) . player asked choose name , race , gender , face hairstyle their character , also create basic skill set use ( any combination combat , magical , stealth categories ) . then player given some simple instructions beginning first task main quest simply released into massive world towns , people , wilderness . there main quest follow , but gameplay completely open-ended . it easy become completely distracted caught up endless guild quests random adventures await your character . personally , i've playing this game two half years now , i've still not accomplished everything there this game . i'm not sure i even describe depth this game this review . i've literally spent hours just trying different clothes armor , creating my own spells potions , or reading books ( both factual fictional ) game libraries ( i'd like add almost anything read book found or game ) . i've also spent literally days gameplay searching various legendary unique artifacts trying uncover various mysteries game , such solving disappearance dwarves , finding cure vampirism , locating ( or becoming ) werewolf , how become necromancer ( some which i've found or am close finding ) . i've played most ( if not all ) zelda games , i've played fable , i've played games like dragon warrior final fantasy , i've even played text rpg like adom . they all their good points advantages ( i've greatly enjoyed them all ) , but none them ( not even majora mask ) held my attention this long . elder scrolls iii : morrowind best role playing game i've ever played maybe ( just maybe ) best game i've ever played overall	1
thug 2 came out last year pretty popular game . what i liked game how they included older levels updated graphics . game doesn't last long ; you easily beat it , but if you're huge fan you still play hours end even after it beaten . you play online , too , which lot fun i think it adds excellence this game more so . thps or thug fan ? buy this	-1

ffvi end-all best game ever created . story line simply out this world . game grips you beginning never lets go . interaction main characters incredible . game creates most haunting mood any game ever released , despite now primitive graphics sound . i gone years without playing game before but story , environments , villains even some music would still stand out my mind . this game simply leaves impression you unlike any other video game ever could . after playing through it , every other game out there just seems void content . no other final fantasy installment touch this one ( ffvii distant second ) . this likely remain best game ever created unless it completely remade today technology , but even questionable snes graphics give incredible atmosphere game anyway . my only complaint this particular title result its adaption playstation . new cinema cut scenes not come even remotely close doing this game justice . some sound didn't carry over well either , addition load times isn't exactly welcome one . despite these shortcomings , it still complete game , which all matters . ffvi absolutely breathtaking every aspect when it released , remains so this day . story , music , characters gameplay still better than anything today games offer . anyone who yet experience this incredible adventure only keeping themselves one most engaging stories ever	1
what happened clue chronicles ? first off , you may notice couple things : 1 . this called clue chronicles 2 . it refered episode 1 sometimes . 3 . it 1999 game no sequelwhy this ? well , clue chronicles hasbro interactive eai . eai quit gaming business hasbro quit computer games left board games . so , promising series " doomed . " if you enjoy this game , i advise you write into atari . why atari ? well , hasbro left all their computer games . they passed all rights infogrames , which became atari . so , complicated confusing clue chronicles timeline , rights held atari . i , if you like game you should too , write atari ask sequel . now , real review . my review : clue chronicles follows story 11 unlucky party guests mysterious yacht owned ian masque . after he drops dead , mystery begins . box kill him ? so it seems ... join old cast-miss scarlet , mr. green , mrs. peacock , colonel mustard , professer plum , mrs. white-along new cast characters including-marina popov , julia kell , sabata , martin urfe , ( short time ) ian masque . you detective . nobody ever met this man person , what he want them , you ? there answer . but you need play game find it out . airtight plot doesn't stop-even after story ends-you gasping breathe heartstopping cliffhanger ending ! my grades : story 10/10-well thought out unexpected endinggameplay 6/10-minor glitches don't effect gameplay , but involve disappearing characters backgroundsoundtrack-9/10-music mostly fits scenesvo 9/10-the voiceovers great except one small part towards endgraphics 8/10-its old game-that sums it up , no ? finala-will always favorite ..	1
nba ballers phenom great game really fun play . what midway basically " advance " or fix original nba ballers who stared stephon marbary . midway made graphics better , gameplay better , litte more extra moves nice layout . layout looks cool way better then how it used look . reason why i give this game 4 star rather then 5 star loading game itself . ok i admit loading pretty long but its all worth it . what i mean game itself its more teens . i mean whole thing " ballers " i am not sure kids under 10 understand what it means how " bring it " game . original nba ballers i would say more kids , but since midway enhanced this game rather then change whole thing , i would say it blast teens 13+ . so what i am getting too if you under age 12 or 13 wait until 1 streetball comes out . but if your over 13 years age then then go out grab copy this game cause its blast ! -you	-1

i've counting down until i could get this release couldn't wait play all these great games again . when i got it started playing , it fun but disappointment kept mounting . little things like no manuals ( you open file and/or print them yourself ... not big deal itself , but come vivendi , quit so cheap ) no case cds ( you just get twopaper sleeves ) make package look incredibly cheap low quality . yes , these computer games 80s early 90s , but this package could put together better . graphics same originals , so i didn't expect any " update " there . i completed kq6 1 no problems , but kq5 annoying because you can't go back text ( or least , i haven't figured out how ) . " music " overpowers what characters saying . any problems you previous games , such difficult maneuvering , remain same , which expected . overall i guess my disappointment comes fact vivendi could made really nice package this , added some extras , beefed it up , included more information , stuff like . especially how long it took get this going . how many times release date pushed back ?? but no , it bare minimim cheapo production . i know it only $20 , but still ... could lot nicer . still must any kq fan tons fun play , but i am ultimately disappointed this product	1
we just saw wonderful movie picked up game way home . i'm 39 years old terrible games . this game sweet lots fun . food fights , soccer , searching things . if i it anyone . merry christmas one all	1
i think this great game my wife i currently addicted it . it definitely more simcity style play than civilization series ; though it allows more granular control your city than simcity . only civilization aspect research which enjoyable . but other than there isn't much " civ " civcity ( which isn't necessarily bad ) . this game reminds me heavily german title " knights merchants " ( 1998 ) but much better implementation . note , if you find this game isn't you , try very similar but much easier " glory roman empire " . this game definitely challenging , but good way . someone complained small maps - maps get bigger your progress through game small maps small reason - it adds challenge game ( example , there island map limited resources which requires you build shipping fleet ) . interface generally good , but there some non-intuitive things like sending tributes . i think graphics nice , especially temples , but it definitely not end-all far graphics go . there lot city beautification enhancements ( fountains , gardens , etc ) i don't tend mess , but they pretty increase your city happiness . ( your citizens candidly tell you if they think your city " dump " . i think they excellent job citizen interaction - amusing yet useful . ) regarding " game breaking " click-select bug . i'm playing 1024x768 resolution i barely any problems it . when i , i simply rotate my map i'm able select what i want . i don't consider bug " game breaking " or even all annoying ; though i'm glad they're coming out patch fix it . all all , i think game play excellent . like all modern games , implementation rushed ( nothing patch won't fix , though ) . i suspect game age well high-replay value	1
gothic 2 only rpg i ever replayed ; add-on included this gold version enhancing expanding original game fantastically . i live uk where this version still not released ( why ? ) , so get copy i order it sent friend states , who kindly posted it me . gothic 2 living world where things happen around you people get their lives - go work , then pub , maybe cook some food then home bed , example - animals , prey getting chased predators . quests interesting much more than just take this package so-and-so . some faction quests you even get see play other side if you replay game say , join guards instead merceneries . add-on some brilliant new areas , quests creatures whole thing wonderfully integrated into original game . gothic games only games where i gone practised my swordplay fields , fighting more than button bashing . fighting actually fun these games , not something i say any others ( although i high hopes oblivion ... ) . british gaming magazines criticised gothic 2 : -you not able choose your appearance . who cares when you look believable your armour weapons change ? anyway , playing first person more immersive than third person then it doesn't really matter what you look like . -the voices not very good . ok , you get recognize some actors ' voices playing different parts final " things " ( i don't want give any kind spoiler away ! ) voices bit pants , especially what they , but it doesn't matter because rest game so good . -not enough stats/skills raise personalise your character . ok , so there not vast range skills stats , but enough make you choose where spend your points specialise , so what more you want ? 50 different skills choose instead 15 , say , not make better game . ultimately , if you like rpgs , you should buy this game many hours pure fun . maybe you too decide it too scary go out night instead find nice bed you sleep night away , or bench sit admire view whilst waiting dawn some light see what coming next ...	1

that exactly what this game says me . i just couldn't refuse . that 2 reasons : i love movies , game nasty . what f***in game man . awesome . i like it better than gta games scarface . maybe it cause i'm such fan movie . maybe it cause i'm sicilian . but i love this game . i haven't glued tv like this since devil may cry 3 . controls great . fighting shooting spectacular . easy get hold . voice overs make it ridiculous listen watch , especially cinema scenes . marlon brando , james caan , robert duvall . only thing ... where al pacino !??! i would sworn he'd it . michael corleone nothing like ... michael corleone . that my only real complaint . why why why isn't he here ??? anyway , back pros . virtual new york city here great . cars driving around , people walking streets conversation . fact you rob banks trucks sick . then there extortion . wow . i love running around extorting businesses . i love fact you things however you like . talk someone man man ( or woman ) . smash up their shop . smack owner around little bit . it fun hell . mob face awesome . i really think my character looks like me . guns crazy . especially upgrades . i got my guns all leveled up they ridiculous . way you create your own character you play part storyline fantastic . it taken me 40 hours become don nyc finish game . only thing i left now find rest film reels . but basically it taken my 40 hours beat game . what hell ? i'll start beginning again	1

it very confusing i find some hints playing game , too much going back forth hunting things if you miss something you sometimes can't go back get it . overall i like it because it not overly difficult so far .. i hate games so difficult only experienced gamers play	-1

this game really great . i would recommend this game anyone . it great game play family or yourself . i this game awhile now finished it 2 times . first time i've finished it , it kinda challenging last level , but when i went over it again i zipped right threw it . this game doesn't get you bored all you'll into it right beginning game . i like how you choose whoever you want during game . graphics well they aren't great movie . but overall it awesome . i play it over over again . it great !!!!!!!!!!!	1
incredibles movie pleasant suprise , featuring lifelike characters , well animated fight scenes , interesting story . game follows closely movie , few additional easter eggs . first , good : incredibles game fun gameplay , good overall graphics , multiple cut scenes , nice ammount replayability . only problems game , first , game very short . there aren't many levels , they aren't very long . good player beat entire game less than day , but it probably take new player around week . most length caused some hard sections , such first two omnidroid battles places where game makers didn't make it easy grab rope or something . game heavily scripted , making it easy predict what you face next . final problem you barely spend any time playing dash or voilet . dash two levels , voilet only one . game very fun bonus feature you unlock halfway through game , called battle . battle , you choose either mr. or mrs. incredible , battle seemingly endless waves enemies . all all , incredibles short , fun game worth rental , but you should think it before you buy i t.t hanks reading , bubba " samus "	-1
after release star wars episode iii : revenge sith theaters we got lego star wars ; game lot fun play simply because it emulated movies rather well all characters made entirely legos . lego star wars ii : original trilogy even better simple fact nostalgia . any star wars fan enjoy this . you'll begin game cantina mos eisley . this hub , there you go into any three episodes play through them . start you'll only able choose new hope , but after completing first chapter , you choose empire strikes back or return jedi . you go through three episodes you'll some most memorable moments movies acted out entirely legos . these moments aren't only memorable , but they're given hilarious charm . these moments also actual original versions movies well . other words , han solo shoot firs t.t he game visually striking . seeing your favorite characters original star wars films legos quite treat . not only you get nostalgia star wars , but legos well . even better hilarious antics most scenes . benefit nostalgia even more how john williams ' classic score accompanies each every level game . star wars fan this game ultimate nostalgia . you play through each classic episodes , you'll control several characters . not all once , but you'll end up switch . times you may only two characters , others there may many seven your party once . your characters , depending who they , also their own unique skills they use . jedi example , double jump use force . those who wield blasters grappling hook allows them ascend accessible platforms . droids open up special doors you . other characters , like jawas ewoks able go into vents access areas other characters can't . all actuality , they're really no different than their counterparts original lego star wars . also like original lego star wars , you'll constantly switch characters order get through each every area . you'll switch r2-d2 open up door , example . more than one person play time , which also really cool . you also beat up your allies if you wish , they respawn instantly . gameplay isn't completely same , though , there some small tweaks made here there . additions gameplay aren't huge , but they welcome . you progress through levels all your characters may able assemble certain materials together form droid help them fight . original lego star wars this ability only given jedi , but here everyone it . there also moments when you'll dress up stormtrooper order gain access through certain doors . you'll also given chance some point dress up bounty hunter you'll able use thermal detonators . characters also their own unique abilities . chewie , example , rip stormtroopers arms right out his sockets . all these welcome additions , that not even all there gameplay . time time you'll command vehicles . landspeeders , millennium falcon , x-wing more you take some more memorable moments film , like destroying death star . it probably only take you five hours very least complete story mode all three episodes . however , lego star wars ii full extras . each time you dispatch enemy , whether it story mode or not , you'll earn money . you also destroy certain objects obtain money . you use money you gain purchase cheats hidden characters . each time you get new character they'll walk around hub , you switch them . " purchasing " characters isn't only way get them . you could easily just use one story mode you've got him or her . you'll also get hidden characters if you've got save data original lego star wars . just unlocking all characters takes lot time . importance unlocking characters so you play through certain aspects free play mode . there places story mode default characters couldn't reach . these hidden characters might able reach it , though , so you find yourself playing through levels again . good news these levels so much fun playing through second , third or even fourth time no hassle all . free mode also offers way you customize what character looks like . you could put yoda head luke skywalker body , example . this mostly just lot fun mess around . some combinations just all out crazy . you could , example , put chewbacca head leia body when she wearing slave outfit return jedi . this really doesn't whole lot gameplay whole , but it quite fun mess around , combinations endless . only real problem this game i really think there little , if any , challenge all . each time you die you respawn right where you left off you infinite lives . there really no such thing game over . if you die only penalty you lose money . however , sheer fun factor game enough away , still makes lego star wars ii treat . lego star wars ii surpasses original just everyway . it star wars game classic trilogy instant perfection . if you love original star wars movies , you'll definitely want this game . positive side+based off original theatrical versions not special editions+beautiful game+addictive gameplay+c o-o mode+several extras hidden characters+customizable characters+tons replay valueon negative side-the story mode quite short-while not really much con this game , it got very little challeng	1
i purchased nintendo ds ( pink color ) couple weeks ago . because i travel several times year , i needed something could entertain me during long plane trips . year ago , i purchased gameboy advance but i didn't like graphics . screen too small it difficult see what going . needless say , i sold it few weeks after . i still interested buying portable game system however didn't know whether purchase ds or psp . psp cost quite bit more but it also allows you play movies it . i ended up going ds because store where i bought it only demos ds , not psp . nintendo ds good graphics ( least far better than gba ) . one thing you must look when deciding which portable game system best you selection games . majority nintendo ds games kids . however , there several games adults play " tickle your brain " . i tend go puzzle games but few kid games fun well . what i also like ds you don't press down too hard screen using stylus . you purchase screen protectors your ds but unless you're pressing down much harder than you should , you won't need these . also , you store stylus bottom your system . box contains extra stylii case you lose one but handy storage compartment should prevent this happening . you don't charge system too often . usually one charge lasts several hours . however , whenever i'm playing home , i always plug adapter . also , there headphone jack case you don't want annoy other people audio game you're playing . headphones don't come system so you buy them seperately ( i bought ds starter pack which comes special ds headphones ) . far portable game systems go , i suggest purchasing ds . they're perfect any age ( preschool age adult ) price isn't * too * up there .	1

best friends , lydia celeste separated eight years ago when , after death her mother , celeste father became director far-off dragonvale academy . now lydia start her first day student magic dragonvale looks forward reunited her friend . but when she arrives , she finds academy deserted except one odd character : wolf who claims dragon . where everybody ? what going here ? this wolf really trusted ? these just some questions you must answer you explore school . keepsake , first game canadian wicked studios , lovely 3d point click adventure tradition syberia . i mean " lovely " literally : first thing strike you beauty environments . castle ornate knotwork motifs colour themes , making exploration pleasure . there isn't lot animation , but what there well ; water effect especially nice . characters slightly less well-realised , but still quite good . sound also quite good . music beautiful , different haunting motif each character section castle . f/x somewhat limited bit repetetive : lots footsteps bird calls , fire water sounds , etc . however , they fit well design rest game , so i can't complain . i'm very surprised see so many complaints here dialog . i really saw nothing wrong it or voice acting . rather , conversation used explain points not necessarily elucidated action ( philosophy magical system , example ) well develop characters their relationships . i considered good writing , not opposite . game starts cute little tutorial , which one other game characters leads you through controls . i kind liked , i dislike reading manuals it obviated need kind introductory sequence you find lot games this type ; you coul just jump right . puzzles quite mix : several straight " games , " couple mechanical , including one that quite involved , some riddle-type , some inventory , kind slider , huge maze ( not counting castle itself , ) . there no timed puzzles you can't die . i liked way inventory worked : once you acquired requisite item , it automatically used relevant spot . so you didn't keep opening your inventory , picking up item , clicking it hotspot , etc . rest , they fairly straightforward ... except riddle-type . clues provided so obscure i can't believe anyone but designers could possibly make sense them . fortunately , game includes hint feature , which give three hints each puzzle , after which it offers solve puzzle you . i use " solve " feature once , when even clues explained didn't much enlighten me . but when you use " solve " feature , you don't actually get see solution , just result it . so i still don't know what puzzle ! hint feature also tell you if you don't prerequisistes necessary continue puzzle . if you use it when you're not puzzle-view , it clarify your next objective . i found both these aspects very helpful . i experience one bizarre glitch game : intervals , without reason or warning , sound would suddenly start stutter echo most annoying way . adjusting game settings no effect . i eventually discovered i could correct problem exiting game rebooting my computer . this seemed necessary once every couple hours . i completed keepsake 25 hours -- possibly little more . i deligthed it kept me busy so long most adventure games these days barely provide 10 hours play . some second part game get little draggy , lot toiling back forth through castle . however , keepsake good choice gamers who like straight adventure fantasy context . but glitch couple illogical puzzles , i would given it five stars . i eagerly look forward wicked studios ' next effort	-1
i wasn't sure if i wanted purchase this game because it got so many bad reviews ( magazines , amazon reviewers , g4tv ) . however , because i love puss boots because recent price drop , i decided give it go . well , it not like final fantasy ( many compared it ) . it more like gauntlet : dark legacy . graphics really good . address criticism , game not cheap movie novelty created left over scraps . my only complaint you can't choose characters you want each level ; they choosen you . however , you switch 4 characters given most them cool . fun factor =3 . 5replayability = 3graphics = 4.5 controls = 5camera angles =3 . 5mostly young teens under enjoy this game . even if you dont like shrek , this game appeal grims fairy tale fans ( like me ) . i got mine " new " ebgames only 9.99 hurry , before they gone !	-1

" prince persia sands time , " first game this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone breath away . gameplay original , flawless , beautiful . storyline sucked you didn't let you go even after you'd beaten it 6 times over . it flawless game . last year , first sequel , " prince persia warrior within , " released . while game contained improvements quality graphics " freeform fighting " techniques , game less pleasing both critics gamers . ubisoft turned humrous , witty , intelligent prince " sands " into angry , nu-metal-rocking , humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent ruining everyone time . while story equally engaging " sands , " " warrior " failed because it simply not much fun play . luckily , ubisoft saved best last . " two thrones " easily one greatest games i ever played . concluding one greatet videogame trilogies ever created , ubisoft developed near flawless game . it though they took strengths both games , removed weaknesses second game , created thing pure brilliance . " two thrones " contains all witty , punning elements first game mixes them exciting , more violent elements second game while removing everying ruined prince demeanor second game . original , fun , saracastic prince back , largely because ubisoft also brought back one things made " sands " so great : farrah . farrah perfect foil our hero . she adds humor , power , creativity , definitely sexiness game " warrior " lacking . farrah relationship prince far my favorite relationship i've ever " played " videogame ubisoft deserves big brownie points bringing her back . gameplay " two thrones " amazing . throughout game , gamer occassionally forced play " dark prince " there situations where " normal , " original prince unable get through . other games , playing two characters often appeared more gimmick than actual , integral part story , but " two thrones , " reasoning behind prince frequent changing prince dark prince back again very well explained very important overall story " two thrones telling . " fight scenes epicly fun play . this prince more moves than he two last games combined his battle techniques joy use . new " speed kill " method killing some opponents adds certain amount skill brutality many fights otherwise would seemed boring taken far too long complete . i welcomed addition speed kills once i fully learned how use them . prince still moves acrobatically ever . there still wall-running , jumping , flipping , handsprings , etc .... only real notable movement difference when gamer plays dark prince . dark prince chain/weapon/thing used grab onto bars away or objects would otherwise out reach prince then swing over them . it not different anything prince before but it definitely fun worked well flow game . all all i rate this best new sands pop trilogy . it awesome game should played anyone who ever enjoyed 3rd person adventure game . if you haven't played either one first two games warned : storyline actually rather complex you missing much story if you haven't played first two games . if you played first two games , this story terrific conclusion prince tale , way it wraps around back beginning trilogy floored me when i finished it . buy this game . ( something worth noting ... after you beat game you unlock many videos , chief among these " alternate/real ending " warrior within formerly only available if you beat warrior after collecting all life upgrades .... so if you beat warrior without all life upgrades didn't see " real " ending ... beating this game shows it you video collection )	1
we cable go bad us , i could never find replacement . finally , i saw wireless device . i bought this my daughter . she i play pokemon gba . we no longer within cable reach . but least same room . matter fact , we more fun now . wireless faster than cable . its easy put take off . you hook up multiple players using wireless . note , you can't use wireless cable , its either/or . also , gba , you newer games says wireless . its not backwards compatible . recommend this device gba tv adapter	1
it works great ...... great quality great sound especially great color detail ...... only thing sucks actually getting cables into tv plugs , it horrible ..... most tv i've seen component plugs , plugs built very close together each component ends ( blue , green , red ) where cap kind goes over actual thing you put ( usually gold plated thing)are almost too big so you can't fully plug all 5 them ( 3 video , 2 audio ) but just kinda push em just enough so it actually works .... other than , quality everything fantasti	1

i am very hooked this controller . first i thought idea wire less controller just more hassle , but i'm completely convinced now . mainly cause it stops my biggest fear happening ; someone pulling my console down . this didn't happen first xbox because quick-disconnect ; but it happened quite few times my ps2 i would die if my 360 fell . also this feels more like remote now instead just game controller , making it easy go through your system dark know your no gonna trip if you get up . finally , i owned almost every console nes this far best controller i used . just buy it already	1
controller excellent but some reason creator put four little knots controller joystick i no ideal why but if you use this controller play fast paced game like boxing watch out , because tips your thumb hurt , i am talking real pain . it takes fun out game you playing . i would give this controller 5 star rating if it wasn't 4 knots joystick , hopefully more people complain they remove them . this shows developers don't play games long enough	-1

mario kart double dash essentially mario kart 64 then some . game brings alot new cards table , which i review below . mario kart double dash improved last game immensely , saying alot , because mario kart 64 one most fun games available n64 . first way it improved previous game allowing players choose 2 characters race instead 1 . this makes bit more complex control scheme , but otherwise doubles fun . game also features tons available characters play : mario luigipeach daisywariowalluigibowser baby bowserkoopa paratroopababy mariobaby luigidonkey kong diddy kongyoshi , andbirdothe game ol ' grand prix mode time trials , but it also some new unlockable features , such : new cartsnew charactersa new circuitnew battle mode stages ... more , but i don't want spoil anything . mario kart double dash multiplayer modes better than ever , too . not only battle versus modes once again available , but there new types battles : shine theif babomb blast . all all , mario kart double dash extremely fun replayable , enough features unlockables keep you occupied entertained while . i enjoy it , i think any gamecube owner should pick this game up . i reccomend renting it first see if you like it , then making your decision . thanks reading , bubba " samus	1
those who time patience learn ins-and-outs this , it great , realistic racing . my favorite part , though , going one-on-one trying outrun cops . it wild very reminicent famous chase scenes french connection i ii . playing this way never fails draw audience whoever house time , they end up getting wrapped up it , too , cheering sidelines enthusiastic advice like " look out ! " , " watch out road block ahead ! " , " you've lost him ! " , etc . if you're not playing , it still great watch ! p.s. i initially bought this my son , got hooked watching him play .	1
this really nice game no matter which system you get it ; especially if you're huge fan show like me . first off , this features impressive gameplay awesome 3-d graphics . heck , they've still got squiggly outlines right ; even 3-d form ! next , there some great special features no needed codes like feature cast members who voices eds plank music video ! you garner these cool extras finding chickens each level . now this game , you play all three eds their neverending hijinks jawbreakers . fact , you find jawbreakers if look real hard each level . there even jawbreaker dispenser somewhere game , but you got certain amount cash hand get them . playing all three ed characters tough , but quite fun way . ed(the one eyebrow ) , you pick up objects throw them using " batter-ed " move smash through walls stuff . edd(the one hat ) , you use his slingshot his distant objects make them fall , use his wit activate machines , use " trampol-edd " move go little higher . eddy(take guess ) , use " el mongo stink bomb " stun your opponents use " tower eddy " move walk across thin walkways , sneak around , grab high items within reach . you even interact other characters show , but watch out those squirrels ! there couple bonus levels seem reminicent eds ' halloween special well those special features i aforementioned . overall , this game , though fairly short full play , very nice one . cartoon network may not much video games ( i.e. dexter : " mandark lab " ps1 , powerpuff girls : " chemical x-traction " n64 ps1 , cartoon network : " speedway " " block party " gba ) , but they seem caught up now this new kids next door game . i hope you enjoy this much i . one more thing : they seem released this game just time new ed-isodes tv ! i'm starting like those , well	1

i bought my 360 pro summer 2006 , it i got oblivion , ghost recon , nfs most wanted hitman blood money . everything going great until two months ago it started freezing regularly . i didn't pay much attention it , but week after i got three rings death ... yup general hardware failure !!! i got little frustrated , but i immediately sent email microsoft my situation . they answered within 24 hours said system repaired . i shocked because i don't even live us !!! i started calling my local video game stores none them fixing 360s yet . after i called like 5 stores , i called small store middle residential area guess what ? man told me his 360 suffered same problem he could fix it !! i little skeptical , but anyway i took my system there left it overnight . my surprise next morning i got call him saying it fixed !!! i couldn't believe it , i asked him how much he going charge he said : oh ! just give me 20 bucks . then he told me six months ago his 360 same problem , he bought both pelican fan stand nyko intercooler he hadn't problem since . two accessories together both make like 33 dollars they prevent your console frying , so its absolutely worth it , just try follow warnings people who bought two fans posted , because they very important , could mean difference messing your xbox up letting you play countless hours without overheating . last games i bought splinter cell gears war now i'm able play 5+ hours without console even getting warm touch my fingers . yes system overheats ; you just take right measures solve your problems ... hope this review helped , cheers	1
admittedly , i haven't played lot strategy rpgs . i attempted play final fantasy tactics , generally considered classic genre , one point , but i found it really dry i serious problems class system seems really unbalance game making it too easy . i've never really much motivation seek out other examples srpg genre because there nippon-ichi disgaea series , unique it fun . long-lasting too . you spend several hundred hours playing through disgaea : hour darkness disgaea 2 : cursed memories beat all bonus content beyond main campaign . disgaea 2 shines more polished version first disgaea . character sprites more vivid , spell effects more visual flare . music dialogue sharper audio quality . all bonus quests first disgaea expanded such inclusion dark court endless dungeon item world even more stuff dark assembly . however , it also so similar first game it feels almost like expansion pack rather than true sequel . story disgaea 2 similar first one , it highly character driven told quite bit humor . overlord zenon tranformed all residents world veldime into monsters . adell , last remaining human , embacks quest slay overlord rozalin , zenon haughty neglected daughter . way , they meet colorful cast enemies , rivals , allies they attempt crack mystery behind near-immortal zenon . it enjoyable story , if bit meandering . it one major susprise twist end caught me off guard though it probably shouldn't . combat , like most srpgs , takes place series grid-like maps , usually four chapter . characters move around so many squares per turn opportunity attack any enemies falls within their attack range . battlefields littered geo-panels , multicolored pyramids confer penalties bonuses certain areas maps . there dozens classes , both monster human , fashion powerful army out . choose wisely , because grand total 10 deployed any one time . unfortunately , experience points only go character deals final blow so level disparities characters combined steadily increasing difficulty curve make it neccesary replay some maps times . luckily , difficulty curve much more finely tuned this game , so you spend less time leveling up than first game . main campaign disgaea 2 pretty short , i clocked little over 30 hours my first play through , granted i barely touched much sidequests . i also found it little easy side . i didn't die once until i penultimate chapter . i don't know it because game easier or if it just spending over one hundred hours conquering first game . sprgs probably hardest sub-set out rpg genre . disgaea series highly recommended experienced inexperienced players alike . disgaea 2 many different systems enhance playing experience , but unlike many games , doesn't force player learn how work them all . players option playing game face value or learning all complex systems more enriched experience . this very accessable game , this genre definitely needs more games strike balance too hard or too easy .	-1
granted , disgaea 2 won't much fans fighting , fps , or action genres , but those who love anime strategy bundle fun . battle system outside same disgaea , but there some interesting important improvements . here few : one , there lift+attack move ( lifting character then attacking , like makai kingdoms . ) two : character who assigned attack , but unable because target they going attack eliminated character before they could attack no longer loses their move . instead , they get move again instead . three : guns operate significantly different way than bows ( problem disgaea 1 ) giving them great utility . four : speed down , def down , other effects occur more often result weapon usage , easier see . five : treasure chests now part battle ! six : item bag ( i'm pretty sure ) larger . seven : additional battle items available , one them cellular phones . ( you'll find out what they .. ) eight : team attacks become more ridiculous . ( this good thing ! )nine : battle maps much improved , more interesting . game now really spiffy intro , ( hi-res ! ) maintains same irreverent humor previous games . quality , however , par ( actually , better than ) disgaea : hour darkness . voice acting manages not annoying ( many cases its very good ! ) it refreshing play good guy again . laharl obviously game ( he seen character collage art ) there numerous references la pucelle tactics , disgaea : hour darkness , phantom brave makai kingdoms . manual lacks clarity some places , lot graphics still very pixely . overall , though , its hard beat this game fun . but warned , it takes long time play	1
i originally put off playing this game because i feared it would ruin integrity ffvii me . i also heard many bad reviews all over place it . however , i found it very fun game . first i few gripes camera voices . it clumsy , unfocused , generally all over place some voices just wrong(but luckily vincent okay ) . however , story engaging enough i adjusted camera after while . while it pretty much like every other shooter(you shoot things , run around , get items , shoot things some more ) , it some familliar interesting things sets it aside . first , it fills some things vincents story ffvii people may recall . then , there familliar settings . one these settings(which completely freaked me out ) burned out version shinra building . good thing use materia . it equipped weapons used . then there returning characters , which it always enjoyment see . gameplay fast chaotic , but fun way . there even special boss end .......... overall , pretty fun game	-1
i rented game week enjoyed it greatly . fluid animation great sound gave plot levels firepower stay true movie . boss bit predictable however i saw nothing but solid game . recommend whole family	-1

cooking mama esentially series cooking mini-games strung together form ' recipes ' dishes . it enjoyable game but it lacks enough depth truely replayable . when enjoyed casually i think this game could last while , but aside these dishes there little else . i found myself wanting unlock more than recipes , find new ways using my cooking practice . one way this game could easily made classic would add some competitive play it . how iron chef matches or wi-fi tournaments ? but there not much this game once novelty wears off , which me 6 hours later . i've come back it casually but not more than few minutes here there . it , however , well worth $20 price tag	1

playstation dual shock such comfortable popular layout pc gamepad companies like saitek logitech try copy it , they usually don't very good job . their d-pads always too awkward , or their construction too lightweight . dual shock solid built last . i'm emulation gamer , thanks smartjoy usb adapter i use real ps1/ps2 gamepad zsnes bleem . my only gripes pad : ) start/select buttons really should've moved up after addition analog sticks . i'm always finding myself fumbling over sticks trying get start select . ) while d-pad very sturdy , it kills my thumbs after couple hours play . kinda makes me wish they taken turbo touch 360 approach used touch-sensitive panel instead hard plastic arrows	-1
i firstly say i am not pre-teen average age range gamecube , but i still like this controller . when i first saw it , i thought it would too small my hands , button placement looked awkward . i couldn't more wrong . controller fits comfortably , even into my larger than average hands ( xbox , i prefer bigger , older controller smaller controller ) all buttons within easy reach . controller set up way controlls very instinctive most games . it also allows you roll your thumb button button , allowing smoother gameplay than systems where you lift your thumb press buttons . shoulder buttons controller sensitive degree they pushed , allowing more versatile controlls than ps2 shooters , racing games , few others . control stick comfortable precise . c-stick usually superb , but few third party games i found it awkward . because it not same size shape most control sticks , it awkward using it one . c-stick , however , performs admirably madden , where i find it preferable xbox ps2 controllers . only quality issue i found gamecube c-stick . if you tend slam your controllers ground , or leave them sat , etc , stick sometimes breaks , so system thinks you always pushing it upwards . overall , very comfortable easy use controller . high quality manufacturing , one glitch	1
when i first went shopping second controller my gamecube , i admit i looking one matched my platinum edition controller . i couldn't find one wasn't wavebird ( nothing wrong wavebird - wireless controller - i know , but i just too cheap spend extra $10 ) . so i bought black controller match my tv . now i think it , buying different controller smart thing . why didn't i plan first place ? i spent part winter battling cold or flu various times , i can't underestimate importance controlling spread viruses bacteria . different-colored controllers makes it easier remember which controller i've using nose-blowing sessions . when housemate or friend wants play gamecube i lay suffering other couch , i am able croak out words " use black one today . trust me . " i also phobia against third-party hardware - so it good nintendo ( not mention profitable nintendo ) sell spare parts . most important things controller : it fit comfortably your hand , buttons easy find use ? only thing i don't like placement button . cord plenty long , buttons responsive enough . i also like they're color-coded	1

i more than 500 albums my music collection , including more than 650 artists . while this not largest collection -my friends even much larger ones- i find it extremely uncomfortable locate specific artist or album using regular game controller . even while using limited edition media controller you would spend lot time locating specific media . that why i find extremely useful alphanumerical keypad included this control , it also useful when changing tv channels . price not high , it well designed . highly recommended mcx users	1

here blast nostalgia your gameboy advance . final fantasy iv advance aka final fantasy ii aka final fantasy iv hard-type treat old-school rpg players . back its hayday , final fantasy iv gold standard what rpg should . first series remakes wonderful streak snes final fantasies , final fantasy iv back better than ever . story good it ever . final fantasy 4 what final fantasy 2 ( japanese numbering ) tried : mixed well developed story memorable characters good if simple gameplay . this story cecil dark knight who renounces his loyalty corrupt kingdom baron . baron making war against other nations world capture four elemental crystals . when his king commands him kill innocent , cecil sets out quest make things right take him around world , center earth , moon . he unravels mystery who really behind actions baron , he joined cast over ten playable characters . each them reason join fight . characterization may not seem much today standards , but this game made age when square believed less more . you revealed motive once then you moved instead going over over same psychological problem again again . unlike playstation port absolutely no upgrades beyond its retranslated script , ff4advance few minor visual tweaks . some game sprites seem tweaked abit more definition character portraits redrawn put dialogue boxes indicate who speaking . most new portraits fairly close old ones , edge rydia actually improvement , but new one rosa , paladin cecil , edward particular aren't so nice look . there also two new dungeons ability tackle final boss any other ( still living ) playable characters than fixed party five like original . all these new features very unobtrusive so you take advantage them if you'd like extra challenge or ignore them altogether . instead using script original release contained numerous spelling grammatical mistakes censored due nintendo america then extremely strict guidelines , ff4a contains more accurate revamped version . course , " you spoony bard " line , thankfully , left intact . it classic . if not one issue i'd say this undoubtedly best version game available . final fantasy iv really hard game . ff4a not hard all- least early game . i don't know if difficulty scaled back because they thought people didn't want waste gba battery life hours leveling up or because i've played this game many times before , but it just seemed too easy . anyone whose played it when it first came out should remember least super tough boss battle it baigan , magnus sisters , evil wall or something else . this time through they where like cake walk . also it seems active time battle set up such way it gives your party advantage . your party seems regain their turns twice fast enemy . half-way through game , legendary difficulty starts creeping back final trek core moon you'll thankful any break game give you . final fantasy iv shows this port it stands test time . instead feeling hoary , old , outdated , it feels just much fun it fifteen years ago .	1

okay , so there tons reviews ffviii intense hatred love both ends spectrum . so , what if your indesicive purchasing this game ? here some simple facts . whether or not you enjoy this game hinge fact you ) like squall leonhart b)enjoy sci-fi based rpg opposed strict high fantasy finally c)have patience understand draw/junction system . i loved this game very much because all three points never issue me . there some weaknesses game but most just come scripting plot . primary one lone wolf introvert leading entire team high spirited extroverts . would drive anyone up wall though . i think many people didn't like squall because they knew someone like him real life . only other real plot weakness major big bad villans ( edea , adel ultimecia ) seem take complete backseat all squall personal problems ( getting know rinoa , learning more his family)i'd rather more balance two plot forces but that i t.t he draw/junction system which powers up pc requires lot more thought than other systems ff used but if you remember what stats used ( like vit defense spr magic defense ) it go lot smoother . if you like rpg like xenosaga , or phantasy star or even knights old republic then all means get this your collection ... just keep mind points i made before	1

" gun " western-themed game features young cowboy , colton white , search discover secrets his past . most impressive aspect game surprisingly detailed its historical depiction " wild west " . example , game shows effects railroad expansion american indians , while also including chinese coolies worked these railroads . other hand , geography way off , colton ride horseback dodge city , kansas empire , new mexico matter minutes . course , what really matters video game how much fun it play this " gun " receives fairly high marks . game primarily mission based . colton must complete variety tasks both advance story line build up his stats through series side missions , such riding pony express catching outlaws . i also enjoyed searching gold mines . however , i wish game allowed more free exploration . example , towns full buildings . but it really not possible explore them except casino few others . game also little short side . but still it fun gaming experience that worth buying	-1

this headset works very well . if you're not used rubber in-canal ear piece , there several other tips bit less intrusive . it worked quite well limited amount time i've used it xbconnect . but price ! you could probably buy similar plantronics headset would compatable communicator cartridge-adapter ( which isn't included this package ; you buy it seperately ! ) , but not designed specifically xbox less than half this price . i very fortunate find two circuit city they discontinued recently five bucks piece ! maybe amazon soon drop price like everyone else ...	1
this headset way better than box one , considering box one broke hurry . sound quality awesome you don't get any annoying breathing mic . pick this one up	1
this review going based 3 categories . good , bad , ugly . good : eye inspiring graphics special effects . very impressive nightmaresh sound effects . very scarey game lots lots heart stopping surprises . game you either jumping out your seat or shooting up anything moves or falls floor . bad : game lacks lot original doom series . over half original creatures doom 1 , 2 , final doom missing which very disappointing . sound track creatures not resemble anything next original doom series except rocket-launching revenant archvile . id software must spent lot time designing those two , unfortunently , they forgot add rest creatures . imp , i didn't clue what those tall creatures 8 eight eyes , throwing fire balls me . i didn't know what they until i downloaded it my pda game . what disappointment ! lot times while i playing game , it seemed if i play quake 2 or half-life but not doom . don't get me wrong game . game good game but they should named it doom ( beginning ) instead doom 3 . ugly : no joystick or game pad support . only controller support keyboard mouse which cause your left hand get carpartunnel constantly pressing tab , shift , , , , , , keys . game way too dark . lot times , you're shooting open air , then turning flash light see if they're dead or still walking around , only find out they're behind you tearing you pieces . i heard lot people stating game caused their computers slow down crawl . i myself didn't problem . my computer 3 years old what even worse i'm running video card 6 years old . my system amd xp 2800+ over clocked equal amd xp 3200+ , 640mb ram , diamond monster sound 300mx old 3dfx voodoo 5500 64mb video ram . it took me awhile find right driver combination my voodoo card because 3dfx went out business back december 2000 . but anyway , under timedemo it states i get 19 fps but under actual game play i get 38 fps high quality mode resolution 1024x768 . go figure ! i can't use ultra high quality mode because my voodoo card doesn't support tnl ( transform lighting ) i can't tell difference high quality ultra high quality except ultra hight quality runs slower . by-the-way . my video card sound card not direct 9.0 compliant so don't believe everything you read system requirements	-1
brilliant remake original classic ! although i am avid fan first doom ... i strongly urge you not juxtapose two . if you sit back pick apart differences them , you'll never enjoy doom 3 . why this game well worth buy ? many reasons . superb graphics first you'll notice . environment rich detailed . don't worry whether or not your computer handle it . you easily build one easily capable running game full settings less than $900 ... if you're comp so old you can't run it like this ... you may due upgrade anyways . weapons great very realistic . like real world , your arsenal must reloaded after so many rounds fired . handy pair digits help you monitor your clip total ammo any weapon though . so , plan ahead keep your guns fully loaded . endless series hallways some people complaining ... it makes absolutely no sense stadium set up mars research base . game offers plenty larger rooms adequately utilize heavier weapons such rocket launcher without blowing your own face off . ambient sounds game more than enough keep you edge your seat . dead bodies randomly levitate fly across room , grates knocked around unseen forces betruger haunting laugh often accompany many these ghostly actions more . enemies fierce , enemies bad ( fearful ) , any one them go easy kill downright lethal . you may not get very many good looks them , but you really shouldn't trying admire pixels something that trying kill you . take screenshot look later if you want take what monsters look like . experiment your arsenal ... learn best weapon job conserving ammo won't problem all . big issue most people seem lighting . yes , 22nd century you'd expect marines lights mounted their weapons . id software isn't stupid ... flashlight all your guns would made game lot easier lot less fun . switching your light your gun ... game forces you choose able see enemy able attack enemy . remember , this game " horror " genre . horror thrives you asking questions like " where it ? what it ? where it gonna pop out next ? " go rent horror movie you'll see what i mean . it dark ! doom 3 meant like this . buy game ... or borrow it buddy . turns lights off turn volume up . if you like horror ... it pull you right .	1
i looking black white deluxe version ( expansion pack ) came across this . i little hesitant purchasing it because one reviews ( computer dude ) said none games activation numbers . let me start saying this not true . this little four page installation manual tells how install all four games ( really five including black white expansion pack ) back all five activation numbers . i installed black white without any problems up half night playing it . only difference these games originals all documentation ( manuals etc . ) except four page installation guide , game cds . so if you looking couple these games this great deal information computer dude claiming their no activation numbers inaccurate	-1

people pick rockstar group their grand theft auto series , but i actually found bully game much more redeeming . you're schoolboy taking stereotypical cliques . it pretty clear why you're depressed teenage boy when game starts . apparently your dad died , your mom remarried elderly , grumpy old man who wants you out picture . your mom more than happy dump you off stay-all-year school while she goes off mr. moneybucks . top , school officials pretty nasty you right start . hogwarts this not ! then you go into run-down dorm , other kids start beating up you ! it time you stand up yourself make stand . there various groups kids this school - nerds , jocks , greasers preppies . activities you raise or lower your respect level each group . you go class too - there time ! if you're able manage your schedule properly , you participate some pretty fun mini-games ( word scramble challenging ! ) earn you new skills . there girls court , usually they want specific item . so you numerous quests go . bully activities range escorting nerd safely his locker , running races protecting yourself attacks . you get clothing way , customize your look ( within school regulations , course ) . it bit depressing , sometimes , see how these mid-teen guys treat each other , but this actually happen many schools . i'm sure pretty much every person who once teen name cliques existed their school . graphics rather good ps2 , sounds , while again bit depressing teen environment , work well game too . one hand i not really like swearing game , but certain teens fact swear far worse than this game ! i'd even say this more like fable than other grand theft autos , some ways you choose how you react situations . this game won't enjoyed people who squeamish violence - it , after all , involve teen guys all bashing each other very inane reasons . it also involves lot bullying - you might imagine . still , if you deal those issues , you'll find really involving game might actually make you think how treat others well	1

man , i am sick people mentioning violence cursing sex that this game . duh !!! this redundant saying sun bright hot . i don't even see what big deal . gore it isn't exactly realistic ( blood splattering gushing isn't great-looking ) i've seen much more " disturbing " games . violence almost like cartoon violence some ways . it isn't really big deal . there some very moderate cursing there some sex . yes , you pick up hookers . no , you don't see any action . yes , there strip club sluttily dressed women but these aren't exactly real-looking people . just lighten up . if you don't want your 8-year-old exposed it then don't buy it him but i better not see your hipocritical ** buying him or even pg-13 movie ! this really no different than watching some pg-13 movies any movie . fact , they may worse . i think you should relax if kid 12 that generous . now enough bulls**t ! game ! it great . what else you expect ? you could play this game hours never get bored . you whatever you want : steal car , speed around town , run over people , drive-bys , rob store , kill person no reason variety weapons , see how long you evade law , mission , sub-mission ( such paramedic ) , pick up hooker get some health , etc . etc . etc . there plenty side missions those what'll take up most time , not any storyline or asset missions . hardest ones paramedic , vigilante , firefighter , brown thunder pizza boy missions far i am concerned because there you time limit if you're vehicle blows up you're f**ked start all over again . you'll take long time getting all hidden packages , rampages all stuff but that not so hard because it not something that really " hard " . just tedious . there also some race missions tough but they some persistence . controls great . driving excellent so on-foot ones . auto-aim works easily enough though you sometimes target ones you don't want , but you get around this without too much difficulty . boats harder control though helicopters tricky . but boats worst since they habit over-accelerating over-steering . but controls general good enough so you pretty quickly get used them , before you know it , you'll cruising around town like pro . graphics quite nice . cars very realistic-looking . fact , after playing this if you go outside look real cars they'll remind you ones game . you'll even feel like driving them like you game ! but obviously you won't because you're not stupid f**ked up like guy who killed those cops then like p**sy blamed game making him it . don't listen those a**holes . it all bunch crap . only complaints i would people . they could look better blood could little better too , especially when it gushes someone you shoot . i would like see more blood too . camera angles main flaw game . sometimes you'll want it point different direction so you see what you're shooting . problem when you're helicopter . get screwed up you turn around angle catch up you . foot if you're not auto-targeting you you button adjust camera angle where you're facing but when you're vehicles not so . only time this really problem though chopper . sound excellent . even sounds themselves nice . you great voice acting some well-knowns even nonwell-knowns , but it all fantastic . dialogue fantastic too . you'll hear people street talking amongst themselves they'll stuff such tell you move , sometimes not so nicely , when you park car middle flow traffic . they'll scream plead their lives or even taunt you when you point gun them or attack them . your character even say things people , like when he steals their car or kills them , such , " my need greater than yours , " or , " it only money . " it great ! humor value this game top-notch lot sounds i mentioned above , well how fun it kill people whatever reason , if there reason , but also radio ! i can't believe more people aren't commenting this . this one highpoints this game just like gta3 , only this time they don't make up all their own songs , which bad or good depending how you look it . i love cruising around town listening kchat , vrock or vcpr , latter which funniest all . i usually listen these because they funniest ( talk radio obviously funnier than music stations even though there talk dj call-in listeners commercials ) because i like rock music they play actually good bands like iron maiden anthrax . they make up some their own music . i know they make up in-game band , which you actually missions , called love fist , group drunken scotts . but radio hilarious , not just talk radio but commercials especially well ("' knife after dark'--rated ' retarded ' . " ) game some flaws but overall it d**m near perfect . makers game basically took all they gta3 added it but failed really fix these few flawss i mentioned . but they're nothing comparison overall fun this game provides . there least over 100 hours , even if you're familiar over-all gameplay gta3 , if you try 100% or least something close ( i no idea how i'm gonna complete all those submissions ) . look , this one easiest decisions you'll ever make your life . just buy d**m game . if that not enough convince you , one radio characters game , jeremy robar , says , " just listen these endorsements . remember , these people volunteered . they aren't paid much .	1
while shin megami tensei devil summoner : raidou kuzunoha vs soulless army isn't actually smt game , it member franchise . it actually part family spin-off games megaten series just using smt name establish connections different series franchise finally appearing america . while not too many people familiar games past , this one takes series new direction . devil summoner first game megaten franchise moved past traditional or tactical rpg style combat gone straight into action/rpg genre . this game you play young man who just attained title kuzunoha raidou 14th , successor long line devil summoners tasked protection capital city . his ability see control demons , raidou must solve mystery becomes increasingly more more twisted game progresses . story begins player earning raidou name ( essentially this tutorial ) assigned work detective agency capital . one day you get mysterious phonecall girl pleading help wants meet you late night . reluctantly raidou his partner detective agency head out meet her . they find out girl who contacted them odd request ; she asks them kill her . before anyone respond , she kidnapped mysterious men red so sets forth tale demons , evil , curses . essentially game progresses much way you would expect megaten game , you travel different locations via world maps explore different locations larger area maps . while wandering around areas searching clues information , there several random encounters ( franchise known high encounter rates ) allow you opportunities capture new demons aid . more later though . while exploring areas you able demon deployed follow you around ( keep mind normal people can't see it though ) . every demon type special skills used areas such flying reach far items , scouting find hidden items enemy info , even mind reading get some extra information people . these skills essential getting information you need , so it wise keep demon every type often possible . now battles . this where fans series either love game or hate it . gone pressed turn systems used nocturne digital devil saga . instead they replaced real time action battles . you directly control raidou use combinations sword strikes gun shots defeat your enemies . raidou can't use magic , so only way he deal elemental damage using special bullets . luckily him though , he able demon deployed him battle ( but only one ! ) . it typically act its own , but you capable assigning it specific orders or general strategies . using your monsters battle , they grow loyalty you . when their loyalty maxed out , they often give you bonuses then used fusions create new demons . essentailly system get little bit repetitive while it takes while get used , once you it becomes matter knowing what enemies weak which attacks . once you figure out though , it just matter keeping your levels high enough capturing fusing demons keep gaining strength . style capturing brand new well . gone negotiation system used nocturne original smt games . instead it replaced system forces you exploit enemy weaknesses . when you hit enemy element it weak too , it become stunned give you chance capture it repeatedly pressing circle until meter empties out . you must empty meter before creature revives or you not capture it . easiest way this wear down its health ahead time before attempting capture . one note though , you automatically fail capture if enemy higher level than raidou , moon full , or it boss battle . graphics music game little different what seen previous smt releases here north america . it still uses same form cel shading , but they little bit more defined detailed . nothing too major , but it enough really change visuals overall appearance other games . also , this game not dark gritty nocturne or dds . fact it several amusing scenes much brighter more vibrant overall . this greatly illustrated music which often much more lighthearted comprised lot horns brass instruments . not nearly dark brooding other two games . but since this game takes place 1920 japan not post-apocalyptic world this time , it fits quite well . overall , devil summoner new spin old franchise . while it display full action battles aren't well suited style game , atlus able it well enough it still remains fun keeps game enjoyable . lot people who found turn based systems nocturne dds overbearing cumbersome , this could nice way ease into world megaten franchise . while it not nearly epic previous games , it holds its own story alone enough keep fan franchise sated long enough finish game off regardless whether or not they like change style . definately not best game franchise , but nice refreshing change fun none less .	-1

gta series created new thresshold video games . creation gta 3 , games became increasingly more violent more controversal . san andreas no exception . if this game not bear gta tag , i probably would rated it higher , but needless say , i'm bit disappointed what rockstar this addition gta series . previous gtas all quirky jab political social icons ( particularly conversation political social icons ) . san andreas this , but much lesser extent which disappointed me . thing which disappointed me this game rpg-like system they put into it . your accuracy determined how often you practice , rather than players ablity shoot . also , unlike previous gtas , you must now press button slow your walking speed down manually aim fire gun . i hated this change gameplay . this severely limits your ablity go rampages , forces you use their god-awful auto aim system . if they not added this function game , i probably would enjoyed it lot more . said , there plenty things i enjoyed this game . first off , i enjoyed new depth theyve added missions . previously missions followed : kill this , blow up , run way these guys , avoid cops . missions this game actually feel like rockstar put lot time into each individual objective . one mission particularly comes mind mission where you hop plane , small shootout inside vehicle , then fly liberty cities ( location you cannot travel normally ) assassinate some crime bosses . little things like this show extra effort designers put into game . thing i enjoyed this game it more challengeing than previous gtas . very last mission you cussing like mad if you havent achieved fire proofing firetruck missions . this game designed skill level someone who playing gta long time . also map friggin huge ! its 3 times size your regular gta game . however , unlike previous gtas , its not packed little goodies special jumps every corner . its still fun explore every corner map this game though . so now break down my reviewpros-incredibly large map-challengeing-more new vehicles hijack-an overall improvement missions-plenty extra features-gang wars-good voice actingthe cons-new style shooting huge hinderance-areas not packed goodies before-fewer political cheap shots than sa predcisoursoverall i would give this game 8 out 10 comparison video games everywhere , but only 4 out 10 when compared its predecesors ( 5 average ) . one other note : if you ati radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game ( not lag , but actually loading game )	-1
ok so .. it really ticks me off know i'm near thirty 8 year old kid could probably destroy me games like this .. but friend mine bought me this game christmas due my obsession rabbits .. i fell love .. first tutorial level where you catch over hundred rabbits your bun gun i hooked ... like lab rabbit needing crack i hooked ! i actually beaten this game over month or so later .. but still tons missions left complete .. many new video games it set up percentages instead levels though there i guess we talk old school .... there different worlds you visit but so many missions slowly raise percentage .. so i guess you could find certain missions defeat just hurry up beat game .... but missions makes it more satisfying ... this games make me so mad i see red trying beat certain missions but other missions breeze ... but that what i love game actually challenges me .. gives me something work towards .. when you finally beat mission you really feel like you've something .. graphics amazing .. i highly suggest if you liked movie get this game .. or if you liked spongebob squarepants games such battle bikini bottom , movie flying dutchman you should get this game .. it even better dare i say !	1

half-life 2 xbox better than other shooters like halo like , because instead simply going kill , you resourceful quick witted navigate levels overcome obstacles . not mention , i loosely quote one halo developers , halo all same thirty seconds fun repeated over over . he couldn't more correct . half-life 2 , progression usually guarantees new sights , stimulates interest playing further . guns not anything incredibly original , but they well balanced some cool features . least none them need ten seconds charge make one shot effective , like ' covenant ' weapons . story , beginning absolutely riveting you work escape orwellian cruelty combine city . city itself beautifully rendered very believable , npc . alien creatures you encounter heck lot less annoying than halo flood . i think head-crabs could use work though . they look like animate rotisserie chickens ! awesome game , far better than most competition . my only major complaint vehicle levels too long repetitive , vehicle controls suck you can't see freakin ' thing . this won't kill game you , but god ski-boat level , it definitely try . anyway , if you like shooters all , buy this one .	1
my opinion yes . anyone who heard this game but doesn't fast enough computer run it ( case me ) should buy this game . gameplay inspired . there only one section midway through game where i felt transition mouse keyboard console control pad hurt game . outside one complaint graphics amazing ( xbox ) . sound design girpping atmospheric music wafts out . characters interesting well acted . everything this game top notch . anyone who says halo 2 better game quite simply idiot . halo obviously better multiplayer ( this game none ) but outside there simply nothing xbox comes close single player experience . awesome , awesome game	1
although this doesn't follow original book , it combination several stories , it holds 1930 flavor . design scenes appealing there enough puzzles throughout story . i don't know if this all dvds , but this one i keep mouse pointer half-inch or so front car order move it which sometimes proved bit annoying . playing it twice , now , i've discovered you solve clues different order still come same conclusion . nice	-1
thoroughly enjoyable game . if you like games like neverwinter nights or diablo , then this game you . lots fun ! wide selection races classes choose . i recommend this game anyone who fondness rpg style video games	1
this game awesome . i bought it reminds me show exactly . graphics best i've ever seen . i feel like i'm right there next jack , tony fighting race against time . game challenging but not challenging you can't beat it . it lot action packed levels lot options . you'll really want get this game . it definatley worth it	1
after playing big three b-ball games ' 06 ( nba live , nba 2k6 , nba ' 06 : life ) , reading reviews posted here each , i'm still not convinced much anything , other than makers these games got bunch our hard-earned dollars giving us very little far quality gaming . wit : 1 . nba live ' 06 - this series should fantastic , but seems keep taking major steps backwards every new release . horrible graphics , annoying bugs ( crash ! crash ! crash ! ) , inferior gameplay nothing new under sun . heck , instead extra like 2k6 street ball , all we've got included here lame ' retro ' live version , what ? ten years ago ? c'mon . anybody even going play this ? compare ea nba franchise their innovative exciting madden series ... not even close . i know pro football brings big bucks , nba barely close second , but ... maybe ea needs switch their development teams around next years installments ... 2 . nba ' 06 : life - ugh . nice idea , absolutely horrible , awful , crappy execution . everything other than premise garbage . speaking ... instead buying this stinker , i should've just tossed my money garbage . i can't even trade it - none secondhand dealers around pdx want take it . 3 . nba 2k6 : now here , i hope . game includes pretty much all nifty stuff i want out basketball sim , but overall package still somewhat lacking . interface not very user friendly , overall graphics look like they lifted five-year old product . i create player , but how i get player onto roster ? no clue . menu doesn't give me hint , i've pressed every button i think , no results , ' instruction ' book no help here . why , once i create player ( roster portion main menu ) , can't i use player 24/7 section game ? why i spend more time doing it all over again ? sorry guys , but player graphics game just okay ( players cutaways look like they're made out rubber , detail actual games lousy - courts nba live much more realistic , although fans here perform like , well , fans -- especially during cut sequences after ref whistle stop play ... they celebrate high five , boo bad calls , etc . courts menu graphics , however , look like something , well game five or six years ago . actual basketball ..., even though play bit more realistic than nba live , it still only adequate , using right joystick shot control worse than making guess . however ... twenty bucks , it cheapest bunch , so i didn't feel like i investing fake diamond mine africa . there so many nifty options keep this game fresh , deep sim-franchise mode 24/7 streetball mode , average gamer should happy just playing ball , rest us who've played our fair share b-ball keep some interest after dunking our way through couple seasons . i like there stats like crazy , there total control in-depth franchise simulation right down last details ( like creating your franchise gm , building custom franchise , or designing your players shoes ) , computer controlled players actually something games play like their real-life counterparts ( big men claim rebounds ! ) i love i tie up opposing teams ball-handler , ref actually call jump balls ... although i win tip , but not claim ball after ...?! commentary may best ever b-ball sim ( whatever you need keep kenny smith board this project ) rarely repetitive . i like replay player cutaways during game , crazy enough , i've missing actual halftime show ( nba live ) , instead just getting menu stats ( remember when ea used real dancer photo during halftime ? liked lot , but guess i'll take silly animated cheerleaders here instead ) . all all , i'd say this toss up two big boys . since i've played nba live franchise so long , i'd hope see ea take lesson 2k6 , make jump this level gaming simulation , then step or two further . or flip side -- 2k6 incorporate stuff ea right improve it . then maybe we'll finally basketball simulation worth twenty , or thirty , or fifty bucks we fans keep shelling out year after year ..	-1
only problem i this game . i use steering wheel it keeps locking up but game pad it doesn't . this very fun hard game play . i'm not it yet but i love cars graphics races . this really great game . there parts game where you race money , or fun all races fun play . when i need race i normally pick this game most time .	1
xbox dvd movie playback kit very easy set up use . all you plug little receiver into one controller ports , put dvd enjoy . buttons remote responsive easy get used . however , xbox dvd system very simple . it doesn't any eject buttons ( something mentioned many times other reviewers ) not many options more expensive stand-alone dvd players . you keep mind it made people who already xbox don't want shell out extra $50 dvd player lot special features when all they want able watch movie . dvd itself runs exactly it would good stand-alone dvd player . it sort like one those little $100 digital cameras . there isn't anything really special them . they just take good pictures you put your computer .	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction:i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released consoles very high quanitites , so you're likely gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available consoles very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame consular version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan	-1
if anyone played any final fantasy games then im sure they would love it . it dosent greatest graphics but it sure worth playing . only thing made me want pull out my hair how long begining !	1
bye itthis best game ever made it beats night fire long shot night fire fun 2 player game but missonssuck its best bye it	1
first off , let me say most part , katamari damacy amazing game . if you don't know story behind it , well , it wasn't thought up game designers that why it so original . game ideas came lady who didn't even like video games , they used her ideas make it . world where if you've played one rpg , you've played them all , if you've played one shooter you've played them all , etc . katamari damacy huge breath fresh air , i'm glad it popular . music strangely catchy , it great sense humor , attention detail absolutely astounding ( ton work must went into this game ) , it surprisingly very addictive fun . fact , unless you've actually played this game , you won't understand how fun addictive it . show me many games i say " i'd like " or " i wouldn't like , " but katamari damacy game you actually play understand . there even 2 player mode where you compete against friend ! you roll around " katamari " ( ball stuff ) pick up more more stuff automatically sticks your katamari . bigger your katamari gets , bigger stuff you pick up ! if this sounds stupid you , there reason : you haven't played it yet . trust me , it rocks ! while katamari damacy looks like kid game ... it not . there too much strategy , too much nuance here young minds . other hand , younger kids play chess , so .. maybe . but generally kids play stuff like halo 2 , requires little thought . my complaint level 4 . i've tried 10 times beat this level what i see , i don't think i ever able , so me game stops here . it 10 minute time limit , closest i've got 73 cm ( i need get 1 ) . i'm not gaming genius or anything , but i'm least average gamer regularly play online against other gamers very well . my opinion , they really " dropped ball " this level such strict requirement . honest , i'm really surprised anybody beaten this level , so little time . how many more times should i try ? 5 ? 20 ? 100 ? it disappointing . maybe " me my katamari " more gaming friendly ? thing , view screen isn't quite big enough . it very easy lost , so little view . you can't change camera angle , you only turn around . it would probably better bigger camera view camera changes angles automatically . also , controls turn around " charge " too difficult . turn around you press l3 r3 same time ... why not just us press button ? charge , you flip analog sticks up down really fast . too much trouble feature that pretty useless anyway . why would you want " run " when you'll just run into something anyway ? game consists lot moving back forth side , you don't need move forward fast . so it not perfect game , but it very impressive nonetheless .. i just wish i could play rest it . :(	1
i got this game my kids . one 11 one 9 . they love it . they like video conferences their friends there lot fun games it . like baseball , soccer , boxing , etc . hey this even come camera . i rated 4 stars because graffics . they not best , but still acceptible . hope this review helps	1
eye toy play 2 much better than first . while first limits what you could actually , this one very few . there much larger variety games , different activities . such running during baseball game , dodging searchlights while collecting items , chopping pickles smashing tomatoes , defeating three-headed hydra so much more . during multiplayer mode , you get take picture your face which then placed head robot monkey , which hilarious touch . also , during multi-player mode , when tie occurs , players get tie breaker form fun little mini game . downside this , if you want play minigames anytime , you force tie , which pain . downsides eye toy play 2 : some games more frustrating than challenging , instrutions booklet aren't very clear . like most eye toy games , you turn all lights nearby open curtains get decent enough lighting . even when camera set dim room . video messaging terrible . you don't get choose background like original eye toy , image small distorted . playroom difficult find , there limited ammount games , some which make no sense . like , when it asks you put brightly coloured image front camera . it just weird . overall , eye toy play 2 completely worth buy . it hours endless fun , games never seem get old	1
this game so creative . it really atypical really exciting	1
this game alot fun you get play whole lot ofplaces , explore beat pepole up . finishing game easyexpecially when you play multiplayer . only parts arehard where you haft beat fairygodmother theend . some levles you might find boring like one three little pigs . so i would recommend you buy this acheap price !	1
i loved this game . it well made insanely broad what you could it . if you aren't phased fantasy violence then you'll probably think game lot fun too . but i never let my children come within 10 feet this game you probably shouldnt either . here why . i fitting retitle this game would " scarface : game " because that what great deal this game modeled after , extremely violent movie drug lord . game takes place realistic coastal city . there restaurants , beaches , hospitals , hotels , police depts , grocery stores , bars , gas stations . fact game modeled after locations sights found movie scarface . city populated pedestrians , golfers , shoppers , people waiting get buses/in cabs , hookers , gang members , strippers , drug dealers , policemen , emergency medical technicians , bums , store cashiers , etc . you kill any one these people . you solicit prostitute , then run over her your car she gets out leaves , then take money back you paid her . you watch strip show then shoot stripper . you hack pedestrian up chainsaw . throw cab driver out his cab then run him over it . you perform drive-by shootings . you start gang war . you walk up car , aim rifle innocent driver shoot them directly head watch them fall out driver seat . you drive around inside shopping center run over shoppers . you distribute flyers adult films you're producing . you even start massacre shooting then emt come help people , blow them up rocket launcher , or simply beat them death baseball bat . you become such threat city national guard may appear tanks , helicopters , infantry . yes you kill them too . you don't all this stuff . fact almost none it necessary completing main point game . you simply freedom it if you desire o.o you could simply go through basic missions game involve ex-con rise power leader powerful mafia-type drug cartel la , you guessed it , scarface . your kid probably love it . all all , what it , it extremely well made . course if you worried violence etc found video games could negatively affect your child , then you should no means let them anywhere near it	1
this second elder scrolls game i've played , first oblivion . i really enjoyed oblivion decided give this one try , i must say i've really enjoyed it so far . still main quest , though right now i'm gonna join morag tong . now first off , if you're impatient type , or really easily confused , then this game not you . this game takes time patience really enjoy . one thing i when i first started playing ; i paid attention what people said went where i told go . i know it game really gives you freedom what you want , but someone just starting out series , just follow main quest line make sure pay attention what people say , just go where you need . then , once you've become more accustomed how things work , then i'd suggest exploring some . you'll often come across people roads quests they'll want give you that'll often deviate your current objective . i would actually suggest helping them out , journal often enough get you back track afterwards . just remember stay roads , look every sign you come across so you know which way go . closing , if you patience willing put some serious time into game , then i'd suggest getting this . it older game , graphics clearly outdated , but it quite enjoyable experience . fact , i'm liking it more than oblivion , which my attention few months . no telling when i'll this one	1
this game great . my 4 year old enjoys trying keep up gets super excited whenever she gets . i love this when i don't feel like going gym . it great fun quick sweat . thirty minutes this your ! my workout buddy came over dinner last week my daughter wanted her play . i told her play her workout , she didn't think it would make her sweat . but oh boy she sweating quickly . only con this controllers , if i could just get good enough not land wire box . i am shopping around new one right now .	1
i love this game . i haven't played other ddr games before , so i'm not sure how it compares others , but this one great . some songs i like lot , some i don't , but they're all challenge fun some way . i like use dance master mode which you unlock songs doing well . i haven't made it all far because i play same levels over over again because they're so fun . this game great people all ages , includes music young old .	1
unfortunately it too short easy lack depth game . story mode bit weak , however they make up classic mode . what else great this game its still highly addicting even after year use , while most others forgettable month or two after purchase . i reccomend you buy this rather than thug1 or thaw . i garantee you enjoy this game while	1
i liked this game . i mean final fantasy vii still god final fantasy game but this ok	1
ffvi end-all best game ever created . story line simply out this world . game grips you beginning never lets go . interaction main characters incredible . game creates most haunting mood any game ever released , despite now primitive graphics sound . i gone years without playing game before but story , environments , villains even some music would still stand out my mind . this game simply leaves impression you unlike any other video game ever could . after playing through it , every other game out there just seems void content . no other final fantasy installment touch this one ( ffvii distant second ) . this likely remain best game ever created unless it completely remade today technology , but even questionable snes graphics give incredible atmosphere game anyway . my only complaint this particular title result its adaption playstation . new cinema cut scenes not come even remotely close doing this game justice . some sound didn't carry over well either , addition load times isn't exactly welcome one . despite these shortcomings , it still complete game , which all matters . ffvi absolutely breathtaking every aspect when it released , remains so this day . story , music , characters gameplay still better than anything today games offer . anyone who yet experience this incredible adventure only keeping themselves one most engaging stories ever	1
this game great ! it easy get stuck beginning , but after you get off train , it goes really fast . this one , nancy train might haunted . lori girard ( your host ) invites bunch people , including frank joe hardy ( you actually get play frank one part game ) . then odd things start happening train : lori disappears apparently thin air , then train emergency brake pulled . this really fun game !	1

i love way this game gives you freedom walk around everywhere . you over 15 different weapons which makes gameplay far more interesting than i'd ever imagined . you change into different clothes which actually important helping you progress through game . it not normal style gameplay , but interesting one say least . while it hardly best game you find market , it certainly unique	1
i went my local game store buy game get me into christmas spirit . obviously when i asked christmas game first thing woman behind counter said " polar express .

this game just freakin ' awesome . im not big into video games , i really only play them when i someone play against ... i stay away one player mode because i get bored cannot talk smack . then came duty . i played this game through all difficulty modes , medium up never got bored . plus , if you've got nice group folk play way separate screens prevent looking , multiplayer sweet ( esp if you break up into teams ) you talk smack all day long . best graphics gameplay any game ive ever seen	1
only flaw i find this game multiplayer isn't very much fun . playing locally friend means you just shoot him lot while he learns controls . no enemy ais maps	-1
... me . let me explain , oh my friends ! little history . started playing shooters pc when i youngin ' . quake first . quake ii followed . iii . unreal . unreal tournament . few lesser titles . all multiplayer , mind you . since i kid , there always something so ( divinely ) mind boggling able link up different machines ( time computers ) not only participate , but kill your friends , ultra cool weapons like , -- literally -- universe outside our own . , truly -- there anything cooler ? it like psychically connecting your friends lucid dream , only peppered concrete universe filled its own physics laws . point divuldging into this intimate joy mine paper (?) ? ever since i've introduced this experience ' multiplayer ' , i pretty much neglected single player all games like deformed foster child epilepsy . so why ' call duty 2 ' xbox 360 revolutionary gamer such myself ? it converted me . what , you ask ? pc , console . i defiantly backed my beliefs -- console could not ( hadn't -- objective fact i'd say ! ) come close pc regards multiplayer gaming . first person shooters only solidified argument . one , you've got mouse , which undeniably offers more precise degree control . i played mario brothers controller , but after playing ' goldeneye ' nintendo 64 whenever i attended friends house way back when , i shuddered disgust . controller couldn't touch what i used , not mention fact you're playing full screen computer , very accomplished speed , opposed split screen console , which , one dared play four player , reached framerates dire levels , not unlike viewing screenshots ' net ( i exaggerate only slightly ) . so here comes ' call duty 2 ' xbox 360 . starters i only bought system because friend convinced me i actually impulsive it , which i'm usually not . ' project gotham racing ' while which actually pretty fun online , if bit hard , i never into racing games . few weeks later i bought duty , i impressed . let me just say off bat many know , first many months game existence online play would become unplayable when certain amount people clogged server . sometime back now , however , guys finally released patch game now works well it possibly could . now , this why game refuses let me abandon it : - graphics very good , perhaps more importantly , framerate excellent . reoccuring problem among past console shooters ( halo halo 2 prayed it could touch 60 frames per second like cod2 ) yet overcome , we now finally game runs silky smooth 95% time , practically unaffected number players screen or viewing distance larger levels . it gloriously smooth , i am completely obsessive this sort thing . add this graphical prowess ( which too stunning despite overall -- but my opinion inconsequential -- semi-lack detail textures ) , you've got gaming universe good go even most demanding lowlife . - control -- great help consistent framerate -- good . once you've gotten used it , it radiates . best i've used console , beating out even halo ( which i dabbed bit via friends ) due again huge improvement rendering speed graphics . it becomes intuitive but constant ability probe deeper into skill level . i personally play ' high ' sensitivity setting while i'm still not good i would mouse ( theorhetically ) , i am good -- far better than i could ever imagined controller . - net code delicious . even pings up 2-300 ( kind stretching it ) , you -- very -- little disadvantage over even host . because way it works , you aren't shooting it shoot . 2 seconds later . however it it , it , but it compensates latency there practically no unfair play result . this whole point immense value because awesome graphics speed netcode offers essentially no determent any kind . overall , this all adds up near-perfect online gaming experience good any i've played pc ... just stunning . oh yeah , xbox live interface whole friend dealie ? brilliant . get friends seconds any point time . microphone course adds greatness already great experience . - game . it fun anything . weapons awesome . sound effects blast make totally satisfying kills . everything well balanced , despite fact lesser skilled players say snipers outweigh all other weapons . maps overall wonderfully designed dynamic . personally i'm still into standard modes play ( there five ) -- deathmatch team deathmatch -- they riot . it all works , beautifully . it fun , so fun , consequently become like powerful drug . hmmm . so yeah , five stars without any hesitation whatsoever , based simply multiplayer . it one game never , second , made me regret purchase 360	1
i think this great game my wife i currently addicted it . it definitely more simcity style play than civilization series ; though it allows more granular control your city than simcity . only civilization aspect research which enjoyable . but other than there isn't much " civ " civcity ( which isn't necessarily bad ) . this game reminds me heavily german title " knights merchants " ( 1998 ) but much better implementation . note , if you find this game isn't you , try very similar but much easier " glory roman empire " . this game definitely challenging , but good way . someone complained small maps - maps get bigger your progress through game small maps small reason - it adds challenge game ( example , there island map limited resources which requires you build shipping fleet ) . interface generally good , but there some non-intuitive things like sending tributes . i think graphics nice , especially temples , but it definitely not end-all far graphics go . there lot city beautification enhancements ( fountains , gardens , etc ) i don't tend mess , but they pretty increase your city happiness . ( your citizens candidly tell you if they think your city " dump " . i think they excellent job citizen interaction - amusing yet useful . ) regarding " game breaking " click-select bug . i'm playing 1024x768 resolution i barely any problems it . when i , i simply rotate my map i'm able select what i want . i don't consider bug " game breaking " or even all annoying ; though i'm glad they're coming out patch fix it . all all , i think game play excellent . like all modern games , implementation rushed ( nothing patch won't fix , though ) . i suspect game age well high-replay value	1

i purchased nintendo ds specifically this game not disappointed . i'm 65 good day get my " brain age " into 30s . i gave game ds 80 year-old friend , she get into 40s . we both struggle test calls memorizing list words . after learning play sudoku brain age , i switched playing it my palm pilot ( game astraware ) which lets me enter game daily newspaper . i've recently lent my ds 6th grader who learning sudoku . ( way , avoid ds game called " sudoku " . it unnecessarily clunky entering data . ) this appropriate game seniors who like math/logic challenges even if they've never used computer . plan spend some time tutoring newbie , then watch he or she enjoys challenge	1
thinking . analyzing . solving problems . reading . logic . these just some skills brain age help you develop ( or re-develop ) . no , it not resident evil or splinter cell . but it fun addictive ; it certainly challenging if not more challenging , it nice pallet cleanser plethora pure entertainment value games my kids i play . brain age bit advanced times my grade schoolers , but parts they get really help them develop skills they concurrently working school . big brain academy much easier ( not better ) alternative younger children . there daily training area gives your skills workout . there test area challenges you quickly accurately work through various tasks , then provides you calculation your brain age based how well you test . sudoku it own area train brain number logic . kids reading this no vote me death saying this , but this great game parents get their kids . it one only ones ( big brain academy other ) i never take away my own kids when they've misbehaved or simply just too much video gaming . they never complain . one word advice : brain age hard time recognizing " 8 " if you write it way you'd skate figure 8 ; it likes it better when you draw 8 two circles top each other . addictive fun . buy it .	1
red steel lives up all hype - if you give it chance . when i first played game , controls difficult awkward . this due most actions carried out movements controllers , rather than pressing buttons . after i got hang it , game excelled . it best control scheme possible console first-person shooter , very much akin using keyboard mouse . if you're bad shot game , it because you're bad shot real-time aiming , not because you can't point finicky joystick right direction . sword combat amazing , mapping your actual movements much closer than zelda . again , it takes some getting used , but this due fact red steel breaking entirely new ground terms how play game this type . voice acting superb . characters who lived america very realistic american accent . japanese security guards very thick accent , which appropriate , due spending most their lives japan only traveling america start game . sato , who very wealthy japanese man business connections america , appropriately much more understandable english , but japanese influence still clear his speech patterns . sound effects amazing , especially considering how interactive levels . sounds effects piped through wiimote very realistic , when compared sound effects zelda . graphics nothing write home , if you compare them hi-def xbox 360 ps3 . however , if you let them stand they play game , you'll soon sucked . there really very little complain , unless you insist emphasizing it not bleeding edge technology . all all , game very well-made enjoyable , if you fan first-person shooters .	1
anyone who fan black isle games based infinity engine should enjoy this game . they changed up character creation little , so you seemingly more control over your character strengths weaknesses . while iwdii doesn't depth torment or npc interaction baldur gate series , it still good story nice interface . graphically it subpar nwn series , but i think might actually benefit , i found 3d aspect nwn hinderence times . some tips those interested : 1 . make party 4 characters . they level up faster less hang ups ai . 6 members , i found i needed start over import them into new game after prologue because they under powered , 2 them always end up wandering off me . those problems abated only 4 characters . 2 . multiclassing key . thief abilities nice , but you don't really need more than 3 or 4 levels rogue . sink all points into picking locks , traps . multiclass into ranger or mage . you won't worry armor hindering thief skills . adding few levels fighter cleric or barbarian helps learn more weapon skills , case cleric , boost hp . these just few ideas ... 3 . warriors , focus only couple differnt weapons . make sure you least one them blunt weapons , some foes aren't vulnerable bladed variety . also , least 2 members competent ranged weapons	1

( ff1 - 10 , 10-2 , ff tactics ) . i would say this ff xii best gameplay final fantasy i ever dream off since my childhood . i summarize follows . 1 . game play : i would rate this 10 stars but here max just 5 . game looks boring first , but once you get party a.i. system ( called gambit game ) , this extremely fun . battle environment superb . looks much like real battle . no battle scene . no random battle . everything appears map . multiple attacks land enemy same time . camera view half-global ( you see everything , if there no obstacle , front , behing , left , right , above , not below though since floor obstacle . ) this like real thing . thing i want see final fantasy ! 2 . graphic : superb . rendered texture looks inferior ff ff x-2 , when these two highest quality cutscene displayed . but over all cut scene better since ff x-2 , there sometimes cutscene looks really bad . i am more satisfied something smoothly good average , not too good cutscene then extremely bad times . 3 . music : superb . thus far , no normal battle music , but not matter . music not so great when you listen separately , but it suits game environment lot . 4 . trivia : town so huge . look like real town . approximately more than 50-100 people you talk each town . costume looks so different . it not just like old series this game where town person town may looks exactly alike town if you notice . but ff xii , you notice meticulously see similarity . overall , everyone looks unique ! thing i would say environment looks much like star wars + lord rings , though i put more emphasis former . if you watch star wars episode i , you see why i think it looks much like star wars . cons : i would say these cons nothing compared pros . 1 . storyline . quite simple . no plot twist thus fat i played . not many things stimulate players want know what happen next . unlike ffx , game introduced many interesting plots beginning gradually unraveled them game proceeded . i would say if you watch only movies cutscene , ffxii sounds like normal battle story middle age . ( but why there so many hi-tech transportation ? )2 . voice . i would say voice actors this game quite disappointing . they good job , i admitted , but their voices doesn't seem sound good . example , compared ff , main female protagonist unique voice , but ff xii sounds like typical american people . second main female protagonist ff sounds unique , but ffxii sounds ok , not so great . main antagonist ff sounds mysteriously great , but ffxii sounds quite dull . only one i think he sounds ok main male protagonist .	1
godfather : game allows you live godfather movies . storyline characters pertains movies very well . missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving , driving more driving ! but overall if your fan godfather like i am , you wont care . ( respect family !	1
intro . i know some people ( if i may quote other reveiwer , mr. ., ) think this game ' not easy normal humans ' , but seriously , it good game ! don't base it whether level or two challenging . would you like it better if it piece cake ? i sure heck wouldn't . ( fair , i some trouble levels : rift river , some parts planetarium , etc . ) gameplaytak 2 plays very nicely , far games go . environments animals people so nicely , levels varied , not like you're one area whole game . music easily listenable , not like some other obnoxious video game music , example kingdom hearts traverse town music . ( forigve me ! ) fighting system basically button mashing beginning , but it develops you get new juju powers learn combo attacks . i also enjoyed animal changing parts game ... true , some parts unbeliveably annoying ( like when you're flying squirrel , juju runs out you plummet your death kind annoying . ) but i still liked idea able change into bears , squirrels , frogs , boars . this game graphics animators credit . it awesome how tak moves look so realistic when he water , or mud , or tipetoeing , or jumping , or whatever . pros conspros : 1 . amazing animation2 . funny dialouge3 . once , game good music4 . nice fighting system5 . awsome animal changes6 . just darn fun play beat ! cons : 1 . some really hard killer levels ... i ton trouble darts gloomleaf swamp ... bleh . 2 . few glitches bugs this game . 3 . augh ! loading times!overalli'd definitely say buy it , if not rent it . it really fun ton replay value	-1

original lego star wars great little lighthearted romp game : amusing way play out three most recent star wars films virtual form . lego star wars combo proved also terrific formula game space , generating experience lego star wars oftentimes even more entertaining than source material it based . like any good sequel , lego star wars ii improves original almost every way . but most importantly , it good episodes now . reason alone , lego star wars ii one most enjoyable games this fall . featuring story lines characters new hope , empire strikes back , return jedi , it hard believe any star wars fan ( which , what , pretty much everyone ? ) wouldn't love this game . while gameplay pretty standard action fare most part , it somehow made so much more fun because lego characters . levels could perhaps dismissed lackluster other games absolutely work here . star wars scenes comically recreated look sound great ( though , nitpick , some john williams music samples don't play their entirety , making you wish more ) . but make no mistake , even those without predilection star wars enjoy this -- it combination great story lines , characters , comedic elements provided lego makes it all work . game designers clearly fun it all -- you'll continuously entertained how they incorporated elements film into gameplay ( often taking some rather humorous liberties way ) . lego brand clearly afforded them freedom fun star wars license . while most gameplay consists run-and-gun action , there lots puzzles found -- many which quite good , even though some rather unclear objectives -- several missions take place vehicles ( at-st walkers x-wings ) . while vehicular stages vary terms quality , mere fact so many exist really adds scope game . lego star wars ii offers surprising amount playtime , much larger longer than original game ( which one its biggest criticisms ) . once again , you control group characters pertain scene , allowing you easily switch them fly order take advantage their unique abilities . unfortunately , though , your . i . -controlled buddies kind clueless times offer little support battles ( while they fire , it all show -- their shots inflict no damage enemies ) . game far better when second player joins play ( game joined any time ); it loads fun o-o experience . it just shame lego star wars ii offers no online support . what also neat game there lot outside standard mission structure . there lots collectables gather , secret items discover , hidden areas unlock ( certain areas aren't immediately accessible first playthrough -- only return using other characters they opened ) . option build your own custom characters parts taken others ( such c-3po equipped darth vadar head ) amusing well . there definitely lot fun lego star wars ii , making it good choice those looking solid action-platformer ; it ideal choice those fans star wars . it also perfect almost all ages , offering rewarding experience even younger players . all many versions ( xbox 360 , ps2 , pc , xbox , gamecube , psp ) look essentially same , pc version offering better resolutions xbox 360 version more visual effects ( though it unfortunately priced $10 more than others ) . rumor it developers traveller tales more lego games works after this ( including one based batman ) -- here hoping , this formula simply works .	1

back when it came out xbox , i incredibly angry ... i only silly gameboy ... but when it came out computer , i just it . i found game very fun play , simple controls ( use arrows , not wasd ) felt very fufilled credits finally rolled after last battle . it doesn't take long finish this game , but play continuous ( if you watch entire credits ) you always start over switch evil/good side new version game	1
i would 5 this one all way , because i enjoyed game immensly ( general idea game ) , but because personal preference i stopped playing it because excessive gore , sexual/debasing themes , leud art . if you like this game but don't want all questionable material ( yes , i know it nothing compared other games ) then may i recommend " fate " wildtangen	1
this best game made xbox - well worth money	1
i love this game i bought this game 3 times	1
this game good . it excellent story-line , great graphics , innovative battle system , but it extremely difficult . it took me months beat it , i honestly can't recommend it . there too much involved beating it really make me say it worth it	-1

i know , i know . but i playing online since days text-based mudds . most you reading this way too young even know what mudd , but back 1982 , we playing them . yes , i said 1982 . i've playing online games just long seen evolution just every type online game environment you think . i've played battle.net, heat.net just every other online gaming service ( free or subscription-based ) there play over last 20 years . many you may not even know what xcite means , but they responsible online gaming 16-bit systems ( sega genesis super nintendo ) . i those too . amp ; quot ; so after playing online nigh 20 years , i ask myself what earth xbox live ( xbl ) going so much more better it than any other online experience than i ever , amp ; quot ; this what i thinking before i signed up , i very skeptical rightfully so . but once i playing , my tune changed rather quickly . all years i playing online , there simply no single experience fun , exciting solid xbl experience ( yes , even ps2 online experience inferior xbl ) . it quite safe say , they last 20+ years online gaming ultimately leading up xbl . microsoft taken all best attributes online gaming infused them into xbl , while leaving all worst attrtributes cutting room floor . check this out , they constantly improving experience . while you xbl subscription , all upgrades service free charge . we get upgrades improvements every few months . xbl experience so good , many even pc gaming communittee prefer xbl over pc online gaming clamouring get xbl pc - later this year , they finally it . then there all tons free stuff you get xbl . i cannot remember just how many new levels modes maps soundtracks various xbl games i downloaded last year absolutely free . almost 100 games available use service number looking more than double itself end 2004 , that just even more opportunities downlaod more free stuff my xbox harddrive . inconclusion , xbl really best online gaming there ever date . however , you not take my word it , you find out yourself absolutely free . most xbl games these days come 2-month trial card free game box . just use sign-up temporary account you get full access all xbl services free two whole months . that two whole months full access best online gaming service ever created . if then you feel this not you , then you free cancel service without further obligation . you cannot lose . anyway , i play xbl everyday , i hope see some you there soon .	1
while i only own one game ds , what makes it so great wifi ability play friends . i spent couple afternoons friend house several other people , all playing mario kart against each other , it fun time full excitement people yelling , either knocked back 1st dead last , or managing squeeze out win last second . touch screen also great addition ds . some games allow either touch screen or standard controls used , depending preference . others , like mario kart , stick standard controls , others require use just touch screen , creating very unique kind game . lite also improvement first ds . while it may not worth it upgrade if you already first ds , it worth it if it your only ds . lite better shaped , better battery life , better , brighter screens . ds lite certainly great handheld console	1

this collection isn't bonus feature happy anthology . this version ff4 ( 2 usa time snes/genesis era ) hasn't changed much . random battle loading screen like snes version , switch field/world map character menu while loading fast hell ( while sadly chrono trigger slower than 2 ff games anthology collection even slower than other final fantasy games psone era ( 7 , 8 , 9 )) chrono trigger lot bonus features this version . squaresoft ( time ) put *** load cinemas ( mainly ending cinemas ) , list music game , other stuff . gameplay still same , exception what i said earlier , which good otherwise . unlike anthology , this collection no bonus music cd ( those who care anyway ) . this still worth owning anyway	1
quite honestly i think it expected original would better than second especially series such this where you choose what happens plot ( light or dark side ) . first game series such this its easier write plot run smoothly because you clean slate but second game you cant really make it so it runs so smoothly . you make game so it runs smoothly no matter which path you chose first game which i think pretty difficult task . they ok this task but times actual story line quite confusing but overall they ok . i think they better job powers such . you able get lot higher level then you previous game so you received more powers . game not awful any means . i think if you play game knowing its not going live up kotor 1 you enjoy it quite bit more . i recomend you play first kotor before playing this one because then you see series its full potential appreciate it lot more . also know it not going good kotor 1 when you start playing , it helps quite bit	-1
this truly amazing game , especially considering it made small independent developer . there virtually infinite number different unit types , spells magic items so game never gets repetitive ( this possible * because * it doesn't rely massive amounts graphics ) . different nations each their own style play . ai challenging even when set " easy " . you download new maps other modifications internet . i only reduced rating 4 because problems interface . it sort unfinished feel it . example when game ends , it always exits windows rather than main menu . also , running multiplayer game very difficult requires executing two instances game simultaneously	1

my expertise actually rpg but i've always madden fan so i think my opinion usefull someone wanting know this game . this your classic madden game . very fun , very addictive , very challenging . franchise mode best feature . basically you pick your team then you decide how much pay players order keep under salary cap , which players dump rehire pretty much everything else it takes run team ( which lot things ) . then their online mode where you play players all over country . after you play all other modes this feature keep you entertained clear until next madden game comes out . only problem some online players know how cheat . ea sports strongly denies it possible cheat online , many good players get mad when someone talks cheaters online because good players think people who blame other cheating just sore losers ( which true lot time ) . however , after personally seeing some things my computer nerd brother hack into i think anything possible any website . there ton people out there lot smarter than you me they figure out how cheat anything ! finally only reason made me drop my rating 5 star overall 3 star overall . infamously not so popular superstar mode . super star mode sucks !!!! you retry foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr get pedigree parents you want . top you can't fully get your player high rating all categories make good player ( speed , agility , strenth etc . ) . you improve player stats , but never where you eventually want get them . also , when you finally get agent get you access performance institute it doesn't much good because using performance institue only increases your stat temporarily . but i some good news ! i've heard through grapevine madden 07 this feature greatly improved . you'll able run 40 yard dash so you acually get speed rating higher than lousy 88 . you get bench rep decide your own strength . so least madden 07 you'll more control your player skills . this best thing madden . people who make these madden games must took notes when they learned evolution school . every year madden adapts improves flaws last year game ( much like what football coaches their team real life ) . cool thing they actually take advice their fanbase ( unlike most game companies ) . when madden comes across problem they adapt fix problem . this game probably deserved 4 star overall rating instead 3 star overall rating , but when video game company adds new feature game it better cool . because it really pisses me off if they go through trouble add new feature get us all really excited then new feature ends up beeing stupid .	1
i big fan first kingdom hearts , it truly unique game . melding worlds final fantasy disney very interesting idea , its one worked . kingdom hearts ii continues same basic formula , so if you liked original , you most definetly dig this one . everything oringinal well , ii improves . combat system vast improvement over original , it remains fun over 30+ hours . fact , i wish there more experience . its fun . if your disney fan , you dig able fight different disney characters explore those worlds . all very well diverse , some particular just breathtaking . pirates carribean world comes mind , its just awesome . you actually feel like your apart world you fight captain jack sparrow . voice acting animations add too immersive nature . its amazing how well they get johnny depp character , you would think it his him game , when he actually nothing production . square characters get some great treament game well , you run into many them . you'll even fight side some them thats treat well . if your final fantasy fan , you absolutly eat up more ff inspired moments game , it more than makes it worthwhile experience if your not into disney . real draw me story . one best most moving stories i've ever pleasure playing . its very interesting actually . surprisingly , you start game not playing sora . you play roxxas first 5 or so hours . it serves introduction world , but roxxas key character story , you blast playing him . thing i liked story wraps up quite well , you not left hanging . it satisfying conclusion , much better than first games ending . square enix once again shows why they one best business . kingdom hearts ii very polished product , art style , character designs , music , down extremely well fmv . its not without flaws , it tad short me , i finished it under 35 hours , it supposed much longer . but regardless , its incredible journey well worth devoting time play	1
best friends , lydia celeste separated eight years ago when , after death her mother , celeste father became director far-off dragonvale academy . now lydia start her first day student magic dragonvale looks forward reunited her friend . but when she arrives , she finds academy deserted except one odd character : wolf who claims dragon . where everybody ? what going here ? this wolf really trusted ? these just some questions you must answer you explore school . keepsake , first game canadian wicked studios , lovely 3d point click adventure tradition syberia . i mean " lovely " literally : first thing strike you beauty environments . castle ornate knotwork motifs colour themes , making exploration pleasure . there isn't lot animation , but what there well ; water effect especially nice . characters slightly less well-realised , but still quite good . sound also quite good . music beautiful , different haunting motif each character section castle . f/x somewhat limited bit repetetive : lots footsteps bird calls , fire water sounds , etc . however , they fit well design rest game , so i can't complain . i'm very surprised see so many complaints here dialog . i really saw nothing wrong it or voice acting . rather , conversation used explain points not necessarily elucidated action ( philosophy magical system , example ) well develop characters their relationships . i considered good writing , not opposite . game starts cute little tutorial , which one other game characters leads you through controls . i kind liked , i dislike reading manuals it obviated need kind introductory sequence you find lot games this type ; you coul just jump right . puzzles quite mix : several straight " games , " couple mechanical , including one that quite involved , some riddle-type , some inventory , kind slider , huge maze ( not counting castle itself , ) . there no timed puzzles you can't die . i liked way inventory worked : once you acquired requisite item , it automatically used relevant spot . so you didn't keep opening your inventory , picking up item , clicking it hotspot , etc . rest , they fairly straightforward ... except riddle-type . clues provided so obscure i can't believe anyone but designers could possibly make sense them . fortunately , game includes hint feature , which give three hints each puzzle , after which it offers solve puzzle you . i use " solve " feature once , when even clues explained didn't much enlighten me . but when you use " solve " feature , you don't actually get see solution , just result it . so i still don't know what puzzle ! hint feature also tell you if you don't prerequisistes necessary continue puzzle . if you use it when you're not puzzle-view , it clarify your next objective . i found both these aspects very helpful . i experience one bizarre glitch game : intervals , without reason or warning , sound would suddenly start stutter echo most annoying way . adjusting game settings no effect . i eventually discovered i could correct problem exiting game rebooting my computer . this seemed necessary once every couple hours . i completed keepsake 25 hours -- possibly little more . i deligthed it kept me busy so long most adventure games these days barely provide 10 hours play . some second part game get little draggy , lot toiling back forth through castle . however , keepsake good choice gamers who like straight adventure fantasy context . but glitch couple illogical puzzles , i would given it five stars . i eagerly look forward wicked studios ' next effort	-1

i just got my wii i bought zelda which given , i also purchased monkey ball because great reviews rating . main game very addicting very challenging , but i also thought monkey ball would mainly great mini games i wrong . although i read ign review they said if they would 15 goood mini games instead 50 , it would smarter . overall , main game makes this game worth while purchase while mini game just adds little feature so if you buying this game sole purpose mini games , try rayman ! yes , controls horrible lot mini games . but i'm still glad i got it , me my friend take turns playing main game it gets really challenging	1

intro . jak 3 ending jak daxter trilogy , i say it pulled it off quite nicely . there few flaws game , but nothing major . you start out jak , now exile haven city because people who distrust him his dark powers . he taken people wasteland story continues there . gameplayonce again , jak moves very fluidly nicely exact same controls last game ( except certain new powers like light jak ) . , once again , animators wonderful job making lush , detailed landscape characters . sunsets sunrises well , nothing looks cut pasted walls , like spyro-era games . i like way this game you get move haven city wasteland . this way you get even more terrain explore than last game . additionally , you get control light jak powers ! i thought this nice twist nice way add something new people who enjoyed dark jak option . one thing personally irks me ... they took away keira voice actor ! she barely speaks when she , it not same person . least other keira role ! also , ending felt little dragged out towards end game , i just hoping it would finish soon instead prolonging it more crammed-in missions . pros conspros : 1 . nice characters2 . no glitches so far3 . no loading times4 . detailed landscape5 . new powers old : dark jak light jak6 . good switches areascons : 1 . blasting people or monsters over over get annoying . 2 . ending seemed go pace snail . overalla nice finish series ! if you bought first two , you'll most definitely drawn this one anyway . :	1
best thing this generation consoles complete wireless experience . controllers very well made feel solid your hands , battery life solid 20 hours rechargeable batteries , they work across house . i would recommend purchasing either play charge kit or charging station save you money batteries	1
controller excellent but some reason creator put four little knots controller joystick i no ideal why but if you use this controller play fast paced game like boxing watch out , because tips your thumb hurt , i am talking real pain . it takes fun out game you playing . i would give this controller 5 star rating if it wasn't 4 knots joystick , hopefully more people complain they remove them . this shows developers don't play games long enough	-1

mario luigi partners time me takes me back snes , first mario rpg " super mario rpg : legend seven stars " game i absolutely love ( would also recommend anyone snes or emulator ) . reason general gameplay this rpg hasn't changed . you move around different screens , attack enemies , fight bosses , etc . there definately unique ( i suppose you might consider it simplistic ) ideology this game follows . it easier version action/rpgs , you level up , battles aren't random ( you see enemies you engage screen ) though it turn-based . this game plays feels much like original legend seven stars , but added its own twists funny little story line make it , it own game . i highly recommend this game anyone who doesn't mind lot chatting , but even more action puzzles ! homerun mario rpgs	1
this hands down best star wars game i played or seen . just fact you use almost every hero villian star wars movies makes this blast play . addition space combat what really tips scales this title . when you're flying through waves tie fighters you land imperial star destroyer begin fighting through control rooms , you begin realize this game really special .	1
i bought this game whim ; i am not spyro fan . first few hours , i found it quite enjoyable . it colorful graphics , cool moves , even some humorous aspects . unfortuneately , it unbelievably frustrating . i'm quite skilled platformers , but this game required perfect timing , accuracy , etc . all this led lot anger my part . still , i might managed work through it ... if it hadn't broke ! yes , that right : when i tried turn it again , xbox refused read my saved file . i must admit , i no desire start over . eventually , i sold this game ... my xbox . sorry , vivendi ; sorry , bill gates . you'll both come up something less faulty next time	-1
i thought there could more some story line . i'v playing gta vice city san andreais , like stoury line . but overall i pleased game	-1

i just grabbed ds yesterday , this my first game it . square really amazing job remaking famicom classic . first couple seconds i put-off pixelated fmv opening scenes , but i soon overtaken style which they executed . aside obvious audio-visual updates , gameplay really well adapted ds . me , game actually far more fun play stylus than d-pad . others mentioned game may challenging some . however , it really isn't bad . keys fight intuition pay attention what townspeople tell you . instance , near beginning game , you must venture into cave filled undead monsters . they seriously whip your arse before you 100 hp or so unless you realize you cast cure them , they all die one round ( villager nearby area mentions this fact ) . then you get bunch experience gain several levels quickly , cave becomes quite easy complete . this type strategy helps keep game moving smoothly . you just know repeatedly pressing a-button or tapping screen during battles won't cut it way it some rpgs . happy gaming !! :)	1
i honestly don't see why square enix hasn't thought doing this all their older final fantasy games , really . it would definitely appeal newer final fantasy audiences who grownup all 3-d games(all while , giving them good history lesson ff games ) yet appeal us older final fantasy fans its ' old school style . i liked it better when stories simpler follow . that not say i dislike newer final fantasy games , though . things change through years i i love those games just much . game starts off you(luneth ) assembling team heroes(arc , refia , ingus ) restore balance world . this , you must choose jobs(23 all ) help aid you your quest . every battle you play through add each character job level so you'll want use thought building not only your characters main level , but also their job proficiency well . although final fantasy iii very challenging game , it also entertaining one . i wish nintendo ds more rpgs this style . i simply couldn't get enough game kept finding myself fighting one more battle whatnot before putting it down . you'll explore lands , man boat , pilot airship , ride chocobo , find treasure , more . not only but game simply beautiful . i agree , it simply better overall experience 3-d . all all , you're looking rpg clocks around 50/60 hour mark depending how you play . new side quests moogle mail , you'll bit more play . final fantasy iii ds gem shouldn't missed .	1
i played this game up through 6th colossus . game just keeps drawing me . i want see next colossus , find out what happens next . other reviewers said , these colossi enourmous . finding out how kill them challange but game give you hints if you get stuck . i can't say it terribly difficult game , but me , spending tons time figure out how advance game turn off . definately worth buying !!	1
let me begin saying this not game children . what makes this game unique , separates it madden series , training camp option . train your players , use steroids , x-ray those bone crushing injuries . overall , pretty good sports game	-1

this game way more like vice city than san andreas , so anyone expecting see character who eat , go gym etc , disappointed . san andreas revolution history all gaming , this solid game too , but minus revolution . you get all fun vice city basically , which means cop bribing , law breaking , pedestrian harming havoc . sad fact you not climb , swim or fly there no jetpack ! d'oh!the graphics poor storyline not good i would hope but remember this psp port ! it also only 20 bucks , so give it try , if you liked vice city lot , then you like this one	1
grand theft auto series playstation 2 gone hand hand , which each game debuting ps2 before it travels other consoles . all changed release last year side story , grand theft auto : liberty city stories . this game , designed take advantage psp hardware , impressive technical feat , managing pack lot what made " big " gta games so memorable . but it fell short few key spots , most notably story , characters , series ' biting sense style satire . stuff easy overlook when you could carry liberty city around your back pocket . but ps2 , where you compare it directly three grand theft auto games appeared there , whole package significantly less interesting , even considering ps2 port budget price . not much changed , so if you've already played this psp , there not much reason take ps2 version . game got slightly longer draw distance playstation 2 , streets look like they might few more people them . but neither these things dramatically changes game , they can't save game otherwise murky visuals often poor frame rate . but it also controls little better ; right analog stick back effect , you've got all camera control other buttons you're used hitting ps2 . it neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy , but if you didn't play it psp , liberty city stories ' $20 price tag just right . just don't go expecting anything approaching grandiose nature gtaiii , let alone bigger , crazier vice city or san andreas . if you've already played it psp , well , there little reason play it again , because this same game , multiplayer modes stripped out . return liberty city , new york-themed locale first made famous back grand theft auto iii , liberty city stories all retreading through well-worn territory . if you still remember streets liberty city , you'll see plenty same spots here . but game designed less powerful psp , you'll probably notice liberty city stories much smaller scope than what we've seen series more recently . missions , which grew epic proportions san andreas , much shorter feel pretty meaningless lcs . there plenty moments where you'll complete mission immediately think , " well , least i'll never again . " story , however , biggest casualty . liberty city stories tells tale one toni cipriani , regular-type mob guy who good deed head leone crime family , salvatore leone . toni go away awhile , but heat died down , he back job liberty city , maintaining his loyalty sal while wiping out family enemies droves way . you ascend become salvatore right-hand man , you'll start finish gang wars other mafia types , few triads , yakuza ... pretty much all usual suspects present . if you're familiar various mafia presences over course past three gta games , you'll recognize few names faces here . but story stands alone doesn't require you remember various cast members . that good thing , because mafia characters other gta games largely forgettable . game storyline really isn't up par console installments series , because very little actually happens . even potential plot points squandered , like when toni finally becomes made man but bad cutscene doesn't actually show ceremony . game mission path doesn't deviate into crazy territory , most characters fairly lifeless . there no enigmatic weirdos like truth , crazy hippie san andreas , or steve scott , porno director vice city , break up heavier-handed mafia tasks . this dulls game personality , preventing its characters events becoming memorable we've come expect gta games their excellent storylines .	-1
i enjoying playing this game . once you get used speed brake nos button , your your way mastering this game . this defenitly beats need speed2 : hot persuit . 1 . i think game could better if they us race night through city streets buildings aglow like new york or las vegas , couple races . 2 . i am getting my cars pretty fast i try win game , my last wish this game , bad roads end before you really see how fast your car go , whether your racing or free time . i always seem stop or brake sooner than i'd like road curves race track keeps going . i am fun game anyways . milestones requirements give game nice touch it adds more fun game you try accomplish task avoid getting your car impounded . good game ! - m.o.	-1
this really nice game no matter which system you get it ; especially if you're huge fan show like me . first off , this features impressive gameplay awesome 3-d graphics . heck , they've still got squiggly outlines right ; even 3-d form ! next , there some great special features no needed codes like feature cast members who voices eds plank music video ! you garner these cool extras finding chickens each level . now this game , you play all three eds their neverending hijinks jawbreakers . fact , you find jawbreakers if look real hard each level . there even jawbreaker dispenser somewhere game , but you got certain amount cash hand get them . playing all three ed characters tough , but quite fun way . ed(the one eyebrow ) , you pick up objects throw them using " batter-ed " move smash through walls stuff . edd(the one hat ) , you use his slingshot his distant objects make them fall , use his wit activate machines , use " trampol-edd " move go little higher . eddy(take guess ) , use " el mongo stink bomb " stun your opponents use " tower eddy " move walk across thin walkways , sneak around , grab high items within reach . you even interact other characters show , but watch out those squirrels ! there couple bonus levels seem reminicent eds ' halloween special well those special features i aforementioned . overall , this game , though fairly short full play , very nice one . cartoon network may not much video games ( i.e. dexter : " mandark lab " ps1 , powerpuff girls : " chemical x-traction " n64 ps1 , cartoon network : " speedway " " block party " gba ) , but they seem caught up now this new kids next door game . i hope you enjoy this much i . one more thing : they seem released this game just time new ed-isodes tv ! i'm starting like those , well	1

... not just half-baked product placement tool . bioware decision make game pre-date movies great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom , even within confines star wars brand . biggest reason why kotor won over 40 game-of-the-year awards ( yes , over 40 ) not because you get swing double-bladed lightsaber around use force powers ; it because story ! strong plot crucial every rpg , kotor doesn't disappoint . this plot course includes one biggest twists video game history ( all you fans out there know what i'm talking ! if you don't , then go out buy this game now ) . game principal characters , while somewhat stereotypical ( i.e. bastila condescending socialite snob , carth tough loner troubled past , etc ) , work very well together good chemistry , including you , created character . example , if you play female character , it soon becomes obvious carth develops feelings you , but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago . you'll also find yourself acting mediator when some your allies don't get each other , i.e. canderous carth , because they fought opposite sides mandalorian wars took place five years before . aside character development , game feels very rich its " star wars-ness " -- example , some names bioware came up planets people feel sound like george lucas himself approved them . despite what i said earlier this review , cutting down your enemies lightsaber looking good doing it got one joys kotor . i admit when i first got dantooine verge becoming jedi , i trembling excitement i going build my own lightsaber , i wondered what color i going choose . said all , there some things keep this game getting 5 stars . i felt game bit linear ( able choose your planets any order only gives illusion open-ended gameplay ) . i hoping storyline would different depending whether i decide evil or good , but everything plays same , save few minor events certain conversations . also , there " doorway bug " causes you sometimes get stuck when moving through doorway or narrow corridors . when this happens you wiggle thumbstick free yourself ; i've never any real problems this bug , but it get distracting . also i found moving around menu screens problematic ; you press start go main menu , then you pull trigger buttons move screens , but often i pull trigger multiple times before game responds . also , i'm sure many people would agree game graphics not up xbox standards ; even ps2 capable doing better ! i don't usually gripe graphics , but textures some background buildings taris downright laughable . overall , i give bioware serious kudos taking daunting task like creating new star wars game , i sing their eternal praises actually making it fun . it not stretch say i bought xbox just play kotor ( few other titles , but that story ) , i'm glad i made investment . hey , stop reading this go play	-1
i've seen people love this game hate this game , either there not star wars fan or they hate battle system . i myself love star wars battle sysetm this game . battle system simple yet fun same time . you however many party members you attack then your enemy attacks . first you hate it or think it slow but game progresses you get many mmore attacks defenses get more involved . music star wars . new old music everyone love . story someone said their review worthy script film . story what won this game awards . it also completely changes weather you follow dark or ligh t.t he characters your you come love you talk them whenever they large wealth background info uncover . voice acting also well put together ingages you more down path realism . i would overall rate this game 9.7 out 10when adding flaws good side . this would my top 3 games all time . pros- engaging very great story . - great voice work- splended music- star wars fans fall love- large explorable worlds- great combat , many weapons custamizable weapons . - long story , game ranges 20 - 35 hours long . { it took me 26 my first time my longest 33 - depending all side missions you do}cons- graphics most time fuzzy { unless your playing it 360 } . - very , very , very slow load times- i beat game 12 times , 5 dark , 7 light after you played through story both sides least twice { 4 total } it get old after you know story . - people say it freezes often , mine hasn't ever but framerate slowed down during large battle . overall , i hope my review helpfull i believe game $20 now thats great game this good	1
month ago , i decided purchase my first game system since origional nes . i got ds , i must say i love it . somehow , they found idea seemed only gimmick ( dual screens ) turn it into something new fun . so far , i bought new super mario brothers , mario 64 ds , metroid prime : hunters , mario kart , japan-english dictionary program ( my main justification buying it first place ) . it great way kill 5 min . or kill few hours . once you get used using stylus , it becomes very natural . pros : -fun games all skill levels-nice styling-wireless connectivity-multiple people play same game off one card-bright screen good graphics-nice sound-long battery lifecons : -it fits little awkwardly my hands-you must buy screen protector ( stylus scratch up lower screen pretty badly)-in some games , stylus blocks your view different sections screen-the onyx black looks cool , but it gets extremely smudged up finger printsoverall : cons nothing compared pros . i highly recommend it	1
you might guessed , this cool game i played arcade . it rocks ! time crisis 2 wonderful but this just outstanding . i mean , it cooler graphics , more usable weapons(including grenades ! yowsers ! )better sound effects above all such terrific explosions , shot hits , music gameplay it makes this best time crisis game i've ever played my whole , entire ( beep)ing life ! when i played this arcade , i tons tons fun . why you think i put five stars fun rating ? make this game even more enjoyable , i used fact i am lover animals good people , most especially lions , tigers , jaguars sexy women all sorts . i imagined those kinds innocents mentioned threatened , enemy game poacher slime threatening them(as you know , i not only love big cats , all cool animals decent human beings , i also hate , hate , hate poachers ! )and i hero sidekick who meant save women three large cat races . needless say , every time i killed enemy , bullet or grenade , i let loose words : " go hell , poacher scumbags ! " which course made game all more enjoyable , saving lives which i imagined either big cat species or beautiful woman . anyway whether you imagine this or not , this game best , coolest most fun time crisis ever made if you like shooting games or video games general matter , you must either play this arcade(like me)or if you got ps2 , buy it enjoy ! i'd say it rivals masterpiece silent scope , it so perfect	1
this one best shooter games ever . but $60 it okay maybe worth $40 but still great game overall . it comes free gun which really cool but , really fragile hope this helps	1
i bought this game used wish i could find dozen more like it . i not like video game violence . i don't want kill people . but i love whole exploring world , figuring out puzzles angle . this game perfect . it attractive graphics , interesting premise good challenges . downside , it doesn't really call out replayed once you get through it once . which why it better buy it used ( why i wish they'd make sequel !	1
destroy all humans series brilliant . #2 , you now 1960s , hippies kbg agents all around you . if you didn't play original destroy all humans games , it involved grey , big-eyed aliens coming down earth 1950s . you ran around reading their thoughts , taking over their minds , slaying them . half fun incredibly funny sense humor game you interacted these humans 50s . destroy all humans 2 , we jump forward 1960s . president us ( jfk ) apparently female-loving space alien . kbg realize this try help out . next thing you know , aliens attack again - you're charge . you run around city maps , watching hippy chicks shout out " back off , pig ! " reading their minds . you mentally throw objects , take over bodies , much more . this game much more " active " than other adventure games - you hammer buttons get actions occur . you can't just passively press one button all set . graphics great . you really get immersed into world 60s , appropriate cars , hippy vans , murals painted walls . outfits people wear super . there traditional items collect , objectives achieve people slay . but again , most fun what you hear way . commentary hilarious . thoughts you overhear get you laughing out loud . if humans happy see you doing something " alieny " , you zap them free love - daisies dancing their brain , hippy music , soon distract them any troublesome thoughts grey aliens . even better , if you friend come visit , you o-o play ! now , there few anachronisms - didn't " love one you're " come out 1970 ? or maybe they're saying stephen stills got his inspiration hippy dude named freak . any case , i'm sure destroy all humans 3 set 70s , so we'll get enough soon enough . meantime , sure get your hands this version , help bring peace world	1
hello my name zachary . i am really enjoying series unfortunate events video game it very fun . it mini-games within game itself . you invent things pieces parts you find game . sometimes you deafeat count olaf henchmen either klaus or violet . also , if there small holes sunny crawl through them . only flaw i found game overall game too short .	1
so after finishing cod2 went out get cod3 . general game fairly similar its predecessor . graphics general taken nice step up , sound . explosions more realistic , there more caustics , specular highlighting environment mapping scenes . rain more rain-like ( apparently it really rains france ! ) . reloading slightly slower process ( it some these weapons , so more realistic ) . grenades seem much less devastating versus cod2 ( toss one into contained room/bunker most germans survive blast ?? )however , some things really annoy me : biggest cut scenes ... let me skip them , especially when returning one i saved ! if i've already seen movie why we're attacking st. lo , then seeing nazi march under arc de triomphe boring annoying after 1 take ... even worse , you get farther , it still loads old cut scene despite gotten much further . slow game mission briefing sarge equally annoying it runs slowly . if i want skip , please let me ... there more little bumps you can't climb over ( little gullies hedges it not let you walk up , but space next it which appears identical ) . this makes game feel more linear . game feels very linear ( if it presents you 3 buildings you take , it pretty obvious which one game wants you take first , all other teammates run one building only)i found myself " stuck " member my team . we both went climb stairwell got caught each other ( stooge style ) can't free up move . eventually something happens he starts moving i move again . very annoyin	-1
shouldn't you people know now ? say it me : never buy movie games . friend mine bought it it horrible . it way too easy die , etc , etc , etc . hey listen . keep you money . your investment isn't here	-1
you played any games doom series ? how metroid prime ? medal honor ? golden eye ? well , then you've played halo 2 , also , because all first person shooter games exactly same . i don't care how many times x-box magazine ( odd how magazine drools most over x-box game system magazine . ) calls it greatest game all time , i'd rather play mario power tennis which atrocious . story absolutely appauling terms science fiction orientated theme , utterly mundane , unoriginal , boring just all around unentertaining . gameplay so generic it if this first creation some fresh out college video game designer , music cliche , voice acting flat , master chief just all around retard . weapons , oh boy , weapons , again lame aspect game . alien weapons like something kid " toy gun " section toys us , human guns nothing i haven't used resident evil game . when first halo came out i didn't get big deal , i didn't even play it , then eventually i got myself x-box , decided give this installment shot - huge mistake . come think it none games x-box even worth owning system : fable decent , but got old after beating it few times , knights old republic series boring , everything else x-box i could play ps2 or gamecube	-1
beautiful graphics nice storyline , but amount times game freezes or you receive error just awful ! not mention , monsters level up you so you'll never advantage . you could pretty much beat game level 5	-1

it pretty much all said , let just say it again ' cause i'm sure firaxis/firefly plant positive reviews here . game takes ages load , voice acting silly ( british ? australian ? herman hermits ? ) , progression totally linear ( ie game fails become more complicated higher levels ) , graphics date 2002 , citizen ' fetching ' system completely random opaque . sit watch awhile : your huts change size every thirty seconds . most importantly , boo sid , boo . you could've produced this bad caesar3 ripoff called it anything , but you called it " civcity " , even put tiny civilopedia it . haven't you got enough money ? civ series brilliant . don't cash it	-1
concept this game strong , it got some cute ideas , but voice recognition - especially word " blue " - character recognition abysmal . it makes " game " exercise frustration , more than anything else . character recognition ... unless you write whatever font game programmed recognize , it going record your answers something different than what you wrote . you penalized when system doesn't recognize " blue " or correct number . if system so rigid it only accepts one way saying " blue " , then system should sound file tells you what it wants hear . number recognition , it should screen shows you how system wants numbers written , or it should able allow you enter your numbers correlate them numbers within system . ( when i make this mark , it = 4)also , " intro " content absurdly long , no way skip over it . huge waste time after first 10x you've seen it . i just got game today , i've spent hours trying figure out way say blue such game recognize it ... now , i just wish i could return opened software . i'm very frustrated entire experience	-1
i started caesar2 back when it came out . i played it hours hours loved it . when caesar3 came out i bought too loved it even more spent even more time playing . both caesar2 3 rarely crashed . things changed!i'm spending more more my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it . 8 out 10 times i access area where you trade other cities it crashes . without trading , you make little money game essentially over . other problems i'm seeing overall performance . i don't fastest machine ( amd 2.1 ghz , 512ram , rockin ' video card 256meg mem ) but there irritating 1 second delays addition crashes . i find whole game difficult use . this not case caesar3 . unless they issue patch , i'm feel frustrated crashes . maybe i dumb down graphic setting get rid delays . my suggestion ? wait patch before buying --- or move . - jason	-1
opening cutscene introduces you blinx cat , supporting cast particulars his upcoming adventures , i found myself trying wrap my brain around basic premise story . idea secret , off-world clan humanoid cat creatures , armed souped up vacuum cleaners , responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map . it seems time , when compressed tightly enough transported said cats , takes form one five different brightly-colored shapes . if these crystals left out open too long without properly introduced flow things , they turn into monsters . i could go , because game certainly doesn't stop there , but i think you get point . i like think there fairly thick line drawn cartoony fantasy super-detailed realism . generally , lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game , because they're almost exclusively set photorealistic , lifelike location . cartoons , other hand , generally don't worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time . how much fun would wile . coyote cartoons if every time lead character suffered grisly fate , it strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics ? blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story that overly detail-centric environment that right out kid show . result tale comes off way , way out left field almost completely abstract . it focuses things would better left viewer imagination ignores importance good underlying story way . beneath needless discussions why there monsters world , how time compression works how cats actually responsible all we hold dear , actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic . there princess , evil pigs kidnapped her , it up you you only rescue her save her world . that it , no side-stories , no reasoning , no subplots - just straightforward rush point point . here i thought phrase " save princess " universally recognized ages-old cliche . now , i don't want it sound like i'm railing this game just because it got few more nitpicky details than its peers it reuses old phrase way back platformer handbook its sole driving factor . it also completely lacking character development , general storytelling ongoing inspiration . none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals , including lead character himself . you don't hate pig spaceship because he trying destroy world , you hate him because every time he shows up he tries steal your money . i honestly forgot there princess end game after level three , because she never mentioned game start its finish . i mean , very first super mario brothers least reminded you princess castle end every boss fight . i don't honestly think game really designed enjoyable so much it geared overly challenging . first level half set up standard " get know you " format , simplest enemies , most routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around your tools . shortly thereafter , you're thrown wolves . most part , level designs very short , more emphasis cheap hits than complexity true challenge . i noticed lot overlap stage layouts , whether it retracing your steps time time again or walking catwalk ( har har ) above beginning stage invariably plummeting back start point . you'll almost always know what needs , but actually accomplishing act real trick . i just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most this game really . if there bottomless pit nearby , ( chances very good there ) blinx find way force himself into it , regardless what you're hitting control pad . if there enemy two feet front you you hit attack button , he'll aim random switch other side room , rather than imminent threat . that not say entirety time sweeper totally without merit , because it bring few fresh ideas table , but most part those insights hampered their surroundings . ability control time , instance , time really fresh , interesting new play mechanic still stands out today , despite limited field imitators since emerged . you rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware or rebuild crumbling bridge , pause action take advantage frozen time , knock level into slow motion , etc . all while , blinx moving around real time . it great idea , but implementation painfully short underutilized . why can't i use two controls same time ? why don't more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems these powers ? why doesn't ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause , speed up or rewind when i use my time powers ? why their duration so brief , why can't i hold more than dozen uses time ? i mean , this could've really fantastic experience if time control aspect beefed up little further treated more than just auxiliary function otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer . controls , too , undeveloped , undertested nightmare . blinx himself often sluggish respond , especially when implementing his time controls . he difficulty making precise turn , whether midair or solid ground . he stops briefly celebrate when gaining item , which leaves him open constant enemy attacks . he routinely moves direction certain death , though pulled magnetic field , whether you've instructed him so or not . he'll occasionally refuse perform double jump , particularly when attempting difficult , precise leap across gaping chasm . i think it these controls most make blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating . glance , you'd imagine they'd fairly difficult screw up . you've got jump button , suction / fire button , time control button analog stick control movement . plus , there already long , established line three-dimensional platformers market years before title release , paving way ideal control experience . super mario 64 its issues , sure , but nothing like this , it trailblazer entire genre jump world 3d . it like they map leading them right treasure decided forge their own path anyway . i can't even say i'm impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper , either . exception lead character himsef , these some incredibly cheesy , preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished hurried , less purposeful than you'd imagine ( especially contrast blinx himself ) . particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels , trying vain bump into you cause fatal injury . here finely detailed main character , such close attention paid his wardrobe even gloss his shoes obviously debated time time again , he pitted against set monsters could've sprung life directly out pages four-year-old sketchbook . despite featuring spoken dialog track , there no english voice acting . i couldn't pinpoint language , but my wife seems think it either french or some close variation it . it certainly didn't sound japanese . while this add touch personality title , it not every day you get chance hear cat shouting something language love , it all seemed really odd out place coming out my television . everyone vocal personalities so black-and-white , too , i feel like great chance establish some much-needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here . bad guys all same deep , gravelly , transparently evil tone , while good guys all bright , cheery , squeaky high-pitched like monkeys super monkey ball . it like parody games come before , but i won't give developers enough credit assume they doing it purpose . overall , blinx really just few promising concepts thrown together one package , strapped shell far-below-average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public . time its release , it still need lot polishing , some serious scrutiny behind closed doors re-evaluation just how far some these concepts half-hearted character designs could conceivably stretched without losing any quality . top , i really don't know which audience they targeting it . game ridiculously difficult , which betrays childlike demeanor surrounds it leads me believe it meant serious gamers out there , but so bright , kid-friendly annoyingly cutesy i can't imagine anyone demographic rushing out stores release day . number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during my time blinx , reaching near-marvel vs . capcom 2 levels its unashamed , excruciatingly cheap hits , especially later levels . i no idea how i acquired willpower finish level eigh t.t he game adequately lengthy , offers some replay value , hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches , promotional materials like . once you start hunting floating cat heads those super-tough later levels , though , you'll remember why you so happy finished them first place . unless you feel like pulling your hair out clumps ( i shaved my head after experience part cleansing process ) enjoy self-mutilation , i'd recommend you stay far away	-1

first off , i cannot believe how mad this game made me . i like all kinds games , but honestly trying figure out some levels this game left me stumped . it one thing stuck somewhere retry lot , but several times during this game i stuck area no idea where do/what , etc ... even after i killed all bad guys i didn't know how get out room . this game not intuitive ( sp ? ) all ! secondly , this game should not called incredibles , it should called mr. incredible , because you play him almost all time . playing elasta-girl great , i really enjoyed part , but when there lot baddies guns , mr. incredible pain since he no way block anything , so you spend lot time getting pushed back until bad guys reload . i liked first mission dash ( when you play dash , which only twice ) you run fast ; however second mission i just lost my patience because i restart million times because i couldn't see what ahead me . playing violet bad , they should lot more her instead boring stealth mission . incredi-ball mission incredibi-sucked , it took me like hour hit something because it difficult place . i'm just finishing up game now quite frankly i haven;' enjoyed lot it , which shame because i really loved movie . some levels too hard because you barely find way something mr. incredible needs more than punch people . currently i'm rocket silo level i keep falling down trying get onto platform . what load fun 100 times or more . bottom line : playing elasta-girl fun , everything else either blah , or made me want swear lot . hopefully second game better . i'll renting instead buying , this game left me disappointed overall	-1

i've this game since it first came out i am still not sick it . i think anyone enjoys halo multiplayer would enjoy this game . lucasarts improved just everything you think first battlefront . story mode galactic conquest ( strategy mode ) excellent additions basic battlefront where you simply take over bases kill enemy ( but thank goodness they still kept this game ) . i miss some old scenarios , but lot new scenarios really good new controls make battlefront ii totally worth playing . i love improved controls , new characters , new space battles . ability sprint ingenious addition . most games you walk , or run . this game characters ability run very fast sprinting . they also kneel , lay , dive , roll . i hope all future action games adopt this . i wish characters ability punch someone , after all they just everything else . ability change your character bases you control nice addition . engineers ability repair things or take over occupied enemy vehicles great . there nice array weapons ability play specialized characters such darth vader or boba fett awesome . space battles really fun , except when you board enemy ship there only limited areas you access . graphics great hd . pros : controlsability sprintchange characters basesengineers repair things steal enemy vehiclesgraphicsmultiple scenariosa lot charactersplay specialty characters ( jedi)space battlesmultiple playing options ( strategy mode , story mode , basic battlefront mode)cons : characters don't ability punch someoneboarding enemy ship space battle very limited access enemy shipsome fun scenarios first battlefront not this onethe option flying multiple ships , playing multiple characters , using turrets both space battles regular battles , all multiple things your characters make this game worth playing	1

i've through doom3 now three times . first time i didn't even cheat . i won't go into how great game it but stick few short comings . one , game started off perfect . little bit realism goes long way but later degraded into world comic bookish nightmareism ... skeletons missile launchers their shoulders come ! bugger man rocket launcher pace right hand .. aaah ! it isn't hard figure out why id it , they trying spice it up bit keep it interesting ... i understand , i just don't agree . two , no mass attacks monsters use up all your hard won ammunition . instead you transport our marine h-ll once more search find same things all over again -- all these games ! monster nazi helmet whip -- more comic book filler . three , game cheat every other room searched gets little irritating . you know monster other side darkened doorway . you throw dozen gernades there , monster isn't hurt . you take step forward , monster jumps out you blast it . then -- course -- monster which appeared out nowhere behind you , attacks . answer course walk backward , trip ' if then ' statment program , shoot monster behind turn around shoot one front -- your second attempt get through door . i get tired computer gamecheating because i makes me cheat beat game . i don't mind dark areas , whole base just went h-ll , i would expect lights not always work . four , i've heard those h-ll knights destroyed big green glowing plasma gun/cannon . well , i it thirty eight hand grenades ! game would -- i think -- better if two or three turn loose roam hallways looking humans munch randomly . five , basically , never enough fighting room . understandable station world pressurized atmosphere . rooms would all small . exploding barrels pressurized enviroment , what hoot ! yuck , yes i said yuck instead number , belted ammunition machineguns usually came 100 round belts -- not sixty . mini guns used chained belts -- i know , i use repair them . plasma gun munitions travel far too slow . shotgun needs longer barrel so it still choke keep pellets spread out too wide becoming useless after ten feet . handgrenades can't thrown properly . light machinegun firing rate half what it should ... goodiness sake , get some duck tape flashlight tape you weapon . list could go these ' little ' things ... but game easily worth money . remember , these mostly suggestions id future program	-1
i decided buy star wars republic commando xbox my son , because he won't let me play my pc version . come find out it seems like it plays easier xbox . this game far one best i've ever played . it awesome . i find it very exiting actually feels like part combat squad . everyone team knows pro-active , rather than reactive . i haven't seen game yet , where squad members react direct or indirect fire these commandos it . you don't move your team , they'll their job . you also redirect their orders they follow orders letter . able " inject " them bacta , makes game whole lot better just " finding med kit " , other hand , while you're injured , rescued your crew definitely gives you feeling you team !!! only regret ( just small one ) game so short ( or least it felt like it ) . it only three major campains , game so much fun , it seemed like time flew . i only hope lucasarts decides make republic commando ii ( maybe , based missions omega squad ) ... here hoping . i definintely recommend this game , squad-based combat or star wars fans alike , you'll get kick out it . i'm definintely fan " delta squad , republic commandos	1
after playing grand theft auto iii , i thought there no way rockstar could top themselves . fact , when advance word this game got out , i actually thought this nothing more than add-on gta3 . stupid thought , i know ; whole , gta : vc bigger , badder , more audacious than gta3 ever . so , here story : 1986 , tommy vercetti -- hitter forelli crime family liberty city -- finally released prison . sonny forelli , his boss , immediately sends him down vice city close major drug deal handled ken rosenberg , shyster lawyer forellis ' contact . no sooner deal closed than gunmen break it all up , kill everyone but tommy ken , take both drugs cash . now , tommy recover money sonny ... but before long , he decides make name himself this town . setting pure ' 80s excess , through through . if you take bottomless amoral corruption scarface , day-glo polyester fashion miami vice , innate cheesy greed ronald reagan 1980s american culture , you'll vice city . you'll see it fashion sense citizens , local architecture , cars tooling around road . you'll even hear it radio stations , which boast array heavy metal , dance , latino , bubblegum pop music like which you haven't even thought since ' 80s . i swear ; try listening one radio stations see if memories don't come flooding back . voice acting , usual , superb . ray liotta outstanding job bringing tommy vercetti life , making otherwise loathsome sociopath into strangely likable character . there others well ; burt reynolds , dennis hopper , gary busey , lee majors , fairuza balk , robert davi all turn great performances . but philip michael thomas , who played don johnson partner tubbs miami vice , gets special mention ; more ways than one , his character -- lance vance -- one keep eye . while main story missions only take up third game itself , it addition new feature not only rounds things out , it also adds length game , really makes you feel like you're establishing criminal empire . they're called asset properties . certain point game , you option buying certain businesses . once you buy one these asset properties , you complete its mission strand , business start generating daily amount money you pick up . some them perfectly legitimate , such taxi company or nightclub . others little sketchy , like boatyard or strip club , but others absolutely illegal , like protection rackets , " ice cream " company , or car showroom . they add great amount depth , they let you establish contacts across town . needless say , once sonny forelli comes town " check up " you , make no mistake ... he now your town . so , if you feel need get away it all indulge your inner tony montana , book trip vice city . like san andreas , it great place visit unwind ... also like san andreas , you'll glad you don't live there	1

nintendo dominated handheld industry since gameboy came out . now sony stepped , some predicted their hold might finally breaking . not so , there no better proof than ds lite . lite evolutionary step over original ds , similar gameboy advance sp . it more compact form factor , brighter screens , side-mounted power button , weighs less , longer battery life , simply looks more fashionable . basic functionality ds still here- same buttons general button layout , wi-fi , gba compatibility , etc . this worth buying if you already ds ? maybe , if you've got some spare cash . this worth buying if you don't own ds ? definitely . design far superior old ds . no ds review would complete without further mention psp . while psp undoubtedly more capable device , it significant weaknesses compared ds . particularly , psp games tend far longer load times , it much shorter battery life , hardware itself more fragile . oh , course , there cost . most critical factor , however , library games available . now , ds games more better , there simply no contest when it comes which more offer this department . games what really make or break console , wide variety excellent casual immersive ds titles make it clearcut winner .	1
mario luigi partners time me takes me back snes , first mario rpg " super mario rpg : legend seven stars " game i absolutely love ( would also recommend anyone snes or emulator ) . reason general gameplay this rpg hasn't changed . you move around different screens , attack enemies , fight bosses , etc . there definately unique ( i suppose you might consider it simplistic ) ideology this game follows . it easier version action/rpgs , you level up , battles aren't random ( you see enemies you engage screen ) though it turn-based . this game plays feels much like original legend seven stars , but added its own twists funny little story line make it , it own game . i highly recommend this game anyone who doesn't mind lot chatting , but even more action puzzles ! homerun mario rpgs	1

note : this review spoiler free regards game storyall good things must eventually come end , such star wars series , lord rings trilogy , jak daxter trilogy ( not including racing game daxter own psp game ) . after two excellent games , our favorite elfin friend his furry sidekick come last entry jak trilogy . big question : it good ending ? i'm pleased say overall , yes . jak 3 takes place undetermined time after conclusion jak 2 . haven city become divided after relentless attacks robots , metal heads other nasties . population blames jak these problems he finds himself flown out wasteland , harsh unforgiving desert where nobody survive without help . abandoned those he saved , jak his buddy daxter set out thier final adventure . like it two predecessors , jak 3 platforming game combined gun shooter . you get various jumps , kicks , punches leaps , you also get wide array firearms take out your foes when your fancy kung-fu karate aren't enough . jak moves remain largely unchanged jak 2 ( which now called j2 ) . he still punch like man , jump like kangaroo , leap like bullfrog . gunplay remains pretty much same well . you get four guns ( blaster , rifle , machine gun peacemaker ) , but nice twist , each weapon gets various upgrades game goes . rifle example , starts out it default setting . hower , next upgrade allows it shoot richochet bullets while third upgrade gives it flying platform shoots bullets all directions . each gun three upgrades playing them blast . peace maker example , fire shot paralyzes all enemies makes them float around ( whee ! ) while it final upgrade ... well , let just say you'll shooting mini-nukes lo t.t he biggest change jak game play comes form vehicles . while j2 flying vehicles zoomers , jak 3 cars ( not nice , talking pixar kind ) . because half game set desert , jak daxter get around dune buggies . there eight them each various unique traits . some really , really fast , one jump riddiculously high ( wheee ! ) some them spin out control slightest twitch control stick ( boo ! ) . you'll spending lot time driving buggies most part , it enjoyable fun , though some them ( such sand shark ) bit difficult handle . new feature jak 3 sheer size it . j1 j2 two enormous areas run around . here , you not one , not two , but three , yes , three ! gigantic areas run around . like previous games , there no loading times , astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds ( spargus city , wasteland haven city ) . you'll definatly see lot amazing sights during your trips throughout jak 3 world ( such how haven city ... ahem ... changed since last game ) . dark jak powers return well , but now balanced new side our hero ... light jak . if dark jak attacking force , light jak defensive force . dark allows you kill things really quickly , while light allows you heal , fly ( this so awesome ! ) , surround yourself inpenetrable shield , even slow down time crawl . both powers activated any time long you light dark eco your meters . very nice touch , you stop light or dark touch button save your energy when you really need it . while both light dark come into play vital moments during gameplay , both really just little added bonus spice up gameplay when you want , you play throughout game without needing use either force ( except scripted moments where you need ) . but then again , able heal yourself whenever you want very handy thing ! * smile*like j2 , jak 3 you going place place , talking people doing what they tell you . when you finish , you head over next person what they want , etc . it linear system makes it easy tell where go what next it sounds fairly restrictive , but it one big strength : you don't start next mission until you want . if you want , you wander around wasteland blowing up wanderers twenty hours , go hunt down twelve precurser orbs watch sun go up down three times , then tackle mission . this free roaming system allows you what you'd like if you don't feel like doing missions while . one thing i'd like address before we go any further difficulty level . if one takes look my review j2 , one find lot anger hatred directed towards naughty dog making j2 most unnecessarily hardest game i've ever played ( it still way , tied only spider man ps2 ) . i am very pleased naughty dog towned down difficulty lot jak 3 . no longer each every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it , no longer you throwing controller into tv while screaming obscenities becuase a**hole errol won fricken race again . here , difficulty seems just right . not too hard , not too easy . most missions require few attempts before they completed , few finished one try . there still few quite difficult , one or two grit-your-teeth inducing , but overall , nothing infuriating many moments previous entry series . oh , there only few " go through ring " missions this time around . thank goodness . addition free-roaming gameplay , there also plenty secrets unlock this quest . there over 600 precurser orbs find collect jak 3 , doing so you get unlock various features such unlimited dark light jak power , invincibility , extra vehicles , various weapon upgrades , etc . while some hidden behind corners , many these orbs collected doing various challenges people throw your way , such searching around paticular area , going through rings ( grumbles ) , following little blue light even stopping time . there plenty things get those little shiny orbs , but results well worth it . addition , jak 3 arguably best moments series terms " wow " factor . fighting gigantic sixty story tall monster only dune buggy moment sends shivers down your spine . even all these fine points , jak 3 stutter little bit what arguably most important part game ... story . j2 most memorable me it story . it many twists turns you never really knew what expect next . story jak 3 good one it keep your interest what going happen next ... but ultimitly , it left me unsatisfied . how so ? three biggest ones charachters , precursers ending . those you worrying i'm going tell you who precursers ( which i won't ) i'm going keep this spoiler free i . first off , charachters . we jak daxter course , those two always fun watch care . we many returning charachters such torn , sig , samos , we some new residents spargus city . problem ? almost all returning charachters zilch charachter development . it assumed you know them last game because , jak 3 takes no time explain who they or what they . may okay , but pretty much none charachters expanded all . torn still gruff tough ( but not much last time ) , ashelin firm leader , samos gives warnings what may happen planet if things go badly . keira , who such vital charachter j1 j2 , absoloutly nothing story aside look pretty important . sig ... well , he just there because he cool . only returning charachter who kept me interested tess , who fufills " dumb blonde " role . her relationship daxter sweet lighthearted kept my interest easily . errol returns well ( though i won't say how ) , but he gone " insanely irritating " " average irritating " , sad departure his compellingly egotistic nature j2 . new charachters , only one , damos , kept my interest due his charachter . tough , yet gentle caring same time , he easily most compelling jak new companions . new villian , count veger , isn't compelling , though he some very powerful scenes ( especially one near ending ) . one claims back game box we'll discover shocking secret who precursers really . i said earlier , i won't reveal who precursers ( someone ruined suprise me ) , except my personal opinion , we should never find out who precursers leave them mystery . i personally felt seeing who they really sucked out all suspense mystery , esepcially since they talked length two games now . it like revealing face doctor claw . when you go back experience your old memories , there no more mystery or wonder anymore . my personal opinion , these beings should remained hidden forever . however , saddest part game me ending . again , i won't ruin it you , but it always sad when game developers wrap entire trilogy up three minutes . some people criticise ending film , return king , saying it goes too long . however , ending lord rings film trilogy took it time wrapping up threads three movies bringing closure story leaving one satisfied . however , jak 3 doesn't . game goes gets closer end , feeling dread idea everything destroyed just vanishes pretty much gone time final boss battle comes ( sadly , battle itself isn't exciting or memorable ) . ending end trilogy , but leaves door wide open more games ( which two already happened ) . i've invested lot time these three games , i've grown attatched it charachters i would like closure all thier stories . saldy , doesn't happen . everything left wide open when , my opinion , it should closed . there no real ending here , least , one ties everything up nicely . but despite my points story , i want stress jak 3 very good game . it satisfying blend storytelling , platforming , shooting , driving , action . it one those games where you keep saying " just five more minutes , just five more minutes " , only discover time flown it two morning . it addictive , fun , , me , blast play . i definitly recommend it , especially if you find it under twenty dollars	-1

i know i'm little late , but what heck ? i felt like writing review this game . final fantasy just fantastic game . simple . its extremely deep , fantastic story , great characters , great battle system , it perfect length rpg ( 45-55 hours ) . not everyone likes tidus , he honestly doesn't bother me , i think he interesting character . rest cast well developed , they all interesting personalities distinct this universe . cast very memorable , you'll remember them years come , i think speaks volumes how good this game . its enhanced usual good voice acting square known , so doesn't disapoin t.t he gameplay extremely fun , its actually one my favorite battle systems . battle system make or break rpg , this one doesn't disappoint . its fast paced , so it doesn't get bogged down long battles . you also swap characters mid battle , thats awesome feature . gameplay also incredibly deep , i've heard people literally pouring hundreds hours into this game . so if thats your thing , i'm sure you've probably already played this game . if some reason you not played this game your into rpg , don't hesitate pick this game up , its cheap now , its one best most balanced rpg i've ever played	1
if you want star movie stopping your own death , play this game . it if you star film . but also means there many cut-scenes . these cut-scenes very well great graphics , excellent music , very dramtic . but there those you out there don't liek cut-scenes all . if this case you reader , don't buy this game . if you love movies , enjoy watching cut-scenes , you can't go wrong this game . i played entire game let me tell you , it steal any price . it good ... if you like cut-scenes	1
i am huge fan world war 2 first person shooters . i've genre since begining medal honor . since then , not too much more impresive me than call duty . it wonderfual game still . call duty 2 even better . this new game maintain stellar streak series ? word , yes . although , it alot more same . but then again , why mess great formula ? call duty 3 works because it exactly what original game built around , sheer intensity .... also alot fun . but then you might say , well i've played cod2 , you saying its same ? yes no . basic mechanics same few newly added gameplay elements little nothing overall game so escense . yea , its same game . but this time around levels bigger look o so much prettier . honestly , these some most amazing visuals xbox 360 . i dare say it puts my beloved cod2 near shame . lighting texturing beautiful explosions heart stopping behold . life like graphics complimented brilliant musical score . oh , if anyone should wonder ingame soundeffects , just pop previous call duty game imagine it amped up even more . seriously , battlechatter never so nicely integrated . cod3 yet amazing world war 2 game certainly keep veterans genre happy content , meaning edge your seat . newly implimented rag doll physics destructable enviroments make sure you stay there too . i reccomend this game anyone everyone who played world war two first person shooter enjoyed it because what we here ladies gentelmen latest greatest , best money buy	1
i just got this game thursday i'm already disc 2 . this my first time ever playing final fantasy game i'm glad i picked number 9 . i won't spoil anything telling any story , but i tell you game amazing . graphics great there best i've ever seen ps1 game . i love characters , i'd say vivi my favorite then next would zidane , but really i love them all . playing final fantasy 9 made me wanna buy other games play them too . buy this game , you won't regret it .	1
i've dvd players come go , so its kinda cool gaming console plays dvd too . yeah , i know ps2 capability without remote , i one those too . but one cool things i noticed box playback kit remote looks just like ones made rca . i tried few controls dvd funtion my rca universal remote , low behold it worked . kinda hand thing , i've got many remotes floting around it , so part nice . mine works great , i use it instead re-arrange my already overpacked entertainment center put my other dvd player .	1
several years , several sequels , passed now , so gta iii really worth time ? i'd definitely say so . this game continues incredibly fun years later . you pick it up just play or you advance through stories . each engaging creative , just like sequels . when it comes down it , this great game it still holds its weight against sequels knock off games . it definite buy	1
i liked ssx series , sequel 3 best , but i didn't play racers . i bought first nfsu disliked choppy animation . i got part two just out curiosity i liked it so much i beat game . basically , you newbie bayview city you race different type races build rep your car . you must tune your car each type race you must check shops frequently . there various shops , visual effect paint shops ones which improve your car speed , handling etc . races also different : you races isolated tracks , races live trafic , street races confined cramped space without nitro option , lot dirty driving hitting ; short tracks which you win if you shift gear time , my favorites , drift races , which you win if you get most points , not if you pass line first . drift races won breaking steering order make long trail . i used automatic shifting i set game difficulty easy since i don't play racers . i 93 percent i got into race which unmarked map . it 6 circuit race against boss final one . some advice beginngers : if you can't find races map , go garage check out world map option you'll get list all races per level . if you beat them can't find any more races , upgrade your car or get some stars visual rating getting ' cosmetics ' ( new parts like spoilers , lights , new paint ) you'll get offer magazine cover or dvd . if you still stuck , cruise town find unmarked races	-1
this fun game , only thig i say i wish ps2 or sony could web site where you download current rosters , next seasons games . it kinda sucks , if i want play next season i guess i go out buy madden 2007 updated rosters	1
i enjoyed this game quite bit -- i ended up putting all other games i playing aside just finish this one . you play three baudelaire kids . story follows 2004 lemony snicket film fairly closely , you must first escape count olaf decrepit mansion , then avoid killed train before you head off uncle monty herpetology paradise , aunt josephine seaside town , finally save violet baudelaire fate worse than death . environments attractive fun explore , game play puzzles neither too easy nor too challenging frustrating . most game -- you explore environments , solve puzzles , search secret rooms such , you switch violet klaus baudelaire you please . many " important " events , such boss fights , you must play one or other , they each different skills weapons . some sequences -- those basically 2d platformer sections ( entire game some platformer aspects , but it usually loosely employed 3d ) , you must play sunny , baby baudelaire ( this only time you play her ) . various puzzles challenges -- they almost amount series " mini-games " , varied mostly non-repetitive , helping retain your interest . some fairly easy figure out perform , but some appropriately more challenging , both mentally terms manipulating controller , take many tries complete . couple first-person shooter sequences ( game mostly third person mode ) , especially challenging , particularly end , but that final boss fight , so that expected . like most games , winning boss fights requires discerning patterns bosses adapting strategy appropriate pattern , which takes both brains manual dexterity . there couple negatives game , but they minor . games like this , released response success film , often rushed through production . becomes evident here cut scenes , which not very exciting -- they feature 2d black white sketches more like slide show major portions story read us . but i'd rather skimping cut scenes than game play , that just what here . also , although graphics wonderful most part , visuals bit dark overall -- i found it best play lights off . bright overhead light , glare too much see important information game . finally , i would preferred different save game scheme , you only save when game asks if you want , save points seem almost random . sometimes you save after accomplishing only one more minor task . sometimes you long sequences ( sometimes number challenging ones ) before you save again . game isn't quite funny film doesn't exactly same " magical " atmosphere , but it engaging fun journey world . soundtrack , jeremy julian soule , inspired thomas newman great soundtrack film , also major asset -- i found myself wanting explore levels again later much hear music again anything else	1

this game great . can't wait god war 2	1
movie tie-ins usually rather tiresome affair . they sell bundles units more often than not large pile mediocrity . godfather game different . obviously it made back unparalleled success francis ford coppolla gangster masterpiece . it sell this reason well . however , godfather game it own place epic narrative . it would easy ea put player shoes michael corleone - main protagonist movies . indeed , it may due failure securing license use al pacino voice likeness forced ea hand creating fresh perspective famous storyline . what we're left new take featuring your good self ; narrative sees you seamlessly weave out events loyal film . example , when luca brasi stabbed through hand garrotted - start first movie - you look event through window , you're spotted scene turns into revenge mission . it expertly executed you feel part story genuine loyal film . violence superbly recreated also . realistic nature firearms godfather makes interesting gameplay . you might used rather `cartoonish ' gunplay saint row gta , godfather might first seem unforgiving . it . but it realistic - take one bullet close range you're sleeping fishes ... it simple . conversely your own guns carry same clout , so shootouts often become intense challenging affairs , if little frustrating . where gta gun fighting success dependent how quickly you change targets get your shots off , godfather sees you picking your shots timing runs cover . it obvious ea development focussed heavily walking shooting parts game , this where most appeal lies . driving however different affair altogether . given nature godfather ea limited what isn't possible driving sections . physics cars mean they frustrating play . most vehicles slow faster cars seem unnaturally quick . handbrake turns work so well gta irritatingly difficult pull off , especially when chased coppers . cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected . other vehicles , however , seemingly made concrete . also , getting one way point times tedious - gta gets round this superbly scripted radio stations , but godfather doesn't such ingenuity - you're instead treated violin-based soundtrack depressing once novelty runner . valid excuse most this isn't ea fault - this more or less what it like drive car ' them days ' . there no radio ; cars lame , classic , but moved like pair concrete boots . where violence so real , so must rest game if only consistency . you would expect much what you directed storyline . however there provisions those who more impulsive . outside missions there businesses extort rackets take over . doing such build your weekly wage , which you then turn spend clobber sorting your hair out . you respect bar increases each completed mission , but coolly this isn't only way gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters . buying nice wise guy suit brings plaudits boosts respect meter much whacking guy . each time your character levels up you get point allocate his attributes . it bit weak rpg element , but worth thinking when acquiring garments . extorting businesses tricky , but worth effort . you'll usually take out two or three ' bad guys ' before able get owner . when you situation requires thought . essentially you need scare businessman into paying , you so finding his or her ' limit ' . so while some owners agree ' protection ' soon you ask , others battered brink death . pretty sick , but then life gangster isn't fairies . warned though , going over top or killing proprietor render business inactive while you'll get nothing but bruised set knuckles . it fantastic sidetrack main game taken seriously if you want hire muscle buy more powerful weapons later missions . so you've got two sections same game sit paradoxically each other . superbly well balanced combat game play forces you thoughtful timely . very dodgy vehicle part frustrates bores more than anything else . it difficult review sandbox game without making comparison gta , although it slightly unfair so godfather given rules imposed subject matter . it very best it delivers gritty realism , but same realistic token , it times terribly dull . it difficult dislike godfather ea so faithful everything we loved films - but this undoing game also . it would forgivable exaggerate gameplay places order make it more entertaining . but godfather game purists order please it feel genuine , godfather certainly .	-1
chrono cross , which semi sequel 1995 chrono trigger , cant even come close its former games plateua . chrono trigger arguably greatest rpg ever created . so while chrono cross ' not good ' it still whole heck lot things righ t.t he gameplay , story , battles this game all top notch . its fun get handle over numerous tough boss battles this game because elemental magics strategic system . black beats white red beats blue , etc . its always fun interesting see what next dungeon or boss offer . gameplay never sluggish always keep you your toes . also , when you beat game you option replay entire game again all your beefed up characters before . if things going slow you speed them up fast forward button your second play through game . truly brilliant ! so why this game get 4 out 5 if it so darn good ? because its confusing/tedious magic system over abundance characters . most magics summons this game joy watch behold their might . but this game there no magic points you must ' equip ' every single magic spell you . could mean 50+ spells equip per character ! setting up each character late game take upwards 5-10 minutes easily . each spell only cast once per battle unless you buy multiples spell . probably games worst point its ridiculous amount characters . chrono trigger something like 7 recruitable characters you play , each their own terrific unforgettable personalities . chrono cross 44 recruitable characters . 95% your 40+ characters personality wood stool . some characters literally say ' i join your party ' than join never say anything else ever again ! 44 playable characters instead 7 spreads each one way too thin makes them all lose individuality . end this game still one greatest rpgs ever made first playstation . while its few flaws keep it true classic , it still one greatest rpg experiences past 5 years .	1

this game great . i mean it might just like last years game all , but still it pretty cool . i like graphics . they don't show great detail , but they suffice . new momentum meter nothing special . it doesn't help you or anything . it just tells you who doing better game . new emotions expressed players really helps you know tempo game . one thing sort con this year campus legend mode . that really only reason i bought this game . i really don't like college football team well enough franchise it . i like csu though , so i might try it . but anyway , campus legend mode lets you normal thing . pick your position instence . you get lots drills your position this year . good some , bad most . also , you pick major . what up ? i mean , college football rough enough but study major ? unbelieveable . then they expect you remember all stuff you studied take two tests it each year . i got so frustrated i failing chemistry i started write all answers down . so i'm doing better now . trust me though , this game fun play random games your college team or guess franchise your favorite college team , but please , if you want make all-star football player , just go out but ncaa football 2006 . way more easier	1
this game long time making , given cultural popularity western genre , it surprising western-themed video game should take so long come market . i this game long time , but only recently got play it , when i finally got into it , it enormously entertaining i loved lot spaghetti-western themed humor musical score . game , you control variety characters ( many whom introduced superb opening sequence , which plays much like opening credits sergio leone western ) . most time , you play part red harlow , half-breed bounty hunter mission hunt down his parents ' murderers . ( sound familiar ? ) you'll also get chance control variety other western archetypes , such expert pistoleer english dandy , sharpshooting , spitfire rancher daughter , indian cousin red harlow ( who dresses like iroquois instead sioux or other plains indian - but i'm nitpicking ) , negro buffalo soldier , you even get play bad guy when you assume role renegade mexican general . gameplay itself took little time get used . instance , draw your gun , you must press button down , keep it held down while pressing button shoot . if you let go button which draws your gun , your character holster his gun again . this one quirks which made initially difficult learning curve . however , once controls mastered , combat actually surprisingly easy . you duck , hide behond cover , dive/roll , jump . when guns holstered , you even punch kick - one my favorite sequences whole game bar brawl ( more stereotypical western scenes ! ) where you cannot use your guns , but must use fists feet ( occassionally broken whiskey bottles ) fight your way safety . addition " normal " combat , there " showdown " mode which dedicated quick-drawing against one or more opponents . highlight this feature " tournament " ( which seems inspired movie " quick dead " ) where you battle ever-faster enemies until you win . this mode sometimes very frustrating you may replay again again . overall , graphics okay - what helps make this title fact makers put grainy , old-style matinee look ( like game movie played old-style ( worn out ) projector , complete hairlines picture moving off-center times . this little touch very endearing . while this title may not lot replay value , it still immensely fun i would recommend it highly .	1
this game rivals battlefront 2 all time greatest star wars game ver made . this game very similar halo its 1st person concept w/ hud . every level different lots strategic tasks . graphics gameplay awsome . i can't wait this game 360 compatible .	1

great uncomplicated game decent graphics just right amount quot ; spookinessquot ; . i loved puzzles which weren't overly difficult solve hint system very very good helping me get over one or two puzzles which not seem make sense . marble-in-the-hole game little irritating but all other puzzles solvable even trial error basis . this game probably not people who like complex plots puzzles but game novice i enjoyed it little disappointed when game ended ( little abruptly ! )	-1
i read previous reviews other reviews this games , i agree some disagree others . i like whole story line game . it gave us insight into history jr gaignun shion . i very disappointed overall combat system . i liked changing characters middle combat like ff-x , but i miss ability hit enemies special weapons like first episode . i also disappointed way creators changed way build characters first episode second . i liked characters different abilities . it added diversity building strong team . i didn't care too much good samaritan side quests . i didn't like go all over place pick up stuff vital development my characters or advance game . ability two characters attack during combat using special attacks interesting even though i didn't use it much . far characters themselves , i agree reviewer shion . i also found her bossy cold . certain scenes , i found her too emotional . most her lines near end completely out place especially end after jr showdown albedo . ( i disappointed when my most favorite npc gaignun possessed , but that just me . ) i agree one reviewer voice momo although i like some her lines . i very happy creator took away her wand give her weapon . it made her very useful combat . chaos too laid back me this game kos-mos too much vain side . i like how reaction shion jin or kos-mos before combat starts . overall game enjoyable play . once i got pass disappointing aspects game , i found it very entertaining	-1
... graphics pretty imbarasing . object game get snapshots you get these snapshots completing missions , levels , hero times ( specific mission you use one character ) . some levels fun , like far , far , away level(it grand theft auto theme ) . i give graphics 3/5 ( i think they should better job main characters ) , audio 4/5 , gameplay 4.5 /5 , fun 4.5 /5 , overall 3/5 .	-1
i saw ad city life i clicked it . i read it thought it sounded so much better than sim city 4 ( which i currently own ) i decided download try demo . demo so much fun , it many features . what gives this game unique twist social cliques . you meet needs each cliques , example different types jobs they need . what makes it realistic , it just like real life . blue collars dont want live next fringes , whereas rich don't want live next poor , or homeless . what supprised me most this game though 3d graphics . you zoom out get eye level " people " you see them reading paper their picnic table their backyard , or walking down street , or taking trash out . neat feature how easy it zone . zoning such improvement over sc4 . this game makes you auctually get involved your community , making it your perfect town . now all i am waiting my copy game come . 1- least ........................... 10-bestgraphics : 8simplicity : 9fun : 10realistic : 9overall great game those who tired waiting sc5 or , those who just starting out city simulation games	1

lemony game not hardcore gamers . it doesn't aspire . it shouldn't compared warcraft or resident evil 4 . game developed amaze activision . any one familiar first three harry potter movie o-o rdinated games ( through electronic arts ea games ) familiar amaze . first three potter games fun bit challenge children those adults who new pc gaming . player wandered around magical world hogwarts , collecting jelly beans wizard cards . what fun not completeing tasks or learning new magic , what fun freedom discover new areas find secret places . fans potter games recognize same mechanics gameplay outfitted new location , jelly beans replaced golden eyes , golden hearts refuel stamina instead chocolate frogs , playbills letters granted instead wizard cards . players also recognize flavor wonderful score game set , enjoyable , appropiate , but not overbearing some familiar notes . lemony isn't quite good aforementioned potter games . reason lemony not fun story . while ficticious , lemony story relentless abuse three very droll very wealthy orphans . its much more fun play boy , who left his abusive aunt uncle behind , entering magical world educated hogwarts . i rather enjoyed learning how fly buckbeak prizoner azkaban . lemony , i'm rather relieved i solved train signal puzzle , thought children run over over over train until i , depressing me . yet , lemony provide some consolation those who disappointed ea latest potter offering , goblet fire . while there adjustment droll circumstances , task discovering your world take over game eventually command your attention . while lemony isn't bad , it isn't good , either . they renderings children not most flattering they could , villians boorishly ugly . gameplay controls aren't half good potter games , they weren't greatest . there match game puzzle cellar , only shows up per every install , instead every game . i complete it nothing happened my game , which maybe reason puzzle won't show up rest games particular installation . it this twice me , i'm not going uninstall install third time see if it happens again . it no effect my score or letter or eye collecting . camera angles aren't well mapped shooting . i supposed shoot rat , but camera got behind ceiling lamp , while rat biting me , all i could see inside lamp shade . suff like . still its better than most children games out there , it plays ! you may guessed , there violence . when i shoot rat lemony , it shot rotten egg lobber . rotten eggs your bullets , player stuns enemies , instead killing them . time . i've played lemony three times , third time it going through motions . once few skills jumping , aiming egg lobber , boot puncher mastered , there wasn't any interest left . but time i play , i enjoy it . games amaze category unto themselves . they not action games based trigger finger , nor they point click boring adventure games beset brain teaser puzzles futuristic world . they relaxing time where you don't test your brain , just delight it . if you never played potter games new pc gaming i recommend lemony , it good place start . if you fellow potterhead felt betrayed buy goblet fire , lemony sustain you .	-1
i'm not going into storyline , becuase it obivously spoil it those who haven't oppurtunity play this excellent game . final fantasy first game final fantasy series released playstation 2 . graphics here sharp crisp , no fuzzness or distortions . voice actors actually good job , doesn't sound like those old kung-fu movies where tone voices ] don't match person appearnace . battle system simple use they offer tutorials within menu case you're still confused . i'm really pleased results i see myself playing this game over over again	1
late 04 i decided give purchase gaming system time original xbox . not real dedicated gamer previously only played ( never owned ) systems i little knowledge how it'd upon use -- but since halo 2 just released rave reviews i knew i try it out ( hey , it halo , people ! ) . man , i glad i invested it ! it bit large ( compared my best friend ps2 ) bit difficult lug someplace , but graphics much better than ps2 games available it great ( significantly critically acclaimed halo series , course , best game out there my opinion ) . there some issues how bulky system but it quality gaming rather than how bulky gaming system	1
this game , simply put , not good . i got bored tears playing it , then ended up giving it away because it robbing useful space my desk . it slow-paced , predictable , not suspenseful all . fact , these characteristics probably why it so mainstream , even though it laughable comparison real first-person shooters , which way don't even belong consoles . owning this game means you average player . any true fps gamer knows what childish , pathetic garbage this , while rest just go hype . many successfully deceived themselves into thinking it worth anything all . it isn't	-1
i really wanted like this game .. unfortunately me , it blows . i'd trade it migraine if i could . gameplay pretty horrible , sword scenes reminiscent pc adventure games circa 1992 , where you press " attack " key swing your sword aimlessly bad-guy . run gun part game nothing write home either . it feels like teleported into body cracked-out , 1 legged , drunken monkey . also , i know graphics aren't wii strong-point , but no excuse regress back 8-bit . when you're trying shoot someone across room , it really sucks when you can't tell them apart flower pot ..... or lawn chair ? cut scene obviously supposed look like sin city . i stress word supposed cause they probably strung together some poor intern after development team went into hiding . they look like amateur flash slide-show . kinda like what your local mom pop video editor would put together if your little nephew gotten his way sin city themed bar mitzvah . this game joke . anybody associated it should embarrassed .	-1
i'll make this short sweet you . i went cyber cafe so i play this " gem " see what all fuss this game . overrated . i no idea how people prais this " best game world !!

i really looking forward this game , i prepared overlook one or two things . every game it own personality , right ? i found instead this game actually doesn't much one all . i didn't mind graphics . not cutting edge sure , but not bad either . little muddy but change cartoony . it hard enjoy closeup views , however , when so many buildings lost their roof zoom . no way toggle feature . camera angles frustrating it very difficult pick anything out mouse accurately . not there much time look scenery . immigrants came . came . came . whether there houses jobs available or not . long city happiness high enough , which meant everyone happy . which they not . because they no houses or jobs . keep city happiness up only way ensure somewhat stable economy . forget planning . forget balancing resources workshops markets . it wasn't clear what balance any case . it would take trial error , you didn't time . you building worshops like mad , trying guess how many citizens would employed each , researching temporary bumps keep your city deserted droves . best income boosts not through sale goods or trade . it through research , maximising tax base development currency so . you hit those early , reached certain population level , you made money . rest time you spent trying keep people leaving . there no stability reaching any level . it quickly became game keep up . there no way control immigration or set pace development . all decorative options , more than similar games out , you really didn't care end what your city looked like , because it just cost time . money too , but really not relevant issue . unless people unhappy . then you could stick few things , quickly , somewhere . you just can't enjoy leisurely pace planning , building finishing it off nudge here there watching it run ... you constantly involved process , staying ahead curve . you don't worry maintenance , such city fires or engineers , but cities cannot not made self-sufficient or self-sustaining this inherent instability built into gameplay . five or ten minutes away screen bring most cities , if not all , screeching halt . while i enjoyed research options , ability move homes i thought great innovation , not ability control flow immigrants city pegging success city happiness makes this game poor economic simulation gameplay ultimately very shallow unsatisfying .	-1

easy ... boring ... bugs , bugs , bugs , glitches , glitches , glitches ... question ??? this new game , or possible bonus maps cod2 they decided make into new game profit more money ???? hmmmm ??? positive ?? you cook your grenades now . i like mine medium rare ... possibly useful online matches , apposed cod2 where you couldn't it point less throw grenade online matches because you knew where it could just move . but i never know , because i " thankfully " rented damn thing , didn't buy it . wait , i didn't my dad , free rental blockbuster . so they didn't get any my hardly earned money . good me ... also could anyone tell me why i kept getting stuck walls , tanks , people , just everything . i think i stuck air ... if you like this game , you need get f**k out , buy something else play , i so i meet up you beat you ... also , if you don't like my run sentences you .... yep you guess it ... get f**k out .	-1

bought this platinum game much anticipation it doesn't work all . tried download . exe patch nothing top it off half original game forum sites crash too . no one any idea how fix this game all you look dozen patches out first game . if they spent time money build game test it right like blizzard companies like westwood then they would release finished game but decided use everyone gunea pigs test product so they could try patch it work . not buy anything this company or its affiliates i think they alkida implants trying take over western world . if you want play game style then wait until june get " titan quest " which should finally diablo 3 . too bad this company couldn't find capital complete game before release would think anyone wanting buy spellforce 2 should warned upfront make sure you wait 6 months after release buy additional hard drive so you download new patch fixes they probably try smoke screen you they count their money send it iran	-1

karaoke revolution party fantastic game great songs , great easy gameplay perfect party game features . if you've never tried karaoke game , now time play . first , basic setup . you get fully customize your character . we're talking black , white , male , female , heavy , skinny , athletic . then you go hair styles , hair colors , outfits down shoes jewelry . you evey use your eyetoy scan your face onto face character . it simply amazing . then we go onto song list . i own probably every karaoke game out 3 main systems . i love karaoke games . this song list far my favorite song list all time - it true my boyfriend well . there good mix jumping songs , slow romantic songs , rocking songs more . other karaoke games you go through unlocking venues songs . because this party game , they pretty much give you everything up front , few exceptions . you unlock few songs ton characters / outfits you go , keep things interesting . few standouts include elvis outfit cat outfit . addition able sing both single player duet modes , there bunch fun mini-games . you compete against other players , try play note-matching games even set up eye toy so you see your own background game . even better , if you dance pad , you sing dance same time ! this really great building up your vocal powers . many people sing fine if they stand still like stick , but when you sing band you're actually expected move around dance . using dance pad helps you build up your lung power timing so you get those skills . even if you're not band , you see challenges your favorite singers face . this game ton fun both friends party mode , or just singing yourself songs . where some previous versions karaoke sometimes " questionable " versions songs , them obviously different original , these songs great sounding many times i didn't look song bar all sing them . highly , highly recommended !! rating : 5/5note : previous reviewer says this aretha franklin version natural woman . i'm rather sure it carole king version	1
phoenix wright : ace attorney fun game . it simple . graphics ( 4 out 5 ): i would say graphics par most ds games . they could better , but they don't retract all gameplay . they fun same style games like sprung under knife . audio ( 2 out 5 ): audio where most ds games fall short . i am content graphic abilities ds , because quite simply graphics don't make good game . sure they help , but gameplay entertainment truly lies . it knowing this kept nintendo top handheld market . i just wish ds little more power behind it audio sake . i would like speaking characters throughout entire game , especially game like this . music so repetetive , it got so annoying i found myself just turning sound completely off . i guess they best they what they work , but this case , it just not good enough . gameplay ( 5 out 5 ): far gameplay goes , you couldn't ask much better experience . you put role pheonix wright who his first trial defending his best friend who accused murdering his girlfriend . eventually you go work other cases way you required gather evidence use court suppport your defense . characters over top lot fun interact . this text based game i suppose you might fan genre really appreciate it . but it simple pick up play game held my attention beginning end . i really trouble putting it down . while game like sprung got little monotonous came down more memorization then common sense questioning . phoenix stays track area logic plays more part solution cases . i highly reccomend this game !	1
i've my 360 since day one , it worth every dollar . let me start saying there nothing , nothing compares xbox live 360 . microsoft knows online gaming , they know gamer . end month you able download high def movies rent , tv shows free . online community set up help guide you gamers like yourself , people your skill level . sony can't this , ninendo can't this . they try , but xbox doing this years now starting original xbox . so called problems ? all systems them first couple months release , it happenend gamecube , ps2 , we seeing ps3 . i also want mention poster who said not put 360 verticle , not clue . you put it verticle , or horizontal , it works just fine . it turns out , many systems crashing because people got scared rumours , bought nyko cooler . it turn now reported , back pictures , etc . it causing many 360 burn out , it nothing any 360 problems . i personally 360 , soon nintendo wii , i say overall scheme things ... games , online network , options , accessories , etc . you can't beat xbox 360 . not only , sony hype machine wants tell you it graphics better . reality , programmers , 3rd party developers saying they equal graphical power , but you force fed lies hype sony side . not mention much higher price tag . all bs sony , fanboys throw out there . 360 worthy buy ! you really can't go wrong 360 , buy premium , get best game out there ... gears war !	1
i'm 36 years old i played many football video games many different consoles over years i must say this game stands out above all rest ! there " zillion " college teams choose ! stadiums beautifully detailed ! players , coaches , referee models , their animations , superb ! when playing stadium natural grass surface your players get grass mud stains their uniforms ! friend mine my workplace this game longer than i says occasionally player helmet fly off after big hit ! i yet see it happen but i'm looking forward it ! crowds look sound truly alive ! fans celebrate hold up signs ! cheerleaders even teams ' mascot look fantastically detailed their celebrations exciting ! espn college gameday crew , brad nessler , lee corso , kirk herbstreit provide interesting funny game commentary some but not much repetitiveness ! it pretty cool when corso makes his winning pick gameday booth before game he wearing either his picks ' mascot head or teams football helmet he speaking ! overall gameplay great learning curve fairly easy especially if you're familiar madden series ! ncaa 2006 you adjust your game settings , etc . any way you like reset them default touch button!i'm not much into all different options many sports games such creating teams , players , playbooks , making coaching decisions such ( although you all this game ); i play solely visual atmospheric stimulation which this game particular provides ! my opinion ncaa football 2006 blows other football titles out water it total package ! football fans , get this game !!! you feel like you involved actual college football game complete all emotion pageantry ! you become addicted it you want play it over over again !	1
leave it me start into series its ' second , third , or fourth installments . this case , it fourth . course , there good explanation why . i set out looking final fantasy iii : dawn souls my gameboy advance(hey , if you're going collect series , it good thing start beginning ) my local videogame store but they only final fantasy iv advance so i decided get it instead . there isn't much i say hasn't already said other reviewers here final fantasy iv advance . story goes like this .. kingdom baron quest collect all elemental crystals . commander its air force , cecil , dismissed after questioning king motives . help others ; cecil sets out stop growing threat , meantime , uncovers far more dangerous one . it deep story alot twists turns deeply challenging game due active time battle system . i can't recommend this game enough . it one my all-time favorite final fantasy games . although they tweaked graphics , translation whatnot abit , they pretty much made game it originally . i think final fantasy fans well casual rpg gamers really enjoy this one .	1
microsoft created extraordinary machine . crisp graphics so far library games available impressive . only problem i microsoft produced defective product . first few months it played fine only aa couple moments where games would freeze . no biggie . then it died . no problem , sent it repairs under warranty . free charge . cool . got it back it played well me actually beating ghost recon no problems . i stopped playing while but when i tried playing again bam ! ring death . warranty over . $130-140 dollars fix . yay . i think i'm going throw it against wall buy new one . hopefully microsoft found all solutions defects .	1

there two major factions when it comes video games , if you weren't aware their existence i'll happy illucidate you . group 1 , far most numerous , console gamers . group number 2 , one which i subscribe , based pc games . i'll first admit pc gamer i tend view consoles suspicion my experiences they place looks , flash , hefty price tags above gameplay plot . console audience tends younger than pc group , these very aspects which appeal them . so it equal parts hesitation excitement i felt i put this game onto my hard drive . those not know , once upon time , back early days microsoft x-box , there this nifty game called " halo " , my how console gamers snapped it up . i saw commercials tv course , thought it looked pretty good , but felt it too bad it x-box title not one available my trusty ol ' pc . " halo " puts player squarely armored shoes master chief , one kind super-marine engineered bring big guns covenant , consortium deranged religious aliens bent destruction all humanity . no ship allowed go earth it location closely held secret which covenant wishes possess all costs . but earth losing war , precipitating creation new super soldier , spartan-ii . just before spartan used covenant home planet latter launches surprise attack facility destroys all but one ; you . gambit elude pursuit last ship left , pillar autumn , jumps into hyperspace ends up orbit around strange ringworld named halo , but immediately attacked their pursuers , who seem tracked down autumn no time . now , complaint number one i this game stems fact * everything * i just described not taken game itself . it comes game manual . plot this interesting should least included opening scenes . c'mon microsoft , you money , pony it up spruce up introduction . it good plotline , so don't waste it manual , which only kept desk drawer some juvenile next 10 years forgotten until next decade spring cleaning . plot ( first gripe ) now aside , let focus game itself . i refuse judge game it age , too many nowadays ... instance , i still play original half-life think plot gameplay more than make up aged graphics . game looked fine my pc i never experienced anything close screen lag . colors contours alien world ship hallways nicely rendered sound ambient noise above average . music itself nice choral sequences ( such featured menu screen ) downright cheap midi sounding music , which felt out sorts rest game . weapons selection small but surprisingly good , any given situation you'll likely access weapon/s needed surmount it . i particularly like plasma pistol it supercharged shots , well everlasting mainstay fps games , shotgun . ability drive vehicles included game , something separates halo most other fps , it lot fun . particular i loved driving scorpion tank , which demolishes everything it path . you also fly around enemy banshee light fighter , which made getting past couple levels much easier . game plot flows smoothly voice acting pretty good . now gripes . right off bat i say level design single biggest detraction this game . beautiful outdoor environments used this game , but not * nearly * enough . you'll spend most it traversing hallway after hallway , which connect rooms look * identical * one you just left . doing this 2-3 times enough , but when you spread out level runs outwards up 3 hours * same thing * , it gets reaaaally stale . case point , chapter/s which you spend time monitor traveling through library . this section game draining seemed without end . it wasn't fun , just stressful . level which player introduced flood felt much same , although it still lot fun . vehicles fun , but require mouse steer . this obviously remnant x-box , where players steer warthog control toggle-thing , but i found mostly it me skidding against walls occasionally flipping . ghost only vehicle i able use strafe keys assist steering . enemies themselves tend get little stale after while , during my first couple hours playing i wondered what i gotten myself into . grunts , little pointy-backed gnomish aliens , spend most their time running away speaking ewok-accented english . it very distracting considering nature other baddies they seemed little out place . lumbering hunter , who super armored , also incredibly stupid . first i trouble negotiating them , but soon learned employing certain attack patterns i could easily waste one under minute . other aliens tend use good combat tactics i found dealing them more difficult . plot itself , which i classify very good , bordering great , kept me interested . it ain't half-life , but it works well enough my curiousity piqued halo 2 , which i might go ahead buy near future . i'm sure halo released pc first , which what originally intended , it'd left recognizable mark fps shooter platform . so that . very good game one which i look forward continuing storyline master chief , killer extraordinaire !	-1

nfsu capture idea ' building racing cars ' but i think they could go little further into design your so-called ' pimp-mobile ' . only interior you get design trunk , i think they could least seats , or wheel . outside design a-ok . anything sideskirts multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce . plot-line single player mode really dosen't go deep , your just some guy who wants get his title back . multi-player you race your own cars tracks you already won , but down-side whole graphics two player horrible . it game worth getting , but you might sell it later .	-1

one might suspect gta : san adreas classic anarchist fun insane driving , guns galore lawless protagonist , linear storyline . let honest though ; nobody buys gta just play mission part fact i hard time getting into missions . san andreas there even larger area gameplay few other cities explore once you advanced game ( unless you want cheat ) . clear aspect sets this game apart previous ones depth gameplay . haircuts tattoos available purchase . you various parts your character built up -- fat , hunger , muscle , driving skill , weapon skill etc . obviously when you get fat you need run around eat when hungry . others self explanatory . some new rather interesting vehicles ave added this game . hydra , which harrier type jet , stunt plane , attack helicopter , four wheeler , parachute , my favorite -- jetpack . other than game like each created before it gta 3 . graphics even fairly modern computer still leave much desired . whatever engine they use clearly same gta 3 . animation other hand very natural realistic . music radio stations lackluster , but i believe it possible use your own music instead . computer game san adreas ' controls very least awkward because sheer number actions . worst case scenario -- hydra -- however using keyboard fly plane downright nerveracking . if you want shoot something below you , sure compensate couple seconds , not because it moves fast but because you need time angle nose plane direction . i , myself use xbox controller which adapter use usb port computer . even it not much better you still need d-pad make decent turns . you tell this my biggest qualm game . overall grand theft auto : san andreas lot offer if you don't regular gaming console but compensated clumsy keyboard controls . i would rate it 7 out 10	1
if you enjoy series you love game ... simple . very entertaining . don't miss it	1
let me say yes , this game too violent kids but beyond , it totally awesome ! graphics better than those found san andreas i enjoy robbing stores greatly ! you also notice your health armor decline more rapidly this game than sa . ok , so it not three super detailed cities but it one nearly perfect city ... vice city perfect parody 1980s miami missions seem pretty reflective . storyline what you would expect but voice over acting exceptional videogame . two main characters , tommy lance , sound better than characters most major motion pictures . i started my adventures gta san andreas but fact , i am enjoying this game even more ! anyone who liked either gta iii or san andreas , pick this up way , avoid lib city stories , it just too dull after while	1
this game took my 9 year old son 2 days complete . it disappointment since i paid $30 it , but action adventure games make younger kids make wiser decisions . overall this game deserves a+ . not adult type game but fun kids .	1

i unlike lot other people not buy this game when it first came out . my initial thought what squar thinking . i thinking this could nothing more than childs game . it wasnt until i talked number other people , right before kh2 came out i finaly listen all those people spend $20 get game , ( price game then , ) low behold , time i finished watching just opening scene i hooked . i played game what seemed like hours , ( it really only very long weekend . ) but game became so addicting i immediatly went out bought second one day it came out . story line par final fantasy , final fantasy vii , my two favorit games world . i would recomend this game anyone even slightes bit imagination . if you even dare dream you instantly love this game i . it well worth price , my only regret i not buy it sooner	1
don't listen other reviewers . this game great . far beats out sim city 4(and i game ) . it challenging make everybody happy , but if game easy .. it wouldn't fun	1
i believe this best game genre . it gotten more play out me than master magic , heroes might magic , age wonders , warlords , disciples , civilization , alpha centauri , master orion , space empires , or stars . once other posters says they bad support , but that not my experience . i've found their continued support patches good or better than any afore mentioned titles -- not bad 2 man team . there amazing amount variety factions would-be-gods you play , best all it most part solidly based upon mythology -- far superior typically dd derivative fantasy . multiplayer fantastic . it complex game however , not everyone tastes . definitely check out demo first . beware though , it addictive stuff ! also check out fan made maps their website well , some which quite pretty . if you're stuck getting started , try excellent walkthrough bruce geryk , also linked their site	1

castlevania : dawn sorrow first 2d version castlevania , i played long time . well onest , first one since castlevania ii : belmonts quest , came out nes back 80 . i never got play super castlevania , or amazing psx versions(which i should , after playing this game , buying 2 previous gba games ) . this amazing change ot games me . original , it really hard beat , made you frustrated . ii fixed it little , made you search dracula body , then destroy it , but frustrating , you no real direction most weapons tended suck . this however , amazing game . it eases you into game , you lot hp your disposal , regain them(take 1980 games ) quite often , potions , or save point , or souls . souls great thing , am loving it previous game well . they range you not taking much damage , growing tail , shooting lightning or bombs , letting you throw doll , switch places it . i enjoyed this game , determined finish it . i don't currently 100% , but my first time through i got 98% which nice , because i played games through , you finish 48% you completed entire game . touch screen not used often game , but when it used it used well . you only need it destroy few blocks way , input magic seals whihc you need defeat bosses get through certain doors . it plays great , although you cheat not hit points perfect , long your quick(which good thing , most people not perfectionists , or if they , really slow ) . game difficult , but not overbearing like many series past . i loved this game , play it long time , even though i beaten it before . i try julius mode , which more traditional , difficult castlevania game using belmont(finally ) whip , no souls , no potions , it tough , but i enjoy it greatly . if you own ds , you need own this game	-1
xenosaga ii-jenseits von gut und boese came november europe first xenosaga , which released here !!! but we european players never played xenosaga i before , so namco released second xenosaga great " special box " . this box game itself movie-dvd nearly all xenosaga i movies . back topic , my opinion xenosaga ii pretty game cool movies battle system makes fun . music this game composed yuki kajiura movies shinji hosoe rest game . i think kajiuras music really good but shinji hosoe bad job , his elevator music ;o )the graphics okay but i couldn't see anything outstanding . end i must say , xenosaga ii good rpg , even if it not so wonderful than first xenosaga . that reason , why i imported xenosaga i your country ^_ ~ but last most pal-players happy , actually ( my dictionary doesn't give me right english translation " ueberhaupt " ;_; sorry ) xenosaga ii come europe yet !!!! so i look forward third last xenosaga hope , this episode like first !!!! many greets germany ..... viele gruee aus deutschland ^	-1
this probably one my least favorite ff games psone . there some good things some bad things this game . first bad : 1 . squaresoft ( now square enix , goddammit ! ) trying get old roots snes games . me anyway , it doesn't look entirely like those games . 2 . some characters worst ff games ' history ( quina , eiko , garnet . i am not sexist , it just their abilities suck their type combat terrible ) . other characters good , not great , but decent . 3 . i don't care too much character models ( deformation final fantasy 8 graphics mix ) . okay good parts game : 1 . cinemas !!! they look really good psone game , most games cinemas psone don't look great this era gaming even some during era . 2 . ending !! i am not saying anymore . 3 . battle system . it not quite ff8 not quite ff7 but it trance system thingy . after this game , i sadly am seeing series not good it once ( i like final fantasy crystal chronicals can't wait remake ff3 ds ) , final fantasy 10 isn't legendary , ff 11 , which i never never play ( because fees , reminds me too much like phantasy star online ( i like game though ) , not much single player expericence no storyline ) , ff 12 just because it ff11 battle engine , looks like ffcc ff10 mixed together , i just seem not care much newer ff games anymore . so i would recommend any ff game psone ( including psone ports snes games origins ) because they so great even if games don't best graphics world , it gameplay storylines count	1
i'm avid final fantasy ( ff ) fan . when i found out they making game devoted my favorite male character , vincent valentine , i stoked . after pre-ordering this game , waiting forever get it , i expecting usual action-packed fighting detailed storyline seen almost all ff games . sadly , though , i little disappointed . dirge cerberus first person shooter ( just you , armed enemies lotta guns ) based final fantasy vii character , vincent . gameplay pretty decent , multitude different enemies fast-paced gameplay ... times . graphics , however , biiiiiiig let down after initial fmv sequence . guns pretty basic far usage , but equiptment system confusing materia system just plain weird first . i'm not even going start item limits ... game isn't overly difficult or overly easy offers few different modes gameplay , easy-hard , unexperienced veteran players . voice acting pretty decent i personally thought voices matched most characters well . now , story . any ff fan should know how much let down these last few ff vii sequels ( movie games ) . they're not bad sense game development or outward beauty , but sense storyline . dirge cerberus takes story complete tangent . lucrecia vincent past given series cut-scenes chance encounters while new , completely out-of-the-blue characters come make difficult process finding out vincent dark history . though it casual flare any ff storyline , it more so resembles two ff movies its science fiction/wannabe horror elements . old characters brought back , new frustrations raised ( hinted ) love interests nothing ever seem go right planet once again . overall , this game isn't bad . it isn't great , but it isn't bad . avid ( very avid ) fans series should check this out if they wanna know what really happened ( though they should watch carefully things didn't match first game ) . if you're player new series , play ff vii first or you won't get full impact game . if you don't really care just checking this out heck it , don't buy it . your money better spent good first-person shooter like metal gear solid	-1
first glance average person might assume appeal grand theft auto graphic violence , swearing mature content but truth gta series revolutionary technological achievement remains one most impressive experiences you find gaming . first time i ever tried gta : liberty city i absolutely blown away size scope fully realized , living city . it same feeling i got first time i played mario 64 i recognized i witnessing major leap forward . now almost 10 years later rockstar treated us their latest effort , gta : san andreas . liberty city prototypical big east coast city while vice city combination vegas southern florida . san andreas takes gamers west coast shades san francisco , la points . always city gigantic fully realized way true crime series could only dream . fact i noticed billboard san andreas mocking true crime . gta always freedom ; freedom walk , drive or bicycle wherever you want , freedom walk up pop someone mouth if you want . sure it violent but consider it wish fulfillment those us inner anarchist who desires expression without messiness accountability . only other game even approached gta scale mafia but mafia saddled unforgiving law enforcement wouldn't even allow players run red lights . unfortunately , not everything sunshine palm trees san andreas . vehicles extremely difficult control . problem vehicle movement camera angle work independently which means when you make turn using keyboard you quickly swing camera around using mouse realign yourself . even after considerable practice i still found it very challenging awkward . shooting likewise rather challenging perform i just don't remember it this hard two previous games . other surprise how taxing game my pc . i played first two gta significantly weaker machine surprised i couldn't max out all settings san andreas . i pull drawing distance significantly keep frame rate up while using p4 3.0 ghz 1 gig memory ati radeon x600 graphics card . i knock one star off because awkward controls but gta one those games you could spend month never get board . just exploring city worth price admission .	-1

when i think entire series such final fantasy , this game always seems odd one out . ffviii not take medieval or archaic look others series . i hardly agree gamers who not see potential this game . ff8 takes lot unique elements more noticeable than other ff games . one elements very unusual storyline . my opinion , storyline rather impressive . though it overshadows blossoming love 2 main characters , there not lot predictability storyline . no hidden characters no actual villain remains same throughout game . element gameplay . characters able draw distribute elements little more refreshing use than materia junction systems previous ffs . graphics final fantasy 8 very exquisite . cutscenes enough illustrate game without drawing away gameplay . i especially enjoy soundtrack game . i mix all video game music my ipod often am confused which game it comes . ff8 distinguished composition makes it stand out other video games . lot gamers know , ff8 takes series direction other games not take . lack mini-games definitely issue . while triple triad fun addictive take , it hassle reload or restart game if you lose valuable cards . also , trading some these valuable cards items hassle too . i found myself desperate need invincibles use defense against final boss . guardian forces ( almost forgot them ) exciting acquire too . spending numerous time sidequests should not requirement beat game though . also , ff8 spends little interest developing secondary characters but i praise excellence overall dialogue writing . give ff8 shot favor yourself gamers who feel like it definite miss	-1
eye toy play 2 much better than first . while first limits what you could actually , this one very few . there much larger variety games , different activities . such running during baseball game , dodging searchlights while collecting items , chopping pickles smashing tomatoes , defeating three-headed hydra so much more . during multiplayer mode , you get take picture your face which then placed head robot monkey , which hilarious touch . also , during multi-player mode , when tie occurs , players get tie breaker form fun little mini game . downside this , if you want play minigames anytime , you force tie , which pain . downsides eye toy play 2 : some games more frustrating than challenging , instrutions booklet aren't very clear . like most eye toy games , you turn all lights nearby open curtains get decent enough lighting . even when camera set dim room . video messaging terrible . you don't get choose background like original eye toy , image small distorted . playroom difficult find , there limited ammount games , some which make no sense . like , when it asks you put brightly coloured image front camera . it just weird . overall , eye toy play 2 completely worth buy . it hours endless fun , games never seem get old	1

this unique game takes keen eye ability remember small details . many times , whether or not you're successful depend how good you finding inconsistencies testimony , or things " just don't sound right " . animation very lo-tech , where each scene just stationary backdrop . if there character you interacting , they cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states it suits dialog . there * lot * reading , unfortunately , some characters love talk . music simple infectious , interface easy navigate either via touch stylus or buttons , you save your state game any time , so you take cases your own pace . it unique game just rewarding it frustrating . characters interesting , if you own ds , this game worth	-1

i'm not huge fps fan but every once while i need fulfill my animalistic urges blow something up lay waste others . farcry beautiful game topped only its playability . ai " smart " sneak around flank , call backup , sound alarms , etc ... instead just barrleing straight you . couple times i've made mistake focusing one guy or area enemy pop up right my face side . graphics amazing ! my comp isn't beast , it pretty standard today means , but i put 256mb geforce graphics card . standing top hill everything miles away still crystal clear detailing hasn't diminished all , it absolutely gorgeous . physics game great operate realistically . get this game , you won't disappointed	1
i won't say cooking mama best game i've played recent months . surely , there something more important than cooking - like , killing zombies x360 , example . however , it certainly most innovative , especially when you consider how much you limited dimensions nintendo ds touch screen . cooking mama , you're apprentice fine art cuisine management . your master , certain mama , put you through series saliva-inducing recipes , grill you through preparation each if it only thing you live . you choose practise before hand , but when you go into actual process making particular food , you'll find there no room error . wrong move , mama not hesitate show you her wrath . making food involves several steps . some short , while some may take forever . example , when preparing pan-fried fish , you'll go through coating fish slices , melting butter , actual pan-frying arranging plate . each process turn involves different ways doing things . coating fish slices , example , requires you drag your stylus left-right manner while touching fish . melting butter requires you rapidly drag butter circular motion when it hot plate . pan-frying involves " following command on-screen " mini-game requires you perform whatever mama tells you , so . impressive thing here , even though you're just stroking your stylus throughout game 70+ recipes , you're essentially doing different things . it bit like trauma centre last year , but instead seeing body parts , you're looking food . if you're more adventurous , you even combine recipes form new ones , which adds depth gameplay . game quirky this , it understandable it uses quirky graphics . presentation cooking mama light-hearted , makes hectic process cooking ( me , least ) much more enjoyable . music little weak , even though it some nice variety . but seriously , graphics audios not what you'd buy this game . i mean , who cares these things when you've fried octopus balls make ? its sheer audacity bringing kitchen onto ds , i'd recommend cooking mama every owner ds . don't expect see your ds few weeks , however , if you bought this game , missus house . now , if only my wife learn few tips out this	1
this first time i owned madden football game . i can't compare it other games , but this one rocks ! i love highlight stick hit stick . pros : good graphics , great commentary , very fun cons : if you challenge play , it never gets reversed . it only gets reversed if other team challenges . notice i only 1 con , so this game must get xbox !	1
this one awesome game ... play it online or against computer .. i suggest online more fun long run ... if you really wanna give yourself scare turn out lights turn up volume ... definetely scariest first person shooter out there	1
red dead revolver , far , one best western games i've ever played . game easy learning curve also . after hour or so play you all controls down , you'll hooked or otherwise very interested . it one best story-lines out any other games i know . basically , western tale revenge renegade southern general his colonel . you play red harlow whose father brutally murdered right front him colonel darien , again , general diego right hand man . i wouldn't say this game bad rating makes it . there no actual dismemberment , rating " blood gore " says , use curse words kept minimum . if you've seen any pg-13 rated movies , two could relate . it fun time killing game , if you're bored , great replay value people who don't plan finishing single player modes . there tons characters choose multiplayer mode , both good bad . multiplayer modes numerous also , including things like showdown dueling modes . downfalls this game short story mode overall simpleness it . there aren't many ways you get creative it . but , greatest thing it i believe : sheer hilariousness it ! me friend sat played it more than 4 hours night once , sat holding our sides , crying , because laughter . midget clowns character reactions funny . especially how it sometimes glitches up . once during boss fight very fat character , fat enemy got hung stairwell , because he too big go through it . overall very good game ! you should buy this , if you like this game , you may want purchase gun too . gun copied off red dead revolver most part though . both games very short stories too . if you like good western great replay value , then you certainy love red dead	-1

while shin megami tensei devil summoner : raidou kuzunoha vs soulless army isn't actually smt game , it member franchise . it actually part family spin-off games megaten series just using smt name establish connections different series franchise finally appearing america . while not too many people familiar games past , this one takes series new direction . devil summoner first game megaten franchise moved past traditional or tactical rpg style combat gone straight into action/rpg genre . this game you play young man who just attained title kuzunoha raidou 14th , successor long line devil summoners tasked protection capital city . his ability see control demons , raidou must solve mystery becomes increasingly more more twisted game progresses . story begins player earning raidou name ( essentially this tutorial ) assigned work detective agency capital . one day you get mysterious phonecall girl pleading help wants meet you late night . reluctantly raidou his partner detective agency head out meet her . they find out girl who contacted them odd request ; she asks them kill her . before anyone respond , she kidnapped mysterious men red so sets forth tale demons , evil , curses . essentially game progresses much way you would expect megaten game , you travel different locations via world maps explore different locations larger area maps . while wandering around areas searching clues information , there several random encounters ( franchise known high encounter rates ) allow you opportunities capture new demons aid . more later though . while exploring areas you able demon deployed follow you around ( keep mind normal people can't see it though ) . every demon type special skills used areas such flying reach far items , scouting find hidden items enemy info , even mind reading get some extra information people . these skills essential getting information you need , so it wise keep demon every type often possible . now battles . this where fans series either love game or hate it . gone pressed turn systems used nocturne digital devil saga . instead they replaced real time action battles . you directly control raidou use combinations sword strikes gun shots defeat your enemies . raidou can't use magic , so only way he deal elemental damage using special bullets . luckily him though , he able demon deployed him battle ( but only one ! ) . it typically act its own , but you capable assigning it specific orders or general strategies . using your monsters battle , they grow loyalty you . when their loyalty maxed out , they often give you bonuses then used fusions create new demons . essentailly system get little bit repetitive while it takes while get used , once you it becomes matter knowing what enemies weak which attacks . once you figure out though , it just matter keeping your levels high enough capturing fusing demons keep gaining strength . style capturing brand new well . gone negotiation system used nocturne original smt games . instead it replaced system forces you exploit enemy weaknesses . when you hit enemy element it weak too , it become stunned give you chance capture it repeatedly pressing circle until meter empties out . you must empty meter before creature revives or you not capture it . easiest way this wear down its health ahead time before attempting capture . one note though , you automatically fail capture if enemy higher level than raidou , moon full , or it boss battle . graphics music game little different what seen previous smt releases here north america . it still uses same form cel shading , but they little bit more defined detailed . nothing too major , but it enough really change visuals overall appearance other games . also , this game not dark gritty nocturne or dds . fact it several amusing scenes much brighter more vibrant overall . this greatly illustrated music which often much more lighthearted comprised lot horns brass instruments . not nearly dark brooding other two games . but since this game takes place 1920 japan not post-apocalyptic world this time , it fits quite well . overall , devil summoner new spin old franchise . while it display full action battles aren't well suited style game , atlus able it well enough it still remains fun keeps game enjoyable . lot people who found turn based systems nocturne dds overbearing cumbersome , this could nice way ease into world megaten franchise . while it not nearly epic previous games , it holds its own story alone enough keep fan franchise sated long enough finish game off regardless whether or not they like change style . definately not best game franchise , but nice refreshing change fun none less .	-1
first off i own both nba 2k6 nba live 2006 playing both since they come out . first i thought nba live 2006 better game until i played nba 2k6 more more realized it best simulation basketball game out there . addition shot stick this year game changes way you shoot well play game . game very enjoyable especially friends because some games get very intense . overall game probably best series because it made major improvement over espn 2k5 . pros-graphics best any basketball game ps2 date . -free throws more realistic you must fluid motion if you shooting free throw yourself . -vip very extensive detailed show your stats tendecies which very nice touch those pay attention detail such myself . cons-steals happen way too often . -very challenging get 15+ rebounds . -practice mode still relatively useless other than perfect your timing your shot .	1
yes this game easier fighting game , but that why i like it personally . most marvel fighting games , there so many controls remember activating many different types superpowers it got hard keep em straight . this game only 2 basic fight options all characters it much easier figure out what you doing . course , each character it little extras such flight storm wall climbing spidey , so each character remains unique . but you don't memorize 10 different actions wolverine then memorize 10 different controls venom . i like this game lot i really love they made fighting controls easier	1
only flaw i find this game multiplayer isn't very much fun . playing locally friend means you just shoot him lot while he learns controls . no enemy ais maps	-1

i believe this best game genre . it gotten more play out me than master magic , heroes might magic , age wonders , warlords , disciples , civilization , alpha centauri , master orion , space empires , or stars . once other posters says they bad support , but that not my experience . i've found their continued support patches good or better than any afore mentioned titles -- not bad 2 man team . there amazing amount variety factions would-be-gods you play , best all it most part solidly based upon mythology -- far superior typically dd derivative fantasy . multiplayer fantastic . it complex game however , not everyone tastes . definitely check out demo first . beware though , it addictive stuff ! also check out fan made maps their website well , some which quite pretty . if you're stuck getting started , try excellent walkthrough bruce geryk , also linked their site	1
way , jak 3 more direct sequel chapter two than it continuation storyline established part one . i realize this meant end journey , " coming age " story follows title character through his innocence , his adolescence , finally his ascent into adulthood . bearing mind , it only natural he'd want distance himself people places make him feel like adventuring child , rather than self-assured saver globes . " when i became man , i put away childish things , " after all . where inspiration behind storytelling jak ii unquestionably blade runner , main source direction this final chapter comes largely mel gibson road warrior . outlanders who rescue title-endorsed duo their exile drag them back their own makeshift shanty town textbook definition early ' 80s burly man . they adorn themselves hundreds pointy edges , enormous , hopelessly detailed weapons layer after layer questionably-hemmed leather . they puff out their chests every opportunity , speak like cluster throat cancer survivors . these new characters just overflowing personality , which makes minor cutscenes motivational speeches entertaining , but i couldn't shake feeling they just going through motions attempt mimic successful main cast second game . it like they trying match edge gritty , sullen warriors jak ii , but missing some intangible element kept them reaching full potential . twists turns their storylines somewhat transparent ( i'd figured out major twist damas story within hour meeting him ) , their importance central plot thrown into question fairly early , ( when you return city around three hour mark only occasionally return desert thereafter ) all their gusto , their emotional impact player doesn't hold candle inner-city gangs ran chapter two . " last " game series , ( daxter psp jak : combat racing since released , continuing saga , there rumors new game ps3 ) jak 3 atypical grand finale . lot things didn't happen i expected during " wrap up " cutscene very end , vice-versa ... i caught off guard more than few revelations , including wizard oz-styled reveal just before final boss . first time , i think series found its stride vein comedy it sought since day one . character interactions actually very funny places - i legitimately laughed out loud more than one occasion , which not something i'm known during game . outline place unexpected twists turns counteracting few more obvious revelations , jak 3 story would set stage one greatest final chapters video gaming history - if only it bit longer . jak 3 weighs dozen hours , which less than half length jak ii , results much less rewarding experience than you'd hope final episode . it also wasn't nearly difficult its immediate predecessor , which means less screaming shouting , but also less relief self-assuredness upon reaching final scene . after completing part two , i sense accomplishment , almost pride , finished such elaborate difficult game . i didn't get same sensation upon putting this one bed . one area which jak 3 doesn't disappoint " holy crap " department . it just spoils you these things - you'll control daxter he clings dear life onto speeding missle , ( live freaking missle ! ) you'll leap onto teensy platform while camera leers above you displays dizzying heights below , you'll take down creatures size whale ... just unimaginably cool stuff . it doesn't overload action quite way god war , but it pretty close , last full hour gameplay one those long moments transcends mere video gaming puts player right into middle summer blockbuster . i've long considered last stage original halo one , if not greatest level history gaming , i'd seriously consider closing moments jak 3 least par . so , yeah , very high praise indeed . both grand finale throughout entirety game , there lot variety gameplay . this not just your standard jump , shoot explore adventure game . you'll bump into odd blend flight stages , ddr-style coordination stages , racing levels railed first person shooter segments , addition exploring , jumping , punching , shooting all-around adventuring levels . , while this something i big problem when it shoved into mechanics grand theft auto : san andreas , it doesn't bother me so much here . main reason because jak series always some sort similar variety ingrained within it , but it also bit more admissible here because setup actually works . nothing feels like it needlessly crammed into proceedings , like dance stages or workout levels san andreas ... it all just works together , several parts whole . while basic gameplay model ( its dedication consistently bending genres ) remained mostly intact , there two notable variations functionality jak ii become abundantly clear within first couple hours . first foremost much , much heavier emphasis that placed driving stages , more so than precursor legacy jak ii combined . this third chapter , they're vital completion half game levels , including final boss fight . it almost point i'd call this " action / racing " title , because you'll find yourself spending much time behind wheel you foot . when it successful , vehicle-based gameplay blast , something that never really tried before - sort supercharged platformer wheels . few stages failed , however , wheels felt like gimmicky death trap . incredibly frustrating , like trying shove square peg through round opening . largely , vehicle stages roaring success , however . secondly , there revelation there " light jak " mirror beastial " dark jak " unveiled second game . where jak darker persona brought it variety new attacks offensive maneuvers , his light side focuses more exploratory aids defensive mechanisms . such , it not quite exciting play " light jak " first time it burst into " dark jak " mode near opening jak ii . it just not much fun grow wings casually flutter around room it fire purple lightning out your fingertips fry opposition . these light powers enable few new modes exploration die-hard fan , but generally fairly useless go unused until situation demands you employ them . fas far controls concerned , it pretty tight ship this point series . most infuriating glitches bugs first game ironed out second chapter , third game actually improves upon near-perfection attained second . few jump commands go unrecognized , i some problems touchy collision detection during faster races ( which meant i hit checkpoint dead center or risk doing it all over again ) but those minor gripes best . visually , this could pass jak ii identical twin . characters look almost exactly same previous chapter , all little quirks , cartoony exaggerations background puns gave first two games their identity here living color . it not best looking game i've ever played , i didn't notice much difference upon switching progressive scan , but it near top its genre all same . i'd imagine phrase " ain't broke , don't fix it " could applied jak 3 without hesitationthe voice acting one area that kept fairly high quality throughout series , legacy kept up here . where story falters , voice actors often revive it , vice versa ... it good collaboration . scenes routinely stolen daxter / or villains , who go above beyond their pursuit good reading matches circumstances , while jak kept fairly low-key stoic . it best , too , because few occasions where he decide go all macho tries spit out line like " let go kill us some metal heads , " it doesn't fit he comes across awkward unsure . upon completing second game , i likened it empire strikes back , it took fairly light-hearted series transformed it into more adult-oriented saga , incredible results . what it worth , star wars parallel carries over fairly accurately this third chapter - you'll get lots warm fuzzies end , it not quite weighty or substantial second chapter , but overall it still very entertaining experience cast characters you can't help but love . big action scenes really fabulously , there rarely dull moment , but this game suffers unbelievable quality game immediately preceded it	-1
i'm so glad i listened fine reviewers amazon bought this game ... it worth every penny then some !! it lot really great game play i love how babies used conjunction adults accomplish various tasks . i feel like game play also very natural characters ... you wouldn't feel right mario luigi casting spells like characters final fantasy , but it perfect them jumping smashing hammers flinging turtle shells . weird sounds , it makes great rpg . lots good side-missions too , like collecting beans . wonderful game !	1
nfs most wanted ok , but there few things i don't like it . variety cars mediocre , controls horrible . how you eliminate old fashioned way control using pad ? i absolutely hated . amount vehicles horrible ... only 37 . nfs hot pursuit 2 , there close 50 . i am not thrilled tuning feature , what deal nos ? way i see it , if you need nos your car , then your car isn't fast enough . i like police ai , that just incredible , 3d models vehicles incredible . gameplay great combining elements hot pursuit 2 , underground , underground 2 helps game , but variety cars hinders it	-1

castlevania series games involving vampires side scrolling combat . dawn sorrows , soma cruz teenager who soul dracula within him . year ago ( game before this one ) he fight off dark powers within him . he won thought his life would normal again . unfortunately , when this game opens , he immediately comes under attack vanquish new set foes . game pixel based side-scroller involves human figures fighting skeletons , werewolves , other monsters . look definitely old school / retro . if example you ran this side side against robots , title i reviewed recently , robots figures crisp detailed , while castlevania characters screens showed granularity . it style difference many people appreciate . you primarily move left right , slashing your sword , throwing bones , performing other styles attacks take out your enemies . there some platforming well , jumping up down ladders get new areas . this works well storyline , so it not like , say , mario where platforming all there game . example , there ' hunter ' who sworn kill dracula . soma knows hunter , understands hunter fight him if he loses control himself dracula . they enemies who truce , who both respect each other , but who know if circumstances change they lock comba t.t here some touch screen aspects game . you find ' seals ' which essence patterns lines . perform certain actions - example finish off boss - you create this seal . this involves drawing pattern perfectly . you're allowed practice , but when time comes , if you don't get seal just right , you could great trouble . it neat idea , but i wish it something little less " perfectionist " oriented . i know many people who just can't draw well or who hands shake bit . if they'd gone memorization game - or logic puzzle or something - it would more real skill / intelligence less " perfectly steady hands " . general i like fun action , i appreciate rpg storyline here . i got drawn into story rather quickly . i think next version i would like see graphics kicked up match ds capabilities , ' seal ' puzzle changed less perfectionist drawing , i'd also like some dialogue less cliche . i loved ' flow ' plot but winced several comments made characters . well recommended	-1

when i think entire series such final fantasy , this game always seems odd one out . ffviii not take medieval or archaic look others series . i hardly agree gamers who not see potential this game . ff8 takes lot unique elements more noticeable than other ff games . one elements very unusual storyline . my opinion , storyline rather impressive . though it overshadows blossoming love 2 main characters , there not lot predictability storyline . no hidden characters no actual villain remains same throughout game . element gameplay . characters able draw distribute elements little more refreshing use than materia junction systems previous ffs . graphics final fantasy 8 very exquisite . cutscenes enough illustrate game without drawing away gameplay . i especially enjoy soundtrack game . i mix all video game music my ipod often am confused which game it comes . ff8 distinguished composition makes it stand out other video games . lot gamers know , ff8 takes series direction other games not take . lack mini-games definitely issue . while triple triad fun addictive take , it hassle reload or restart game if you lose valuable cards . also , trading some these valuable cards items hassle too . i found myself desperate need invincibles use defense against final boss . guardian forces ( almost forgot them ) exciting acquire too . spending numerous time sidequests should not requirement beat game though . also , ff8 spends little interest developing secondary characters but i praise excellence overall dialogue writing . give ff8 shot favor yourself gamers who feel like it definite miss	-1
while i not spend retail this headset(i got it xbox several other things ebay ) , i buy communicator(which found gamestop.com ) it still worth money . it blocks out background noises so people you talking wont hear other people household talking or guests you you talking you . while it not worth $50 , if you get it part deal something else , all means it . note : i said this before my review but communicator found gamestop.com or amazon if you type : xbox live communicato	-1

this game enjoyable enough , but doesn't really hold my interest enough go back it . it lags bit my gamer pc , some minor errors , but all aside , it just wasn't interesting me . game good quality , may perfect other gamers , so it still worth good rating	-1
great stoey , feels like you old west , but grafics bit slow . all all great game	-1
first glance average person might assume appeal grand theft auto graphic violence , swearing mature content but truth gta series revolutionary technological achievement remains one most impressive experiences you find gaming . first time i ever tried gta : liberty city i absolutely blown away size scope fully realized , living city . it same feeling i got first time i played mario 64 i recognized i witnessing major leap forward . now almost 10 years later rockstar treated us their latest effort , gta : san andreas . liberty city prototypical big east coast city while vice city combination vegas southern florida . san andreas takes gamers west coast shades san francisco , la points . always city gigantic fully realized way true crime series could only dream . fact i noticed billboard san andreas mocking true crime . gta always freedom ; freedom walk , drive or bicycle wherever you want , freedom walk up pop someone mouth if you want . sure it violent but consider it wish fulfillment those us inner anarchist who desires expression without messiness accountability . only other game even approached gta scale mafia but mafia saddled unforgiving law enforcement wouldn't even allow players run red lights . unfortunately , not everything sunshine palm trees san andreas . vehicles extremely difficult control . problem vehicle movement camera angle work independently which means when you make turn using keyboard you quickly swing camera around using mouse realign yourself . even after considerable practice i still found it very challenging awkward . shooting likewise rather challenging perform i just don't remember it this hard two previous games . other surprise how taxing game my pc . i played first two gta significantly weaker machine surprised i couldn't max out all settings san andreas . i pull drawing distance significantly keep frame rate up while using p4 3.0 ghz 1 gig memory ati radeon x600 graphics card . i knock one star off because awkward controls but gta one those games you could spend month never get board . just exploring city worth price admission .	-1
only faults i find this otherwise great game horribly long load times how long it takes get decent car race . game very addictive , especially when it comes tuning your hard-won new car . customization your car extremely detailed almost fun racing . computer cars give you real challenge certain types races , but you change difficulty level if you find it little too hard first . scenery gorgeous ! able drive anywhere you want really fun too . i actually prefer this game over ea newer release : most wanted . i would recommend this game , but patience needed your first few hours gameplay	1
graphics : 7/10 . well , we talking ps1 port . so don't expect much here . but new cgs nice , even old ps1 sprites actually pretty nicely animated . super/special moves ( pws ) rather nice , too . sound : 6/10 . dialoguing very annoying first . it very much apparent moment you start up game , when you go through prologue . once you get used it , it not bad . sound effects seem bit primitive too , but again , this rather old game . btw , fans quickly note , game uses same voice actors pokemon . :d gameplay : 7/10it interesting mix platforming , puzzles , turn based real time combat . personally , i not enjoy platforming part . genera never my favorite , psp diagonal insensitivity makes some jumps pain . combat rather fun original . but after mid game , your characters so over-leveled over-equipped , almost all battles except few boss battles become trivial . replay : 8/10there lot here . chances , your first game , you've missed out " " ending , true ending . standard " " ending pretty mundane . there quite few characters game , you probably not get explore all them until you replay game . personally , i'm story driven player , so once i know plot , i little interest replaying game , but i think many players don't mind going through story again- such players , replay value should fairly high . story : 9/10a most excellent story . many characters you come across rather poignant stories , you learn each them , small reflections your main character . plot weaved very nicely , although it somewhat slow beginning . my only negative that keeping this 10/10 , very last scene- it somewhat left me unfulfilled . but i hear that matter opinion	-1
nancy drew : last train blue moon canyon ( 13)-before i begin ... my review spilt up into sections in-depth look topic . if you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't patience i would not continue reading , but if you want learn most product before you buy it you'll continue . -gameplay interfacethis point-and-click mystery , arrows hands simple easy use . they also made improvement arrows since last game . hands manipulate items or add them your inventory(toolbox ) . when playing game you also panel bottom screen including : inventory(depicted toolbox , which i think should backpack instead ) camera cell phone journal , help menu button ( other games coin purse when money used game ) . main menu pretty simple . however , loading saving game little clunky you can't delete saved games . it also prompts you your decision ; it makes saving/rewriting games take more than one click . this type game interface perfect , but i'll knock off star irritating save/load page . ****-plota fairly used plot this series , finding treasure . but her interactive made this treasure finding story little more interesting . jake hurly , miner owner custom-built train , falls love young french woman named camille way finding gold . camille later dies , jake possibly finds treasure but he nowhere found his now " haunted " train found out out nevada desert engineer dead . many years later , lori girard ( daddy little fame seeking , rich girl ) finds train puts it back into shape trip copper gorge , colorado . she invites infamous guests train find out what happened jake hurley where his mine using clues jake left train . pretty simple treasure story ( this series often uses story but different ways ) now turned into intriguing mystery , good work her interactive . game also some side mysteries like lori getting kidnapped someone throwing emergency brake(both happen publicity stunts ) . but you find who those things only minutes after each event happened . what i didn't like there not really culprit because there no crime committed . very end when crime attempted after you find out who culprit . jake hurley part plot fantastic but sub-plot(s ) weren't very exciting . ****-charactersi loved characters , but you couldn't really interact them much . lori girard one my favorite characters , i loved watching dumb blonde trying get publicity how she always kept forgetting nancy name . since lori hostess she probably main character . tino baldcucci great character well . he private investigator but all he really get such fame right place right time . he conceited lori , you'll probably interact him lot more than john grey . john grey first black male this series , he host ghost hunters , cable show verge cancellation ghosts . he pretty good character but not leading role unfortunately . then there charleena purcell romance novelist introduced nancy drew : secret shadow ranch ( 10 ) , who nice very smart . she process making her book that deadline , who you'll find out used one lori story ideas her latest book without permission . i like her better now then when she nd 10 , bad she no memory game . finally there frank joe hardy . these teenage brothers work american teens against crime ( atac ) who invited because their dad friends lori dad . boys nice enough invite nancy well . i personally liked this addition game because you get play frank short-order cook . they really don't much case , they just good source info . i am looking forward playing them more nancy drew : creature kapu cave ( 15 ) . i really didn't like how there not lot character interaction this game . but when you interact times it really fun . that something add nd 16 beyond . ****-setting graphicsi love train , feel so exciting . seeing scenery pass windows great . cars so detailed beautiful . i think my favorite place train projection car . later you stop copper gorge , little town colorado . there mysterious crypt museum/taffy shop cheesy but enjoyable . crypt small there wasn't much , but i mean real life all you crypts mourn . graphics great . very realistic . its amazing how much graphics this series keeps getting better better . this probably most unique setting series . i personally love trains , boats planes so this made me really happy . *****-puzzles/activitiesthe puzzles fairly easy . i liked how lot puzzles combined into one find where jake mine . what disappointing repetition puzzles . there four or five pipe sets you connect which got little annoying . you also retrieve lot items like gemstones , tools , duct tape , pen other stuff . i don't understand how they made finding gemstones easier than playing almost impossible game tino get simple pen . some puzzles unique , like camille doll sorting puzzle her favorite dance step , playing " camptown races " piano , using metal slugs mathematical way open doors scale . but some these activities needed no skill all like combinations , word search , two memory games . this game variety but also repeated some puzzles well which brought down its score . ***-endingonce you find out where jake mine your sent off there get head start " treasure " . you'd think after all puzzles you went through you would think finding treasure mine would somewhat harder than everything else . you open entrance , memorize couple things , follow some lizards then use info you memorized . not difficult if you smart . then you find " treasure " your so called " culprit " . you wouldn't know this person culprit when he/she finds you mine talks you , but then he/she loses trust you you get caved . then you get out(i thought this fun , felt like roller coaster ) stop " culprit " . i liked ending what treasure but getting through out mine relatively easy . although culprit kind obvious , i liked what culprit plan or goal . overall it good ending yet little easier than i thought it should . ****-overallthis one better nancy drew games out there . definitely one add your shelf . flaws this game don't affect game much they could if setting different . plot pretty good most puzzles fit into it . i enjoyed this game lot after i played it more than two times . i think any game needs played more than two times get full experience . some parts game really exciting compared other parts . repetition some puzzles isn't too bad . this game outstanding but there never going best nancy drew game . it really depends your opinion . add all these up divide 6 ... 4 *' ( gameplay interface)4 *' ( plot)4 *' ( characters)5 *' ( setting graphics)3 *' ( puzzles)4 *' ( ending) = 24 stars divide 6 ( categories ) = 4 starsthanks reading	-1

im quite sure your mom probally her eye ds , especially release ds lite games like brain age your mother would want . but i am also sure your mom may not like white color , well that good , becausse coral pink ds make it more fashionable girls , well maybe even attract few guys well ( no , i am not gay , steorotypical or homophobic ) . i say people who first bashed ds , this what you get talking crap . it might astonishing sony getting their butts kicked , after all , ps2 destroyed gamecube terms sales ( same thing ps n64 ) , but some people just don't get psp . that fine , but i like my psp better , basically because my favorite genre racing . ds dosen't lumines or gta . or locoroco , so so . but then again , ds mario , magnetica , whatever . it all depends what you like best most , but since i am no fanboy or like videogames all far reaches galaxy , i enjoy each every system . now system . you know you not want bored tedious details how everythng better all other stuff you basically don't need , but this system ideal even people who original ds . if you like ds , this system update actuallly worth it . stylus way bigger , it certainly looks better , it easier play , better design , better system general . sure , you could say you don't need it , but that fine . although some people ( especially nintedno fans ) , they just can't live without it would definitly take it . myself included , i got one very soon , also , i give props nintendo making sure enough there go around everybody . i white one , but it still same great system , although you would probally choose which color you want . short , don't feel guilty if you shell out 100 bucks , it really worth it . if you don't it , it worth it , you get all kinds cool stuff this fall , includes web browser . so far though , europe gett ing it before us	1
