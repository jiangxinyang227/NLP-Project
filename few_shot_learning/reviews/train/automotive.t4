i bought 3 sets these blades my cars . they lasted 2 weeks ( most ) average summer . bosch or anco blades usually work 2 years . it up you decide which blades buy ! follow-up : i see some people find my review not helpful , you know what : i tried warn you . obviously you either too much money or you're stockholders rainx . my advice you : buy garbage , support economy	-1
i pretty dirty car i used mr. clean starter kit . i followed all directions . i also washed my car shade , i rinsed soaped car portions one reviewer mentioned . i waited 30mins or more car dry only parts really clean shiny windows . it still left lot dirt my car , despite all scrubbing i during soaping step . it even took more water than what i would used washing it old fashion way . i looked faq sheet came kit it said if you see streaks it may dirt , all you go through steps again get rid it . it just hassle . least i wash my house windows it until filter get used up . otherwise it waste money	-1

this product purchased christmas gift my father , unfortunately it not perform him . i replacing this one he over 10 years one still works outperfomed this brand new model . i am not sure if we just got defective one but i dont recommend purchasing although i say returning amazon straightforward they just simply refunded my money , i inturn buy my dad something else amazon you just cant beat service	-1
it appears problem slow readings described earlier reviews solved , my gauge reads continuously . reading drops several psi while bleeding just mechanical dial gauge . reading takes two seconds re-stabilize , so mechanical gauge actually faster use . quick-connector end hose excellent , but careful not scratch wheel it . hose fairly stiff , but isn't problem most time . i used this gauge track this past weekend , pleased it until second morning when it cold ( cold i mean 45f , this houston ... ) display read ' lo ' , indicating low battery . so essentially gauge useless . hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold . overall , good mechanical gauge easier use more reliable , long you don't drop it	-1
dimensions confusing/inaccurate . stated height 11.5 inches not correct -- perhaps this shipping container . actual product 8.5 inches high , but taking into account cradle tire , only raises vehicle 6 inches	-1
i got this item my coffee-loving truck driver husband . when we took it out box , we saw obvious problem : " mug " tiny ! only bit larger than espresso cup . add insult injury , it took way too long brew such small cup . now it back box collecting dust we're sorry we wasted our hard-earned money	-1

i so excited this bag but it huge disappointment . description clearly indicates waterproof , but fact it mostly water resistant , 8 scale 1-10 according box . since our travel coincided several rain storms , this very important differentiation ! straps ' net ' extremely unmanageable there several key elements missing instructions . never used roof top cargo bag before , this presented quite obstacle me . there loops through which you send straps net holds bag down , instructions make no mention them , you loop strap through before or after you loop it through luggage rack ? it make difference ? it took me 45 minutes just get thing attached my roof due trial error ( not counting loading time ) . clips themselves very poor construction , one them broke upon tightening makeshift tied instead . straps also not tighten very easily , you feed straps through clips then keep moving clips back forth until you get it length you wan t.t he stitching also started ripping when trying close very stubborn zipper . bag not overstuffed . i cannot recommend this product	-1
" advanced security " all lie . these locks easily opened without key . i written masterlock company they replaced lock free charge one uses regular key	-1

appears good product one major exception . you can't even charge it first use without getting extension cord plug into 110v power . required cord must only one plug where most cords today come plug end let you plug more than one item . blades jump starter resessed so extension cord must only one place plug anything or fitting big go into recess . got this present so far report old type cord hard find . i find it unbelievable any company producing this item would not include 4 feet cheap cord so product could put service once	-1
description this product not accurate . these lights not bright . i 6 mounted under cabinets my very small kitchen all 6 once add up equivalent night light . it pretty color light , but very dim	-1
i unsure this company so i only popped week subscription , felt gamble $10 worth it . well not all gambles work out , this one not . when you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you , now one might think once you this information you want access your particular vehicle , not so . i want know how replace certain part , well you go part look it up , it tells you replacement procedure car not even yours , nothing your car , uh !! c'mon . there very little trobleshooting , no flow charts troubleshooting . save you money buy haynes manual your vehicle , you'll much farther ahead .	-1
we purchased this rooftop cargo carrier transport our suitcases beach items during our summer vacation new england . we initially concerned because it so inexpensive size worried it might not fit trailblazer . upon arrival we pleased find it not only fit securely , but rather stylish too . although it appeared weatherproof we soon found it not . it began raining onset our trip . four hours our fourteen hour roadtrip weatherproof lining began disintingrating . time we arrived our destination all our possessions soaked coated tiny grey vinyl flecks . this cargo hauler might cheap look nice , but it not worth your money	-1

i bit skeptical buying this product because other products i tried claimed spot-free failed miserably . i pleasantly surprised mr. clean autodry system ! if you follow directions put bit effort into your wash job it works very , very good ! - you first rinse off your vehicle regular , unfiltered water either through autodry gun or your regular hose sprayer . - next , you use autodry " soap " setting completely cover vehicle . they advise only use mr. clean soap , course , because it contains agents not normally found other car washing soap assists sheeting action ( similar jet dry dishwasher)- thirdly , you give vehicle old fashioned hand wash sponge . make sure you good job clean it completely or you find streaks when it dries old dirty water smeared all over . - fourth , rinse vehicle completely unfiltered water . make sure you very through this stage . take your time ! - finally , set autodry filtered rinse setting go over vehicle again . make sure you start vehicle highest point remove all tap water sitting roof . basically , you want filtered water remove all unfiltered water . spray filtered water all crevices avoid spots later ( side view mirrors , bumpers , etc . ) although it sounds like it takes long time it really quite quick if you put some effort into it . i complete vehicle ( ford explorer ) start finish 15 minutes . car dries completely spot free every time ! course , results only good you make them . if you don't wash completely or rinse unfiltered water off completely there spots . it up you through job get great results	1

i've never used any other type oil filter wrench or strap but this tool worked me when i couldn't twist off oil filter hand . it uses 3/8 " drive but it doesn't " snap " onto wrench so it fall off easily . long you careful , you shouldn't problem it save you lot time when changing your oil filter . prongs adjusted holding onto " base " turning socket wrench . prongs rotate around base depending direction you turn . way it works widest position , turning either direction cause prongs " close " certain direction . way , long you prongs closing proper direction , when you trying remove oil filter , it grip harder you turn counter-clockwise . if you prongs closing wrong direction , then turning counter-clockwise actually widen prongs	1

jan . 21 update : i got low-battery indication while using gauge , it turns out lr1130 batteries alkaline , not lithium both product packaging instructions say they . batteries indeed very easily replaced , i'm replacing them silver oxide equivalent ( sr1130w ) , original batteries apparently weren't freshest ( although they hitachi-maxell ) . i continue like this gauge very much . i think this great product great price ( currently $35 total ) , i just bought 2nd one lend so others see themselves ( don't want without mine case it doesn't come back ) . very simple connect take reading , when bleeding air numbers drop drop air pressure , so i reach exact pressure i want quickly . batteries user replaceable , but they lithium ( lr1130 ) expected last more than several years ( packaging suggests they last life gauge , " permanent power " ) . gauge zeroed ( recalibrated ) simply turning it without any air pressure hose , confirming display reads " 0.0 , " waiting until display goes off ( 20 sec . when no pressure present 60 sec . when there pressure present ) . while gauge display reads tenth pound , actual stated accuracy instructions plus or minus 1 percent plus 0.5 psi , which suggests real accuracy within 0.2 0.8 pound , which still better than any other gauge i've seen or used . instructions explain things well enough ( they read though they translated into english , but still completely understandable ) , listed web site actual manufacturer , measurement ltd ., inc . ( new jersey ) , provides contact info . user inquiries . i like using this gauge ( it quick easy ) , makes maintaining my tire pressure proper level simple consistently ( good portable air compressor , like typhoonmax tx-500 , which i also really like ) .	1

i am car fanatic used one these dusters my cars last decade or more . long surface dry , it works wonderfully . once some contaminants start build paint , use duster , then some quick detail microfiber cloth get paint really clean . my cars always look new these things . i just traded my 2004 rx-8 after 2.5 years using duster , it still looked absolutely new . i now use it my 2006 lancer evolution , again , car looks brand-new ( which it ) . i love them	1
i first got one these gift back late ' 80s when i bought my first new car . it worked exactly advertised intervening years , i replaced it only two or three times ... it actually work better once it gets dirtier - i absolutely attest this i got new one year ago , older one worked better first ... after couple weeks ( i dust car four times day ) , it started work well older one . i took old one tried washing it hand cold ater woolite , recommended makers website , it definitely cleaner still worked just well . if you love your car even half much i , this product worth every cent	1
it simple device , it easy imagine enhancements would improve it , yet it advertised just what i wanted it . it sits shallow cardboard box seats my old nissan where it perfectly level not shift around while i'm driving , so i set it up just before i leave work . i work close my home , so my morning commute ten minutes , time it takes wagan brew my coffee . larger cup brew-through lid would make it safer use while car motion , which manufacturer recommends against , still i am very happy it no complaints .	1

its great product it coats when it rains when you just put it you dont even need use wipers but it take some work make sure its not smeared looking . clean your glass good windex first then apply polish off . i dont really buy any those seen tv items but this first one really works well also if you side windows squeak this help well since slippery it help weather stripping . remember this works best when over 40mph ... you keep reapplying few times yea	1

i bought this tire gauge specifically check tire pressure my f350 dually . factory installed steel extenders made using pencil type gauges or other digital gauges impractical , particularly checking inner outer rear tires . even though this gauge sold ' dual rear wheel trucks ' , i bend steel tube 5 degrees so it could make solid contact inner tire inflation stem . once it bent , gauge worked perfectly ! note : i friends machine shop bend steel tube me , it too stiff bend hand or vice . gauge big digits easy read , even without my cheater glasses . air release button handle convienent use - even though i first thought it display . i found it best test pressure , add more air than needed then slowly release it using combination button disengaging reengaging gauge testing until you get desired tire pressure . i found if i failed disengage then reengage tire pressure gauge , it tended give me same reading without resetting . guys garages always ' ohhhh ahhhh ' when i open case pull out this impressive tool . it well worth money amazon best price various sites i visited while price shopping . oh , yea , i cut plastic case tad allow bent tube properly fit case so it would close	1
goes easy , wipes off super , amazinglyl easy , gives very nice finish . i'll wait few months see how long it lasts , but application pleasant experience . one thing - they said it doesn't get black trim white , but it looks like it - white starting show 2 weeks after i applied it . it possible it my previous wax , but i don't think so since i covered mother back-to-black product .	1

i read evacuators few forums - it works described . no complaints other than amount time it took draw 8 quarts . said , perhaps first use included bit learning curve . fill/drain capability looked appealing , but if you don't need use this device fill fluids , i would opt drain-only device - less moving parts , fewer things fail	1
works well . it operates bit slowly but i assume they all . this not problem would not prevent me purchasing it again . significant advantage this unit fluid evacuated unit w/o " pour " it out . others require opening resevoir pouring fluid out . this useful when dealing w/ motor oil or other fluids messy . i am satisfied would purchase it again .	1

most people agree u-locks one best ways locking up your bicycle . i agree assessment , provided there something strong which affix lock . whatever you lock your bike , it right height right shape order accessible u-lock . i seen many bicyclists dc area use their $100 u-lock secure their $3000 bicycle things like street signs , wrought-iron fences , rusty pipes , even wooden park benches . street sign poles , which usually line holes running down them , designed give break away when hit automobiles . thief could easily bend break street sign pole get your bike . i recently heard friend their bike stolen because thief merely pulled loose pole its decaying cement base . coworker bike stolen when thief lifted bike off top pole after removing bolted-on street sign . wrought iron fences easily broken kicked or leveraged welding points . rusty pipes , well , need i say more ? point , bike racks aren't always where you need them , you can't always find something right size use your u-lock . two job sites i ride my work , only things i lock my bicycle gigantic street light poles . new york chain only truly secure way lock up my beloved bicycle . versatility chain best part this locking system . when i use bike racks , i just either wrap chain few times around bike or racks , or i fix lock links closer together chain - easily accomplished if you pull black sleeve back . now only complaint i new york chain : it heavy . really heavy . first ride i took new york chain , i just threw it my messenger bag strapped bag diagonally across my chest . weight so lopsided i felt myself leaning away bag just improve my balance while riding . first time ever , i used twin shoulder straps until then tucked into their pocket messenger bag . even then , weight enough leave red chafe marks my shoulders evening after my ride home . maybe younger riders handle weight , but i'm little further age it bit much . if your waist skinny enough , you wear it your waist like belt . i tried it way if you put lock back or your non-dominant side it isn't all bad . but my bicycle touring experience tells me this one those items you should really carry bike if all possible . i don't recommend handlebars - makes steering sluggish . top tube okay , but lock nasty habit swinging into your knees you pedal . eventually i start carrying laptop computer around work , so i got luggage rack panniers . throwing chain panniers definitely easiest option . when you're not carrying anything else panniers , trunk bag even better place it - weight higher bike , yes , but it centered . overall , i like this lock its versatility locking options , allowing me lock my bicycle anything large immovable . i think this best way get highest level kryptonite security . however , if bike racks more abundant my area , i would gladly give up extra weight getting standard u-lock	1

we needed way haul three adult-sized bicycles our home base various cycling paths . so i visited number local stores see what my options . i settled yakima bighorn 4 best option my budget , then discovered through some online searching i could purchase next model up , yakima kingpin 4 bike rack bit less than bighorn 4 would run me traditional retailer . kingpin 4 folds features fold-down mast , must convenience allow access vehicle rear hatch or door . although i would not consider bike rack without this feature , forewarned : once you lower rack while it loaded three bikes ( more fourth bike claim follows ) , you hard pressed single-handedly reposition it slide lock or bolt . there too much weight pivot point . i soon learned , therefore , it easier mast folded up , not down , when loading bikes . dual bike arms must , allowing more stability easier loading unloading . bike arms fold down well , though this option , while useful , not essential many cases . ( these folding bike arms main difference kingpin bighorn racks . ) series bike cradles rubber " chainstraps " stabilize anchor bikes . you slide theses cradles tubular arms allow sufficient room avoid any rubbing or scraping if you carrying three bikes . ( i looked some less expensive racks required hand-tightening one or more big bolts tighten clamps held bikes . system seemed like royal pain huge annoyance . ) despite name billing , i'm less confident recommending kingpin4 transporting four bikes . i think it possible , but would require great care avoid scraping paint or entangling pedals spokes . plus , i prefer using four " chainstraps " per bike bit insurance , so if you want carry four bikes , i would recommend springing set these . unloaded contraption weights 32 pounds , so it not too heavy you carry it basement or garage install it . but careful arms or you might shatter glass door or outside light . also , you need bit assembly out box , so allow good 30 minutes set up test rig before using it first time . drawings instructions not seem match what i actually looking when i everything before me floor , so i spent extra few minutes considering options . this assembly not difficult---it just adage " never anything first time " may stump one bit . i am using this rack two-inch hitch , i purchased locking pin replace bolt shipped attaching rack hitch . i also run one cable bike locks through bike frames around spanner arms add measure security . during our first foray , 100-mile trip each way , bikes rack swayed just bit time time , but overall , sway not problem . hundred extra pounds jutting up behind rear window change any vehicle handling hamper visibility through rearview mirror , so prepared change your driving style needed . conclude , kingpin 4 performed well . we could load unload three bikes five minutes , neither durango or bikes scratched during transport . but , again , i would suggest this rack great three bikes , but may challenge carrying four .	1
i love my tink visor . it matches my tink seat covers floor mats . i wish it held more cd though , but it holds typical amount visor ( 10 cd ) . i'm very happy this purchase	1

ok , this item . looking easy in-expensive parking system : this it . well , i own ferrari ' two ' car garage . nothing comes 3 ' my-precious ..... but , parking this beauty what now become space shuttle simulation area , requires precise skills , course which i ... goes without saying . looked in-floor bumpa systems but required sticky tape cleaning it wasn't good . desired electronic stuff but hated thought electricity such cost some too high justify : enter this item which pure spot-on . it uses power , get this , your garage door light . there light activated switch triggers laser fire blinking fashion . very compact , very easy install , very small [ laser 1.5 " long . solar powering laser works like charm , trigger works perfectly no power sources worry . if it doesn't work it means you didn't open door [ separate problem ] or garage light out [ separate problem ] . this device hot after several months , still attached , works like charm : get this one	1
using mr clean autodry system while now . long filter refill not used up ( stops deionizing water ) , you'll get nice sheeting effect when you rinse vehicle off , allowing it dry spot-free . thing you remember this isn't pressure washer , or anything other than system . you wet vehicle , wash system soap , then rinse normal water . when you're ready dry , use filtered water , then let dry ! best if you wash your vehicle shaded area , or soap/rinse water dry leaving spots . only negative i it it doesn't last very long when you've got full-size truck minivan needs washing . after 2-3 washes my vehicles ( total , not each ! ) filter doesn't deionize well . but sure make drying much easier these big vehicles ! no more hand drying me	1

i finally upgrade my old faithful 35-year-old schumacher 6 amp charger - not because it quit working , but because it didn't enough horsepower handle big 105 ampere-hour trolling motor battery my boat . i wanted higher capacity unit , but same solidly built reliability i've experienced my old shumacher charger . this unit priced quite bit less than some other brands similar capability , so i little afraid schumacher , like many companies , might gone " cheap " route their products using lightweight case cheap components . not so ! i pleasantly surprised find this solid , heavy , well built charger best schumacher tradition . well designed very stout plastic cabinet pop-up carrying handle , informative easy use front panel controls , nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget unplug it first , plus automatic polarity protection , looong power cord handy place store cord . i found only single minor negative : if i change anything this unit , i'd find quieter fan . fan , although it pretty loud it size , least automatic only runs when needed , so this no big deal me , since i only run it my shop/garage . haven't tried " start " function , which i consider more or less useless frill charger this size , but it certainly charges all types batteries like champ , automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great . i highly recommend this great little charger	1

all i say wow ... just ... wow . i wanted some good replacement windshield wiper blades bosch blades i ( they year half old weren't holding out well ) . i my research decided look into silicon rubber blades after reading so much them . i first going get piaa brand , however price five year warranty silblades offered changed my mind . i haven't looked back since . one things i hated my old blades they ended up making lot noise when sliding against windshield unless there decent amount water pouring down . first day i installed these onto my car first rain drizzle came down i sold . blades whisper quiet , even just little moisture glass . you literally won't hear them . heck , they quiet even if you no water glass . all you hear motors turn blades . my old bosche blades weren't anywhere near quiet , even right out box . silblades seem work really well getting water off windshield too . i dare say better than any other blades i used . some other blades i would sometimes leave thin trail water still glass , but not silblades . everything wipes clean blade path . also it true what they say silicone rubber leaving protective coating . rain your windshield start bead just like after waxing your car . i can't say it happened immediately because ... well my windshield waxed day before i installed blades . however beading lasting much , much longer than it should waxing alone . i live houston , tx so i'm love how these blades hold up against searing heat . no cracks yet or even color fading . i can't tell you how well they snow ice since we don't get much either here , i haven't travelled anywhere test blades yet . however i don't doubt manufacturer claims standing up bitter cold . piaa silicone blades claimed they could all these things too . however they $25 per blade only guaranteed work year . silblades five year warranty price can't beat . if you really , really want noticeable difference our windshield wiping experience then i suggest you grab these your own vehicle . you thank me it .	1
this first clay bar system i used , it still best . you absolutely need use this before you wax , or else you're just waxing those impurities into your finish , creating more annoying swirl marks . doing this step before you wax bit more work , but it worth it . i could live without mother wax they include kit , i don't use it . but i always use this before i wax my car . glass-like feeling your paint gets amazing	1
