worst product ever ! safety 1st should recall this item if they any sense all . i'd like smack so called engineer designed this infant tub . my 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him blood blister . yeah , ouch !!! stinkin bar goes legs slides out place when baby moves -- snap ! it pinches their private part . everything just fine then suddenly my son looked me such panic then screamed cried . i realize what happened quickly moved bar . ouch ! it still makes me grit my teeth when i think it . horrible product especially baby boys .	-1
i am just writing say i loved this tub until my baby 2 months , 26 inches tall her head hanging over edge we could no longer easily shampoo rinse without getting water everywhere . also , edge rounded so any water splashed it goes right out ... wet mommy daddy ! so it great until she reached 10 lbs could not use hammock anymore maybe we'll use it when she sit up , but i'm thinking we'll just use big tub when she sit up !	-1
i don not like these washes all . scent very very overpowering !!!!! i mix only little one unscented brand it still too strong . i love case though . it sturdy lots room	-1
this monitor only great if your house smaller than our tokyo apartment . although monitor sensitive clear , moving receiver any more than 15 feet away transmitter results intermittent loud beeps indicating loss signal	-1
we bought this when our baby born ( 6 months ago , only used it few times until recently ) . he loves it now get him sleep . problem lies 4 am , my husband i awake hear mobile playing ... scares us death since no one else should around start it . we go into nursery our child holding it playing animals .... clip holds umbrella part broken off , causing mobile fall baby . ( he thought it funniest thing world , he okay , thank god . ) but little plastic hook piece his hand . if you 6-month old child you know they eat everything they find . i thank god he didnt put his mouth . it great soother baby , but sure there no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it great .	-1
this product not safe product should not used your child . not only it give additional padding not intended , nor tested your safety seat , but it also voids warranty safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) government agency sets standards child safety seats states " after-market products " should not used . it also not meet fmvss213 standards stated manufacturer description	-1
i love this swing because it goes side side , she sit when awake , lay down when asleep , once you put her she out cold . after 6 weeks using it i thought battery going , but when i changed battery music still slow i still keep swinging motion high , two weeks later it just stopped working . i've only it two months hardly use it , just total 3 hours day give or take few	-1
i'm not certain why there so many glowing reviews this product . my wife registered this item because 4 stage tub looked good theory . unfortunately , because collapsible design this " bath " tub not hold water , it just runs out seam where two sides come together . there foam gasket around seam intended hold water , but it useless . sling useful bathing infant , removable ring it job keeping infant upright while learning sit . unfortunately , time our infant ready sit we already replaced this piece junk . i guess they call it safety 1st your kid can't drown dry bath tub	-1
we ordered one , it didn't work well . it seemed great , but it bear fold when there little bit wind . based all reviews , we thought we must defective one . we ordered replacement , but it seems same issues . very disappointed .	-1
this seat great concept , it just doesn't stay together very well . i took it back store they marked it " defective " . few dollars more , i got " healthy care booster seat " fisher price . i've much better luck it	1
this product just doesn't much variety . my baby both completely bored it , only used it handful times . they 5 months 1 year . she like noise makers squishy toys , but these all hard , boring toys ... least my kids	-1
our daughter kept sliding out it wedges wouldn't stay place . i love idea , but it just didn't work us	1
we received this mattress babyshower gift 4 years ago ( i registered babies us ) . my first child used it little over 2 years . my second child used it nearly 2 years . neither child big ( fact , one rather petite ) . even though mattress not abused , it cracked ripped numerous places . i'm currently researching ' lifetime warranty ' policies kolkraft . i don't recommend this mattress .	-1
after concerted effort get this monitor work acceptably , i returned it . this one few products i've truly made me ask , " what they thinking ? " monitor gives off loud " out range " beep whenever it not good communication , there no way shut it off . compound fact it intermittently think it out range even when it just next room , it completely unusable when parents trying sleep . but that least it . voice-activated mic clicks loudly out when it decides transmit , or not . this annoying , but all moreso because when it decides transmit seems absolutely no correlation when there actually sound room . finally , transmission absolutely unintelligible : it marred lot what sounds like digital compression artifacts garble sound -- speech absolutely cannot understood over this monitor . short , no respect this functional product	-1
this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould we thought it smoke detector . we even replaced our smoke detector thinking it broken only find it this stupid monitor . not but this	-1
i got this bra when i pregnant wore it confortable until my delivery . after my delivery bra too small . engorged breast after delivery just carrying mature milk afterwards it just too small . i wasn't told my breast would get even larger after delivery . i thought they big just before delivery . i decided go w/ bravado bra . it worked out much better . it comfortable wear day night . milk comes out it comfortable either way . sizes more flexable then medela . strap support better then medela . i packed up medela bras just use them during pregnancy if i . no use them when i am not pregnant or breastfeeding . breastfeeding their main purpose	1
i seen this product ( others similar it ) . rn , we encouraged prospective parents refrain drawn " cuteness " items geared only sold , not useful . although each category item this kit certainly useful , some essential , it far better spend your money items purchased separately . this way , you check quality longevity . put together your own kit .	1
this item too small . i kept putting it back windshield but it kept falling down each time . i could not see my baby this tiny mirror . not worth money all	1
i bought this puree my 6 month old daughter homemade baby foods . you put blade bottom cup , load food , then put protective plate finally put top piece ( which contains motor ) top . concept seemed good it compact size . cons : 1 ) cup holds less than 1 cup food ... if you go over amount , any liquids food start splatter through make mess , sometimes causes motor stop running ... guess it shorts it out i wait until it dries out before i start again . if you're trying make enough freez cubes food , you'll puree several batches . 2 ) you only run motor short periods time ... up 20 seconds max or something like some foods . this fine soft foods , but if trying puree meats , example , it sometimes takes longer than it becomes hassle grind , wait , grind , wait .... 3 ) motor powers blade way too slow , cooked chicken or beef ends up too lumpy , since you really need faster blade puree them . i've found pureering baby foods , best thing use blender , since blade speed much faster design helps draw foods down bottom so things get more evenly pureed . don't waste your money buying this	-1
looked nice store . thought adjustable head rest nice touch ... until we got home tried use it . head rest not stay stuck down mat , velcro not strong enough . i would not buy this product again	-1
i like music , but we it auto play . because i mirror seat see my son(he still backward facing ) , i can't move seal up farther so he reach part kick make item turn . also , i never able create bubbles like instructions claim . so just music plays . there plenty other smaller items . this thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn't believe . i am changing them every couple days , we aren't car much . what disappointment !! good concept , but doesn't work well all	1
it worked great first time my 14 month old son used it but second time , he figured out how take lid off spilled his cheerios everywhere . i tried it few more times after got same result . lid way too easy remove .	-1
i ordered this item based great rating it got , yet when i received it i unimpressed found size measurements wrong . i ordered medium based manufacturer notes yet when received found i needed longer one . after researching how return , since it came no information this , i found out you not return this product this store . i wanted warn everyone before they purchase .	-1
we bought this bedrail vacation home thought it great first . i realized i didn't like it sticking out so far bed when it folded down , but could live it . second weekend we used it , my 2 year old his cousin , also 2 , climbing into bed stepping bedrail because it stuck out so far , side popped out position , never go back . far i am concerned , this product needs rethought manufacturer . there should some way fix it when it pops out . definitely would not reccommend it . make matters worse , babies us would not return it becuase we no longer reciept	-1
i don't abundance money , but i would definitely pay double if quality sheets better . i don't even want know what thread count these sheets ... what i understand , these only sheets fit thing , so i guess i'm just out luck . hope see alternative these sheets real soon .	-1
doesn't dry your bottles all . it leave condensation doesn't dry completely . i give it one star all stuff it holds , but water leaks out so you put something underneath it .	-1
save your $$ if you plan run this jogging stroller . mild windy day it flips up towards you off side . i didn't think it really shielded my baby sun like i thought it going either . i would not recommend this product . it very cumbersome . when i returned it store , there two others counter behind customer service cashier just returned recently .	-1
we should much more careful read other customers ' negative reviews this crib mattress pad before purchasing three them ( eventually cancelled one ) . we would not recommend this item . after only one wash ( despite followed laundry instruction ) , it shrank so much it became impossible fit our standard crib . when i tried stretch sides around mattress , they tore ..	-1
i bought this item despite review said it too small . big mistake . it small ! it not big enough my 21 months old . i'm very dissapointed because i liked infant version .	-1
i bought this product my 3yr . old . first i thought it would help her go bathroom when we went out but when she sits seat she pinched few times . first she didn't want sit it again amp ; she cried when i took her bathroom , but i told her i would sit her it amp ; i would lift her off . since i doing this she hasn't pinched , but it took me while her trust me . if you buy this product you very careful or your child get pinched	-1
sometimes it works ok . sometimes it stops swinging no reason . sometimes turning mobile instead turn music . it always makes gringing noise when swinging . if it worked like it should it would great product . i like stars projected below- when they work	1
i though it just me but after reading several other reviews i see others agree just how difficult this thing assemble/disassemble . locks impossible , items not quite fit right , it would impossible get this thing into its " travel bag . " mattress thin very lumpy ; each fold this mattress causes hard lumps . i bought this product thinking i could use it portable play yard after my baby out grows co-sleeper aspect but there no way . i recommend you avoid this product !	-1
if you looking make mess , lose milk get frustrated , these bags you . first , these bags no stand up there own it very inconveniant carry little cup around help fill bag . you string twis t-t ie into each bag yourself . also you supposed tear little tab bottom bag get milk out . it not easy . first time i it i lost whole bunch milk . your better off untwisting tie pouring it there . worst thing bag they leaked few times my caregiver warming up milk . this never happened other bags market . my favorite lansinoh . bag thing these medela bags they more expensive than others . pass this try others	-1
i registered received these medela bags . after using all 50 , i got few free lansinoh bags my breast pad purchase . wow !! i never go back medela . reason i registered them because everyone says they strong don't leak . well this only good feature . lansinoh bag strong well , easy close ( double zip-lock vs . medela bothersome twisty ties ) , easy get air out ( unlike medela ) , lansinoh take-up way less room freezer ! stacking medela bags freezer difficult because their shape ... thawing difficult because i see i'll need watch milk doesn't spill out top . lansinoh i won't worry . my medela bags haven't split freezer ... i'll give them . but neither my lansinoh bag .	1
after trying almost every bottle , i tried these waht nightmare ! there many parts clean they leak ! i called dr. brown customer service line they defense said you not shake formula mix it- you stir it . most people who use powder formula know this not option just stiring very slowly they say not mix formula . i saw no difference using these other than they leak pian clean use special brush clean them . i went playtex natural disposables never looked back	-1
i tried fisher-price take-along jungle swing then this open travel swing . both swings my baby would lean forward fold himself half seat . jungle swing difficult haul around since it didn't stay closed well " palm tree " always way . finally i bought fisher-price aquarium swing . i found seat aquarium swing deeper it clicks place ( so it won't fold over baby ) it easier assemble haul around .	-1

this first bottle i purchased my daughter when she born . i breastfeeding but since she jaundice , i suppliment formula first 2 weeks her life ! i worst time this bottle ! it leaked everytime i went shake it whenever i would try feed my daughter she would literaly drown because flow too fast . she would also gag horrible gas ! i stopped formula till she 6 weeks i thought maybe since she older she could take it little better . it ended up same problems again !! i switched playtex nurser those bottles great ! i would recommend them anyone who breast bottle feeding ! my daughter not get confused she not drown formula ! even though it little more work drop system , i dont care ! i push air out bottle she swallows less air she less gas spits up less !	-1
i really disappointed this " sealy ultra " . it not feel like very good mattress . we'll use this couple months replace it something better . i'd say you need see mattress , decide one you want then look best price internet	1
i bought this item preparation my first child . i tried it 8 times me my husband got different reading each time , 94.2 - 102.3 !! i returned it next day , don't bother !	-1
this thermometer not very accurate or consistant . whenever my son sick we used this it would give normal temperature reading i knew it couldn't right . we would take our sons temperature 3 times row never get same reading twice . i even check my own temperature it would come up crazy readings like 95.1 ! we got rid this one because fever-induced seizures run my husbands family we needed something more accurate . it my experience nothing digital gives accurate readings old-fashion oral rectal thermometers work best	-1
i use this work where i infants up toddlers , we repeat process 3 times before we ever get accurate reading . under arm , old traditional thermomaters better	-1
my son 8 months old . he outgrown his infant car seat , now larger seat , but still rear facing . i bought cradler prevent his head slumping forward when he falls asleep seat . it not help this regard all . fact , it just annoys him . i taken it off car seat entirely , i'm not using it all . very disappointed californi	-1

great idea , but very time-consuming put . my advice use regular maya type sling first few months , then get patapum . it least pricey " structured " carriers which only ones put weight your hips , rather than your shoulders , therefore spare your spine .	1
my 11 week old breastfed baby diagnosed mild acid reflux ( she doesn't vomit , it comes up her throat causing crying spells heartburn ) . she also sensitive stomach gassy so we decided try these when she 8 weeks old . they horrible ! we like playtex premium nurser playtex ventaire ( chubby bottles ) much better . we tried regular dr. browns , but she choked nipple so we ordered chubby bottle nipples more like breast . both kinds she sucked too hard ate too fast ... when i sat her up burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce playtex bottles ) , my surprise she already sucked down 3 ounces ! we horrible night both times we tried dr. browns - she cried all night bad tummy ache fast flow ( we used slow flow nipples even ! ) . i also friend same problem her baby choking gagging slow flow nipples ' too-fast-flow ( formula fed baby ) . i highly recommend playtex bottles - they easy clean never leak . we only tried dr. brown see if it would alleviate gerd symptoms - it not !!!!	-1
we all clear swing gate ( hardware-mounted , not pressure-mounted ) installed top our basement stairs . earlier this evening , i opened lock , gate swung out over stairs , top hinge snapped off wall gate tipped away under my hand . fortunately , enough my weight behind me i able correct my balance ( just ! ) not fall headfirst down stairs . but it close thing . inch or pound or second either way i -- or , god forbid , one our children -- would certainly badly injured . while i taking photograph broken hinge , gate itself , which hanging precariously its remaining hinge , fell off tumbled down stairs . gate place six weeks , but only actual use tiny fraction time we out house five those weeks . nb this product failure , not installation fault . screws still firmly attached wall , what remains plastic flanges around appropriate holes hinge . i purchased gate after reading enthusiastic reviews here , but after my experience tonight , i would not recommend anybody buy this gate , ever . ( review gives one star , because no stars not option ) . i would expect see product recall very soon	-1

we bought this monitor year ago replace one we gotten yard sale it seemed work great first , however after 2 months 1st receiver , ( it came two ) , just suddenly stoped working ! i thought maybe one our family members got water it or something because it kept kitchen , but sure enough few months later other receiver we kept our bedroom just suddenly stoped working ! there must some kind defect production these things because i see reading other reviews we're not only family problems . save yourself headache purchase different brand/model	1
same thing happened me person previous review . they sent pink pillow instead crib set , not honor same price bedding set . i send it back they give refund . what hassle	-1
i winter baby i can't begin imagine what i would without this item . i personally inspired 2 other new moms purchase this already well . absolute best thing you never put coat child . what time-saver if you woman on-the-go like myself . i excited right before i my baby girl they came out new limited version . i diva color my little i get lot compliments look ease use . i disagree others who thought it difficult adjust item around harness straps it cheaply made . i installed sack made adjustment one-time . material allows weather some liquids just roll right off fabric . i would consider this must any firs t-t ime moms ( i ) their registry . price definitely lot higher than i would like see it , but still must if you afford make purchase .	-1
i three kids , third time , i am utterly dissapointed avent product . each new child , we bought fresh supply bottles , hoping avent fixed this problem . we really wanted these bottles work , they seem most durable stylish ones market , our kids never any problems nipples . however , each time , we ended up switch brand . leak not just spot here or there . it often torrential downpour , leaking out sides white cap . i know many people who same problem . expensive these bottles , i would think avent would take more pride their product , fixing such simple things leak . don't waste your money	-1
my seat brand new i love it , but it already quick working . i've changed batteries reapeatedly it still only works occassionaly . it won't vibrate all music only plays sometimes . very disappointed .	1

i bought baby einstein sea crib toy based its look . i brought it home , put batteries it it worked 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds . i also disappointed ocean sound only played few seconds . i thought it would play 12 minutes like music . i took it back purchased fisher price aquarium it great . it plays every sound 10 minutes seems more durable	-1
i washed cover first time it didn't hold up . ends frayed there even holes where elastic band attaches terry . also little pieces terry got all over everything else i washed it . i'm extremely disappointed this product	-1
when your infant crying because he hungry you're only thinking how you want back bed , you not necessarily hear very quiet " click " reviewer mentioned unless you right top this unit . it already cycle through once ? twice ? i don't know . i never could catch it since it my kitchen i usually trying soothe my child living room when light went out . yes , it plain sight , but doesnt mean i caught it right time . what i know leaving bottle there , reagrdless it 4oz . or 8oz ., makes formula very hot . even if you it proper setting according instructions . then you wait it cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby . this went trash . only reason i gave it two stars because it heat bottle faster than if i waited water boil . otherwise , i just started giving my son formula made room temperature water not one problem	1
this tub waste money . i bought it this evening i'm returning tub first thing tomorrow morning . water leaks hinges creating mess slippery , unsafe floor . very unsatisfied this product	-1
first i really liked these , until i realized my baby just used 100 liners 1 week . it not easy squeeze air out . since i keep track how much our baby eats , how i when liner all scrunched up ! not worth money liners there plenty air gets into liner even if once while you manage get air out . i'm sorry i ever bought them	1
i bought this my daughter when she 1 year old . i could barely zip it around b/c it so small . i keep checking tags make sure i got right size not infant one . i looked some other reviews saw many people same problem . it great product smaller children	1
we purchased 2 these seats give grandparents when my son came visit them . right out box , seat pad wouldn't stay seat slides around during use . i figured i could live since it just cheap seat anyway . after only 5 or 6 uses however , clip holds seat belt adjuster booster snapped while installing seat into our second car few days ago . i tried contact evenflo report this problem , but they completely unconcerned failure their product . they told me they only warranty seat 90 days purchase ( you proof purchase ) . they offer send me out replacement part , but under circumstances , i don't feel comfortable using seat all , so i'll destroying disposing it . i explained we thinking replacing seat different evenflo model asked if discount coupon available reduce cost replacing defective seat , but they told me out warranty it no longer their problem . thank goodness this part failed while installing seat not during crash , or my son certainly would seriously injured . we haven't any problems yet other seat , but i'll replacing it anyway just safe . after their horrible customer service , i won't buying evenflo anything ever again .	-1
well women selling this product decided after she already sold me this car seat she was'nt makeing any money off it , so she decided not sell it me . so i never got this car seat . i really don't understand why i need write review it	-1
i bought this mirror because my son hates ride car . i thought lights music would distract him . after 1 minute hearing this annoying lady sing , i decided i would really rather hear my son cry . it far less irritating . remote completely useless because you press button mirror order remote work . what genius engineered ? also , it heavy it folds center after place 15 minutes . don't waste your money !!	-1
don't bother these . they expensive only 4 bottles totally unnecessary . it much easier buy storage bags . if you pumping full time , you storing alot more than 4 bottles time . i also found i not like these bottles feeding because they nothing prevent air entering baby belly result gas or worse , colic . they also flow too fast newborns	1
this sling very difficult use i could never get it adjusted correctly never figured out how breastfeed it without obvious . i used this sling 6 weeks it just killed my shoulder back . it uncomfortable not nearly enough padding shoulders . plus you still carry diaper bag and/or purse so just added extra weight . don't waste money i would much rather front/back carrier they work so much better easier use feel lot safer . only things i like pockets strap keep small things like paci , keys , money cell .	1
we bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived . we previously used diaper genie , we no longer - it worked fine , but expensive . we decided buy diaper dekor because odor free guarantee . don't buy it . guarantee or pail ! it stinks up whole house just one or two diapers it . we kept it garage , also outside . not convenient . refills expensive . worse yet - my one year old get dirty diapers out it through top - or get bag through door front !!! who designed this thing ???	-1
this product nice first but you'll find yourself time time again replacing it just so you don't put anymore holes your home . i've bought 5 them over 4 years . we expanding family this things keeps breaking . not buy , buy something better higher quality so you won't replace 6 months . please listen this review . it save you	-1
please spend your money different gate . there nice wooden stair gates out there seem pricey first , but after going through what we gone through , i wish i would gotten different gate . we twin girls bi-level house . stair gate must . 90 day warranty joke , because naturally , each gate broke after 90 days . same problem all four - knob just wont turn . i say - when it worked , it nice . but read other reviews , you see same problem over over again . shame me buying it again . it just broke this past saturday , after six months use . i contact manufacturer , but past , i'm sure i won't get anywhere . if enough people complain , perhaps they change design . again , please look elsewhere	-1
i wouldn't let my dog sleep these sheets . they worst quality imaginable . we took ours back purchased plain ole porta crib sheets they fit perfectly . i recommend koala baby name brand porta rib sheet . they available bru elastic all way around , making snug fit . quality 1000 times improved over pnp sheets	-1

i accidentally ordered this one instead kolcraft universal carrier , since they both called universal carrier . this car seat carrier over-engineered too many moving parts completely unnecessary . rather than returning it , my husband wanted eat $59.99 plus shipping beating it up baseball hat . we went out purchased kolcraft universal carrier -- it much simpler , easier fold , large , functional basket underneath car seat .	-1
i ordered this item . i bought directly baby universe before , but now i've several problems . i ended up cancelling this order because after i inquired baby universe , i told item backordered . they didn't know when it would available . i also ordered jj cole bundle me lite them . it arrived fairly quickly , but slashed through box cutter . i've trying get it exchanged , but their customer service lacking . i won't exchange it am trying just get return now . i'm not so sure i would buy this company . they seem slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle amount business they getting . disappointing . just got ra number item , but it shipped back jj cole who knows when i'll get item shipped me . they don't even give you address ship returned item . won't let me return . this bad way run business	-1
i need something i use top regular dresser , but this one i don't particularly feel safe use because it velcr o-o sides , 6 pieces wouldn't stay place when baby tries roll his side . also it fold line center not very comfortable babies back , cushion kinda sinks area . diaper cloth cover came it made cheap looking dirty white fabric . it looks used even when its not . which also not fit snugly pad . belt looks flimsy generally useless , especially when velcr o-o sides pad wiggles around unstable . i purchased changing pad childkraft . it way better than this one , just one solid well made piece so much stable over dresser purpose	-1
important : find mobile option it working , while silent w/out music . i thought this mobile great first 5 minutes , but then i quickly realized , i couldn't get thing shut up- darn it- they didn't put option it ! how this ? it $40+ dollar mobile . my baby just wanted see it go , but music , sliding beads put him over edge . this mobile too loud , sliding beads loud well . it stimulates baby too much . even after covering it up arranging it under bumper pad- it still too loud . motion actually quite hypnotizing great , but " tiny love " ruined it not putting " silent running feature button " it . i'd pay $60 it if it would just quiet !!! if this mobile worked without sound it would wonderful . it now , i can't use it much- only when baby his happiest . even then , mobile wears him out- ruins his happy state , because it too loud . i think i shall pry it open try break speaker . i am serious . i rated it one star , because i only use it when my baby his most rested happiest state . if he least bit tired , it overstimulates him makes him cry .	-1
this worst sunshade ever !!! don't waste your money . it so flimsy it offers no sun protection all . we used it our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into faces our babies . i not recommend this product . i only gave it one star because zero star not option	-1

size stated 3-6 months . baby 2 months old hat too small . anyone ordering should consider it runs very small . then because i used my credit card purchase it i unable return it get refund	1
this seemed like great idea but it doesn't work very well cloth diaper users , like me . i use top shelf wipes warmer side pockets grooming items such brush cotton swabs . however , since my cloth diapers won't fit into diaper organizer , i'm not sure what put there . because this , there lot wasted space . i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers	1
monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan using ac adapter ..... fisher price customer service recommends ac adapter should not plugged into reciever more than 13 hours time or rechargeable battery and/or unit damaged . my mind makes product useless if you intend using ac adapter -- you'll remember unplug it every morning or risk wrecking thing ! ( fisher price rep actually told me i'd " fry it " ) .	1
i bought this potty because i thought it soooo cute , looking like real toilet toilet paper roll everything ! i still think it cute , but just like many other reviewers say , all music talking sounds way too distracting able actually learn potty training . , like other reviewers say , sensor not accurate , so it always saying child went potty when they didn't . very confusing child who trying learn really " go " potty . we're currently potty training our daughter , we three training potties -- this one , older one soft seat , one fits into ring big toilet -- this potty last one my daughter pick when it " potty time . " when we first got it she blast it , using it toy nothing more . now newness worn off , she shows very little interest it . if i it over , i would given her this potty without batteries it without her even knowing it capability make all sounds . here suggestion : don't put batteries until your child mastered potty training . then , reward his/her accomplishment , put batteries show your child what potty . training part out way , sounds won't such distraction anymore	1
i bought this sling when my son 8 months old 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around see world . i hated this carrier because rigid straps cut into my hips shoulder every time he tried move . seller recommended making sure straps place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there isn't place your body where unforgiving straps particularly comfortable ) also said tighten straps so baby couldn't move around . i all these things still found it very uncomfortable wear . seller helpful product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead 1 . there $5 return charge .	1
we purchased this stroller because weight ( 10lbs ) ease lifting it/out car . two weeks after purchasing stroller we noticed stitching sun shade already coming apart . shade barely big enough shield anything , let alone provide protection child . we received replacement cover , but advised this would one time replacement . tiny cup holder not big enough hold bottle already broken off . our 8 mo . old 17 lbs . stroller very difficult maneuver . straight paths , great . if you take turn or change direction quickly , not plan stroller transition your directional shift . front wheels get stuck you kick them back forward or stroller not steer correctly when you going straight . pliko previously my 4 yr old , we thought we could trust name peg perego . unless you seeking light weight stroller not maneuver well , we woud not recommend this stroller anyone .	-1
somehow we ended up no less than three strollers : nice zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller , maclaren umbrella stroller , middle this red peg perego aria stroller . we nothing but bad news this aria stroller . what clunker ! italian , i am ashamed say this confirms me stereotype they make nothing works but everything looks fabulous . i am only slightly facetious . this stroller very sleek stylish , light-weight , but where it all ends . biggest flaw poor handling/wheels . pushing steering constant battle . sometimes it just doesn't want go . i really tried inspect where problem , it not look like wheels stick . rather , whole body seems flex too much when you push stroller . just gently rock stroller side side you see what i mean . other nits include aria stickers coming loose eventually needing torn off , baby cup holder both too shallow too easily removable . but biggest problem handling --- it not pleasant we never use it anymore .	-1
my neighbor nojo liked it so i going get one too . i tried hers , but i couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe hurt my back . i thought i could order different size , but found it only comes one size . i then read all reviews here followed someone advice ordered babymoon slings . it fit me better ( i'm petite ) lot easier use ( prettier ! ) . i think it makes big difference get sling that not bulky comes sizes - i don't get why they use so much padding nojo , it makes it really hard use newborn compared other slings .	-1
i think idea behind sling great but it not every baby . everytime our son put this he crys or screams . he easy going fellow but he hasn't liked held closely . he wants his freedom this doesn't give much freedom newborn . also , quot ; trainingquot ; video more promotional advertisement . i go web site get more information how use it	-1
" breathe safe padded sheet " also left mesh imprint my baby face . placing sheet over breathe safe pad defeats purpose lessening current routine : 1 ) untying bumper guard moving it out way2 ) struggling " pull " out heavy mattress crib3 ) removing washing sheet mattress pad4 ) wiping off mattress soap water5 ) replacing sheet mattress pad6 ) returning heavy mattress crib7 ) re-arranging dust ruffle8 ) re-tying bumper guardother than , it seemed like good idea . searching better product .	-1

bought this crib tent after reading all " fine print " returns . besides , toilet seats etc . which allegro medical not allow returns due hygenic reasons , allegro medical made it appear you make returns within 30 days . not when i tried return this . allegro medical said all returns " up their discretion " . they would not allow me return this despite fact i didn't even open box . very misleading never buy allegro medical again	-1
i so anxious get this when i finally , my daughter just not interested it . she barely plays it . i hoping this she would spend more time her tummy because she normally hates . maybe that why she didn't care much this .	1
we bought this product so i could see my 6 month old son front seat . but everytime i put rear view mirror back window it would pop off hit my son face . blinds don't stay up either . their suctions don't stay if there any moisture your windows when you shut your car door .	-1

don't buy this stroller . only good thing it you won't sad if you leave it somewhere . " restraints " don't restrain all . my one year old twins barely stay it so when we're store they reach very far pull down all sorts things . ( not safe ) stroller barely fits through regular door ways - i mean barely fits . it not maneuver well all difficult stear . " adult drink cup holder " snaps off when struggling go through doors i don't describe what mess . i'm just lucky i don't drink hot coffee ; otherwise i would suing manufacturer burns children . there no storage . " saddle bags " hold few small things but you should only use it things you don't mind children able reach . this stroller not only nuisance , it potentially dangerous features , so please don't buy it	-1

i swear -this crime ! worst product western hemisphere . never , never buy this piece garbage	-1
i'm big believer reading amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray ! but this chair ( which we bought specifically because everyone praise ) miserable ! i don't understand why it got such high marks ... tray way too huge easy cleaning it ( rather than chair ) " leg separator , " which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over place . we've also found tray extremely difficult hook onto chair , doesn't push towards baby belly far enough . addition , clips attach harness filled grooves can't cleaned well , so they're beyond gross , just after few feedings . all baby things we wish we'd never bought , this number one list ... i can't help feeling if we'd just closed our eyes pointed random high chair , we would better than this thing ... only reason it gets one star because i appreciate non-obnoxious print -- it nice not something display clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors . ;	-1
very disappointed . i bought this hopes relief pain pressure after i pulled pelvic muscle 30 weeks pregnant . it not helped me annoying . l-xl too large but s-m too small . material folds rolls under my clothes there nowhere extra flap material front go . i get sweaty underneath it it difficult get my underwear back under it after using bathroom --- which i'm obviously doing frequently 34 weeks ! this only pregnancy belt available shop i went . i wish i'd chance try others compare	1
i owned bed it very dangerous child . i am stunned this product still market . while it very cute , fairly priced you hardly get what you pay . my daughter loved look this --- her first " big girl " bed . until it fell pieces her it ! metal rails hold bed together , matress place , not properly planned out . if you even manage get this bed built --- which difficult , much more so than it seems first ---- metal support bars fall out when child gets into bed . it flimsy , poorly designed , dissapointing , dangerous . delta should ashamed	-1
i purchased this bed online last year . it looks great we all know our daughters love dora . however , bed disaster put together if your not handy , you would problably give up . rods come bed not stay holes , very active 3 year old this bed not last 3 months . #60 ; br / #62 ; what waste money , invest bed your child growth , something withstand active lifestyle average child	-1
i purchased this gate keep my daughter out kitchen . unfortunately every time you walk through swing gate you readjust it , which makes it impossible close one hand . even if you don't care one-hand feature , it still hassle adjust . i not suggest buying this gate .	-1
i thought this would great size . changing pad just very thin piece plastic . it provides no padding all . case itself padded . why didn't they use padding changing " pad " instead case ? very uncomfortable baby . ( it basically like laying out piece paper . ) i'd rather use those small padded things come most diaper bags	-1
i am previous britax owner . i purchased britax roundabout my daughter when she 4 months . 18 months she only 5 inches outgrowing it . since we such plesant experience roundabout we decided stay britax brand purchase marathon olivia print . i very dissapointed . i major issue straps comming loose while we driving . when we would get our destination straps so loose there virtually nothing holding her into her seat . huge scare any parent thought what could happen when you slam your brakes . it also lacked supurb comfort britax boasts . my daughter never comfortable marathon she her roundabout . rubber things go over straps also incredibly annoying . constantly slid down out place end trip chest clip my childs lap . coupled straps comming loose defentially not expected britax high saftey standards . i went through quite fiaso returning this seat after 3 returns i bought eddie bauer seat instead . so far i no complaints . i wouldn't waste my money this . buy roundabout if you want britax name , but please dont bother this marathon	1
this product waste my money . it very difficult put very difficult use . my husband tore it off day after we got it . i would rather use duck tape then this product :) :	-1
i bought this pump because it medela name i thought it reliable . i wrong . this worst pump world . everything other poster said true . this worst breastpump . i would not recommend this breastpump anyone	-1
my daughter placed this crib her registry , mainly because price . she didn't want anyone spending $500.00 crib this one matched style she looking . i found this set up " depot " store it beautiful sturdy , but didn't come natural . so i went home ordered it online . it arrived 4 days before shower(8 days early eta)but it shattered . first 3 pieces we looked split , chipped crushed . quite surprize considering box wasn't bad shape . we decided return it buy more expensive model(at local specialty store ) . amazon return policy amazing , click mouse next day ups picks up . no packing labels print , no lugging big heavy items post office , very simple . amazon gets 5 stars , storkcraft - 0	-1
we so excited try jumper our son , but very dissapointed this product . first all , he tipped himself right out it ! three strap design , it unsturdy back , which we discovered after he spilled himself onto floor . he seemed pretty intent jumping , so now we've tried stuffing him there blanket so he nice snug , but it still unstable wobbly . i don't recommend this product , fact , we going try different brand	-1
though this potty nicely priced , it worth it buy more expensive one . though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers , it shift around base , allowing spillage . removeable receptacle base way too far actual seat , so my daughter gets stuff all over inside , not just receptacle . inside criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it impossible clean messes out it . it serve it purpose potty , but i'm definatly going buy different one when my son old enough one	1
i've tried this sling 4 times my now 10 week-old son . i just can't get it work so he seems comfortable . he usually cries when he it . he fell asleep it once , but he looked so contorted . it just so tight against my body it bends him wrong way . pocket so deep it closes over his head . i know i got correct size . i've given up am looking better sling . right now we use our baby bjorn several times day , he loves it , but it little cumbersome , i want him able recline .	1
this sling only useful couple months because there no adjustable strap . there so many slings out there more functional you use newborn toddle	1
only good thing i really say this seat it comes pink . it hard find carseats not really ugly . otherwise i cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat not recline far enough back her head flops forward . i returning work couple weeks bringing her me ( i'm nanny ) i don't know how we going it may purchase new seat already . i would think if something deemed " infant "' carseat it should work correctly safely birth not when baby hold their head up	-1
freedom potty trainer looked like such good idea , but plastic very flimsy , when set place , it just barely reaches floor . it pretty unstable situation . separate kids toilet seat footstool would far better	-1
these bowls not worth money . they not stay table all !	-1
i agree water holder bit tedious fill measure acurately . i always follow measuring instructions , but sometimes bottle too cool or too hot , even though i practicing get it right . i wish it more accurate someone like me , who only 3 room apartment , cooling feature not useful	1
not only product get delivered 3 days later than expected , my child grandfather who construction industry installed seat entire set broke off bowl first time anyone sat it . nobody this household overweight	-1
i received this seat gift my baby shower , i thought it going great seat , graco market several years , it built up reputation . but i wrong ! everytime i would go out my newborn , i would make turn , seat would flip over side , it not matter how slow i made turn it would always same thing . i'm very carefull driver , specially after i gave birth my son . you can't imagine how horrible it , look throuhg rearview mirror , see your tiny little precious bundle joy , flipped over his head hanging . i would look place park , fix him seat . i move both passenger driver seat far back possible , order hold baby seat backrest , just so it wouldn't tip over , it made it little difficult drive . you might say , she probably didn't install it well , but you would wrong , it perfectly installed , i someone check installation my city , everything fine . base seat not completely flat , making it difficult seat stay place . this not just happen me , it also happened my sister her baby seat , we our children few weeks difference . i get different seat , i purchased one flatter base , one worked perfectly . i never buy graco seat again , i believe it worth spending more money better seat , i believe ones children priceless , investing money their safety	-1
same thing happened previous poster happened my son toy . turtle cup came off after first use ( within 20 min ! ) . my son 8 months old it can't even withstand pulling 8 month old . sharp screw revealed when cup comes off . luckily we noticed it before my son injured , unfortunately i remove it immediately which course upset my son , who no longer his toy play . i would pay more something quality so it sad amazing companies put out cheap quality products break immediately expose dangerous parts . i would recommend you not buy this item . i now waste more time returning it store	-1
my son ten days old . i tried these bottles highly disappointed . liners pain butt . once you prepare bottle get air out it , if your child not drink whole bottle it collects air again . i changed dr. brown bottles my son less gas isn't wearing his food .	-1
i using my medela pump past 5 months ( first couple months intermittently last 2 1/2 months daily ) . suddenly it broke down without any warning signs weekend . my dealer not open replace it this caused considerable loss milk supply me . thankfully dealer local dealer very good . he replaced " just pump " pack new one . per medela instructions , they actually want send broken pump over them they take care it , if it under yr old . it would very late me if i ship it they ship it back . thing happening my back pack handles started wearing down . i hardly carry them around . i am giving it 1 star because poor quality check must carried out such expensive pump . i would think twice before buying this	-1
like you , i read all reviews i could bottles , travel systems , baby swings , cribs , etc etc etc . i loved shape these bottles ( very handy when needing your hand - you prop bottle under your chin while feeding ) , concept " ventaire " system made lot sense ! however , 2 months into using these bottles , i became fed up wash all different parts , drying them thoroughly ( it must these things ) , " activate " both nipples ventaire plastic seal ; wasting valuable time energy should've spent my family , catching up laundry , cleaning house , cooking , grabbing naps in-between ( i also work full-time job didn't get home till 6 pm every night ) . worst all it if you don't install vent juuuuuuust so , it leaks ... person ( below ) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it right , hasn't met me - i'm 34 years old believe i learned how screw stupid cap ! it " hit or miss " deal ... sometimes i would go whole week without leak then out blue ... water everywhere !!! ( they're slow leaks too , so it not like you would notice right away ... it took like 30 minutes before showing ) then i called playtex ask them what problem , they thought my water might too hot breaking down material ... so , they kindly sent me some new ones . well , yeh , didn't work either !!! it great idea , but very bad design !!! i finally threw my hands air ... purchased evenflo version " angled bottle " now i am heaven !!! yourself , your time , favor don't waste money	-1
i thought this cover horrible . it doesn't cover enough area cart . it difficult put because all ties . i couldn't even get harness fit right . try one other seat covers instead elastic , you put them cart one hand , it completely covers cart , even big ones costco	-1
i bought this cover thinking anything cover cart would same . other covers i've seen just slip , this one tied . also , it doesn't cover entire cart . there opening , my baby fingers always find , where he touch icky cart handle . not great product . spend extra money buy better one	1
i just received this sleep positioner today it nothing like what i expected . description makes it sound like wedge adjustable - but i don't quite get how adjust this . it also says there blanket . maybe i misunderstood description because there no blanket here . i imagined wedge would prop baby up much more than it . thickest layer wedge maybe 2 1/2 inches thick . i'm pretty disappointed . i thought this going answer my baby sleep problems	1
i never written review , but this case , i feel compelled so . i purchased imonitor last week upgrade safety 1st dual monitor , no other reason than i tired interference . i excited learn digital technology , once i got it home , i anxious try it . after few nights trying it out , i equally anxious return it get my money back ... let me explain : begin , before you buy , please aware lights sound awfully bright loud , which troublesome since i am light sleeper . i would able deal it , but there other problems well ... there ' clicks ' ' crackles ' intermittent , , like i said before , not good light sleeper . final straw fourth night parent receivers lost contact base -- i spent half hour resetting it , reconfiguring layout , powering on/off -- all no avail . it kept beeping ' out range ' -- i only 10 feet monitor time . absolutely unacceptable . all fairness , we lot gadgets wireless may competing monitor , but isn't excuse .. it says ' crystal clear clarity ' ' 2000 foot range ' , but this not , i repeat , not case . so , i packed it back up went into babies us return it ... here kicker : salesperson store said she agreed they lot problems she seen more imonitors returned than any other monitor . she rec'd sony , but it doesn't come two parent units , so i resigned myself living safety 1st .. even all its interference , it still superior , 1/4 price imonitor . i no doubt digital next step baby monitors ... but so far graco not it figured out ... save your money give it some time so they work out obvious flaws system .	-1
i purchased this sterilizer two weeks ago , i used it all two times . it creates horrible mess water running everywhere when lid lifted , i really wonder if bottles actually sterilized . i am terribly disappointed this product , truly caution those you who thinking buying this run it like wind	-1
both my children get thrush very easy so i purchased this product sterilize bottles nipples every use . my kids still get thrush this product terribly messy bottle look horrible afterwards . if my kids keep getting thrush , obviously this product not work	-1
i given this gift , so thankfully i didn't waste my money it . this sterilizer so messy awkward , i not recommend it all . metal pan started corroding after only week . little flecks metal water soak bottom unit lifting off cover drench your countertop . all bottles nipples breastpump parts stay wet spotty , so i can't imagine how it could possibly clean . horrible product	-1
i received box shower gift , they worked okay , unless i changed them lot though , they ended up leaking . i resigned just living wet spots , until someone gave me some lansinoh pads try . i no idea why babies us doesn't arry them , but they really need . these things absolutely not leak , they hold tons liquid	1

we pregnant our baby due two weeks . we bought mattress our delta marisa white crib , ( you guessed it ) it doesn't fit . i read review poster here it says it doesn't fit their thomas tank engine toddler bed . poster assumed it may fit baby crib , but honest truth ; its one inch ( possibly more ) off . inch enough our baby foot get stuck it , mattress feels like joke , its too cushiony . we regret not reading reviews before buying it . if this mattress doesn't fit majority cribs/beds , then what it good	-1
i love how soft cuddly this changing pad cover . i also appreciate how many colors it comes . what i am disappointed durability . i 3 these used them just over year . they totally falling apart elastic . now , keep mind we use disposable " chucks " ( those blue hospital disposable under pads ) top this terry cloth changing pad . it makes it less messy ( especially early ) doesn't require washing much . i also washed them cold water baby dreft detergent , hung them dry rotated 3 covers we . while it nice product while it lasts , i just expected them more durable .	1
i say i just 20 min ago recieved this cover mail , ( i ordered online because i'm so far babies us location ) i excited first . color great , cover fit perfectly , but i haven't washed it yet . actually i return mine already because manufacturer defect fabric . fabric immediately shred elastic one area(middle long side ) . i plan exchange this cover same , i hope better luck next one , but man , hassle mail this back sit wait just frustrating	1
okay start . this car seat looks good paper but it . when it arrived box completely smashed car seat already tear it . if you latch system your car you must find , shove all belts inside seat . then pull them out correct places . not so easy . then order attach it base you must pull out metal bar once seat attached , slide it back . this very hard . so once there together it pain take apart . facing backwards , if seat not level your car seats , use towel or blanket . you shouldn't . plus my baby it his feet still squished into rear seat . once you turn it forward , get belts adjusted , you press button bottom car seat pull them towards you . this would work fine if base wasn't holding them so you can't move them . we took car seat off base so we could adjust belts . what point . once it your car way you want it suit it purpose but i highly suggest buying something better quality .	-1
i tried use these relieve pain but they not work me . they hot course they also showed right through any top i wearing . i too much company after my baby use these they required too much work attention	-1
volume control this totally lame . i can't get it quite enough put crib bedtime . also , sound quality poor general . i suppose it ok just playing room , but definitely not bed . you probably get something better sound quality comprable price	-1

i recently purchased this gate opening my home 68 inches wide . within one week use , wood splintered apart center rendering it completely unusable . i am returning gate puchasing more expensive metal type . this gate perfect example getting what you pay	-1
this stroller made very cheap material . merely after few months light use , stroller already hard push , wheels easily stuck whenever i try make turn . even less than half-an-inch road bump , i physically get front stroller lift front wheels order get pass . shopping basket touches ground whenever road little uneven , outside fabrics already worn out . not mention , sun shades no use all because they too small . without buying extention shade , they practically just some decoration make this product more look like stroller . it definitely not worth price . btw , their customer service terrible well .	-1
if you walking straight without turning then this stroller good you . but just try turning especially sharp turns--you'll stalling getting stuck entire way .	1
i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags it less expensive . well , i learned my lessen- you get what you pay . like some other reviews spring my top broke which supposed keep claw , if you , closed after you put diaper keep smell . i changed bag often but pail still absorbed awful smell after cleaning it soaking it , it still stunk ! i am now my second child decided buy diaper genie . i hope this work out much better	-1
pro : inexpensive use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags . add any odor disk available cup provided . con : not mask odors . i 8 month old triplets it doesn't help all . even one baby , change bag daily waste big bag unless one baby goes through tons diapers day . my triplets they still don't fill bin day , every other day . i original diaper genie my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd buy refill bags so much more often triplets . old genie doesn't hold much but it sure holds smell better . if i it over again , i would not buy this pail , which i bought two , one upstairs one down . if smell isn't problem you , go it . but if you're picky smell , research something else	1
problems i this gate : 1 . instructions using template install hinges , fixed gate , not easy understand . i finally gave up i improvised . doing so , installation went more smoothly . 2 . gate not sturdy . if anyone bump into it , i'm pretty sure it would break . 3 . mechanism click/unclick lock more difficult than it should . fortunately , people who using it , strong enough grip get it work . despite these flaws , however , this gate serve its purpose , my case . i bought this gate keep my dogs confined room --- which it . they don't go near gate , so fortunately , i don't worry them leaning , or jumping , it . locking mechanism , it annoying , i'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse . this gate would not safe kids	1
this flimsiest gate ever . boot it not cheap . i couldn't even use screws came gate . i use nails duck tape . instructions wrong sizing it up fit your area it took me over 1 hour put it together . unfortunately when i bought this gate , there only 2 reviews posted - one good one not so good . so i little confused but i needed swing gate . so needless say - i wanted make sure i put my comments so no one else get swindled . this gate isn't even worth $1.0	-1
these retail now $229 bru . just ridiculous . i own one , bought it ebay $28 since it local pickup only sale . i got heckuva deal , i'll admit ! this fantastic carseat ..... but folks , it just infant carseat ! i went looking ebay one , since , babies before , i couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 cheapo , often-recalled graco , let alone $229 peg perego ! all new babies sweat car seats .... they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months age , which when they grow out these seats ( unless your back goes first ) :) . i understand precautions car seats car accidents ..... folly infant gear industry . if car seats accidents , they're junk folks ..... they aren't re-saleable condition . when last time you heard car accident involving baby ? because how many new parents newborns who would buy $229 carseat ( read : first child ) go out further than trip store ? it regular old car seat . they can't much these , really , except change fabric . they pretty much prey your fear surrounding your new pride joy , so they gauge you your emotions .... hey , i'm sucker too ! infant seats notoriously small , so you buy up next size faster . they get your money car seat then stroller , before you out hazy new parent fog wise up . save your money ..... your baby or your back muscles grow out this 4 months , no matter what ..... then it $229 right down drain , faster than speeding bullet ..... guess you save it baby #2 . think it this way ... same amount money , buy britax roundabout it last 4 years versus 4 months , or go ebay buy one these , 4 months old pretty much brand new , less than half new price	1

i registered this tub wanting it very bad my newborn . i thought what great idea fussy babies spa not mention shower rinse . well , first time i used this it took more time set it up than i using it . also , button shower head hard press , sprayer needs remain upside down or it leak water allover your bathroom(found out hard way ) . when you use spa bubbles it makes water cold very quick . my daughter love spa effect , but i think she prefers warm water throughout her bath . one thing really annoyed me baby sling moldy smell it . i washed dried it many times cannot get this smell out . needless say i purchase insert tub , which doesn't fit very well , so im bit irritated . overall this good idea , it needs some kinks worked out it .... just not worth $40 . so now im off target purchase new tub : -	1
i would recommend seat clamps side tub over this if your baby moves all ! this seemed like good idea , but my little guy kicking moving all over . it barely floats sucks up water so it extremely heavy lift up hang dry when you bath . it also says it 0 months up , but i definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit	-1

we bought bumbo seat our five month old baby . her fifth month she fell her face it still attached her bottom . she hurt pretty bad . no way this seat keep baby place its own weight . please beware how unsafe this product . not all what advertised .	-1
monitor ok , but sometimes staticky other times just needs new " channel " problem button changes channel baby room not parent unit !!! also , we like second child unit elsewhere our house if both same time it seems cause additional static , broken signal ( only reset changing channel ) no signal . overall , i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews i expected better product than first years model i previouly ... i am goig back my old one	1
i bought this my daughter i too one light worked , my husband take light apart play wires somehow got lights work . i am not crazy bar where blocks go because it keeps falling off hood front bus . my daughter barely plays it music only plays when we turn bus . needless say i am very disappointed this toy	1
i bought this toy my 6-month old son grow into over next year because it seemed offer variety ways learn play . when putting it together christmas morning pieces not snap together securely kept falling off . also , one light not work . poor construction this toy disappointing coming fischer-price . i returning ( not exchanging ) this toy . luckily my son young enough he not miss it	-1
this such ridiculous excuse toilet seat lid . it easy enough install but hello ! what stop anybody , especially toddler lifting entire seat lid together ? not thing ! " kit " comes it secure it toilet rim joke it rattles around like crazy when it closed , it doesn't fit snuggly around seat so it completely loose . total complete piece junk !!	-1
we started out really liking this seat . its colors not horrid like most others , it doesn't cry " i baby !! " . it just looks nice stylish . also , our baby seemed very comfortable this seat . however , #1 problem this seat its straps/belts . first , you clip them together baby midsection ( easy ) . then you need try get these 2 pieces fit together bottom , so you clip them ( one ) into female end lap belt clip . this easier said than , these 2 pieces very difficult hold together you clip them ( one ) into other part belt clip . it hard explain properly , but really , it not easy , especially if you only one hand free . second , belts get twisted . 2 pieces base belt , which need held together so they clip into female end belt clip , they get reversed because belt twists . think taking your seat belt your car , somehow twisting belt itself , so seat belt clip now faces wrong way . if this ever happened you , you know what i mean , it pain fix . just like this seat . it seems get screwed up effortlessly , but then fix it takes several minutes . forget this thing !! we bit bullet exchanged it peg perego , after we used friend when we went visit them long weekend , realized not all infant seats sucked like ours . final problem we noticed this seat our 14-pound son basically already too big it ... yet peg perego plenty growing room . yes , it cost us $100 more , but it well worth it ease use fact our son fit it until it time standard ( non-infant ) car seat	1
i bought this my three yr old it not work all . we britax roundabout carseat there not enough room pillow . i returned it	-1
i so excited this product because it sold out everywhere i looked , so i figured it must awesome . not so . it loud , which freaked out my 8 month old , not suck stuff out his nose very well . i've tried every aspirator market , nothing works better than one they use hospital . i took one home me , urge you same :) very disappointed	1
i bought this chair used i don't think it worth $50 i paid it . i also fisher price chair ( i twins ) one so much better - i wish i 2 those . first , like everyone said , it ridiculous clean . those people who said it easy clean must either not really cleaning it or babies make very little mess . gross food particles collect every crease corner , especially under seat . most importantly , tray way too high - even 1 yrs old my girls uncomfortable reaching food it they average height/weight . tray also doesn't come close enough so there big gap baby chair - not dangerous but perfect all food fall through collect sides chair lap . finally , tray too big average size dishwasher so must always washed hand . fp high chair tray go right into dishwasher . only buy this chair if only thing you care how it looks	-1
i received this highchair hand-me-down . looks lovely , mine pale blue lime green , but infuriating clean . i never seen more cracks , crevices , screw holes , all where baby food slobber collect . after one feeding my hyper 7 month-old chair beyond filthy . you need buy toothpicks get all crevices . friend mine fisher-price high chair which much less complicated easier clean . price insane ( glad mine free ) . i would never buy this chair even gift . i would advise anyone considering this chair go something cheaper easier clean . i would give it zero stars if i could	-1
we love this monitor , but only when it not awful interference . unfortunately , evening some reason interference really bad all we hear static off hours . we not live apartment or townhouse ( which i read not recommended this product ) , but we wireless internet . only we aren't using it when there static , so who knows ... i love able see my boy , but static makes monitor really annoying	-1
we couldn't wait until our daughter ready walker . unfortunately , after countless times putting new batteries , we realized toy didn't work . i immediately contacted kolcraft they sending me toy . i also wished i gotten one mirror , instead i one spinning toy my daughter keeps hitting her forehead it . add , she only stays it 15-20 minutes . other than , i really like walker ! lol :} i think it better once we get new toy	1

you really get what you pay . i got this around $53 but i not like this product all ! bumper very scratchy cheaply made . comforter pretty cheap too . only thing i saved sheet crib skirt which really only sit drawer backup	-1
we 49mhz whisper connect love it ( see our review one ) . we needed second monitor replace 900mhz fisher price monitor 4+ years old , decided try this one out . we set base across room our daughter her talk her normal voice , we could barely hear here volume turned up . we thought we must defective unit , so we returned it got , we same problem . there no interference or static monitor - but also no sound . we're very unhappy it would not recommend it	-1
i so excited buy this stroller . it seemed perfect my 1 yr old daughter . mesh back would ideal hot , humid weather . it light easy travel . it seemed sturdy . most this true until i used it month . honestly , seat way too big ! my daughter forever uncomfortable b/c straps too loose even their tightest hold her seat too deep . minimal padding ( no recline ) she would bump her head side frame when riding around . top it off , frame bent after basic use . all we take it out car ! i very disappointed . maybe this would great stroller 4 year old , but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking something smaller than your graco(but better than umbrella stroller ) your young toddler . i think price minimal features it should better quality . every review mentioned carrying strap b/c that only extra feature ! this stroller not us !	1
this okay product many , many parts clean . spout , ring top cup , handles , plastic " leak stopper " , oh , cup ! all parts fly around dishwahser . i've lost many stoppers so i've order through avent . good thing they don't leak .	1
avent makes best washable baby bottles around , so we felt their sippy cups would just good . well we wrong . five cups we , all them leaked since thrown out . cups five different pieces vs other brands use three pieces , which makes them harder wash , harder put together , more pieces lose . far sippy cups go , these among most expensive you buy worst we used out five different brands . we great luck greber playtex . please avoid	-1

i spent lot time researching strollers , after reading all reviews aria i decided register one . out box it fairly easy assemble lightweight , but i not pleased it since . shoulder straps 5 point harness cheap fall out back seat . snack cup never stayed place . steering this stroller impossible ... we took it disney last month i almost left it florida . all all i expected lot more peg perego	1
my 15-month-old son pulled these off ( broke one ) within 5 minutes installing them . also , he able turn covers which ended up turning gas . bad design . don't waste your money	-1
high walls snuggle nest made it impossible try breast feed over , pulling baby down open area suggested , defeats purpose walls first place . i would fall asleep breastfeeding wake up later only realize my daughter unprotected .	1
one reviewer , though she raves it , admits its flaw : it cant put back into its carrying form . indeed , it floppy , illconceived mess . it basically works but there much better option out there : buggybag . this " floppy " not easy one hand install , it doesnt totally protect child ) one belt feeds through hold baby cart allowing unnecessary contact ( not all covers one reviewer proposes ) b)because it doesnt install one clean drop doesnt fold into carrying shape neatly you baby contact both floppy sides this floppy mess you try flop it out cart your car . after trying floppy mess miserable seat called shop'n'dine , i've found buggybag perfect solution : truly neat one hand install ; easy zip back into its carrying shape ; 2 belts ( one baby , one cart ) neat simply storage options . ( read my amapedia article ) dont take my word it , go big baby store try out both . just standing there you'll see there no comparison . i'm ... shocked there people who liked floppy , but sure they never tried buggybag .	-1
i got this gift registered it i pregnant my daughter . this biggest mistake . canopy not cover my daughter when she sits it . make it recline , chore . my husband hardest time unfold fold it up , not make fun him . he only noce thing cup holder comes out make it easy take her out . but even still it not good purchase not buy . we however buy peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it littl but more money . well , worth it . i would suggest we also macleran light weight stroller also very good .	1
after reading reviews this sounded like easy choice . i very wrong . when i first plugged it i could not believe how quickly wipes heated . i thought it great . i think they way too hot after they while ... but quick shake after i pulled one out cooled it down enough make it safe . then few days later i pulling them out inner lid popped open ... kept popping open every change . then when i lifed unit put new wipes ... my $700 changing table / dresser flooded warped ! ( i it replaced !! ) i not known it because pad basket table , too . same problems kept happening . so i called combi ... customer service told me instruction manual states wipes left packaging . she said excess moisture which caused flooding would held packaging . course i could not measure amount fluid ... but i am not exaggerating when i say cups ! even if it hold cups water .. so when plastic pacaking empty no longer wipes , it filled excess cups moisture then you remove dispose it ???? although it stated ... ) there should warning never use wipes not package ) why ! i bought large " bag " huggies wipes .. there no package pop . second ... she told me unit not supposed stay plugged all time .. this too , manual . so i lookeed , too . not " usage " part .. but back under " cautions " it states this : " unplug power cord when not use " . okay .... when you newborn .. when you not using your wipes .. lol ! she said it should plugged unplugged several times day keep them warm !!! i guess new mom supposed schedule ! ... if acceptable property product .. shouldn't there switch ?? i would move dresser every time .. or get extention cord , course ! crazy ! combi gave me , what i consider , ridiculous answers . they also need get real when they write manual . record .. i written review one other time rave my little bissell . this frustrated me so much i share info .!!!!!! also .. this baby #4 so i am quite familiar baby products .	-1
ideas bottles interchanging great . but unfortunately nipples cause too much gas . when they're using bottle , you hear constant air sucking around their lips . every time my little girl uses them , it seems though she just can't get comfortable them . i would recommend dr. brown or playtex ventaire bottles over any these . ultimately , convenience features aren't worth massive amount gas avent bottles cause	1
i bought this set my daughter . bedding such poor quality , my daughter won't sleep her bed . she says sheets itchy . comforter so hard it like big piece cardboard . i would not recomend this set anyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1

so i recieved this gift my babyshower even though i didn't register it finally pulled it out use it other day now my son older we're moved into larger tub only find out it doesn't stick wall . first i thought maybe it my older son bumping it whenever he taking shower , but oh no that not it all . then i thought maybe it i something too heavy inside when really all i some rubber rings i think maybe one tube crayola draw walls crayon . but yet again , darn thing came un-stuck . so basically moral this story whenever you recieve something you didn't register , investigate whether or not it not piece garbage before you open up box get past point no return . literally .	1

i bought this item because faq breathable baby website said bumper would fit any style crib , including ones solid headboards . however , once i received bumper , i realized it clearly not work cribs solid headboard . upon writing customer service breathable baby advice how it would fit , i told following : " breathable bumper wrap if your crib space either side corner posts . if it , wrap around outside posts . if breathable bumper won't fit your crib you should try cribshield which four separate pieces so you eliminate foot head board pieces just use long rail sides . look online see crib must straight railings not too thick so padded rail cover fit attach over it . " when i responded this information basically too little too late , it disagreed what they said their faq , i then told : " other option moms doing buying 2 breathable bumpers using short pieces front back rails . this way they padding . future , we selling them package way , but now you still safety comfort you desire . " i think it really poor customer service mislead customer into buying item then tell them order make it work , they need purchase different item or more same . customer service breathable baby since removed misleading faq , however , i now am inconvenience returning item . i am truly disappointed wish they could more upfront their website abilities product .	-1

i used this when i became too sore use my electric pump . milk seeps under pump guard it leaks out edges onto clothes . i wouldn't even say getting this pump when you're go good idea because leaking milk get all over leaving you clean up . i buy replacement part because bottom part screws base pump cracked sterilizing ( which it says you ) . they don't sell just one little piece so i buy actual pump again part . it cost nearly $30 order this part it took over 2 weeks receive it . entire system just isn't durable or made much use . also , cleaning down into bend this pump thoroughly practically impossible .	1

i could go into long explanation how i searched tons research before buying occasional use pump myself , who stay home mom . i could explain detail everything i try get this pump work , meantime before figuring out motor not working , how i freaking out my supply dwindling so i went out buy fenugreek ..... but , suffice it say , motor lasted me 3 months once , twice week useage . it didn't completely die , which why it took me while figure it out , but after paying attention , i could see vaccum losing more more power until when i couldn't even get quarter ounce one side i nearly engorged ..!!! least medela shipping me out new motor , this one i hope least last longer . especially since my warranty runs out 2 months ( 6 month total warranty- which me too little product costs over $100 !! ) even though i'm staying home only use pump occasionally , i wish i'd just spent extra $150 gotten pump style !	-1

i've co-bedding my 5 month old son since he us , but we recently decided move co-sleeper give my husband i bit more space . i friends who used it read all amazing reviews so it no brainer . we've run into few problems : first we modern platform bed low ground even it lowest co-sleeper several inches high so we've switch bed frames now . second co-sleeper mattress rock hard actually sits down 4 inches divider- since i'm used him my arms night nursing i didn't want reach pick him up . we solved both these issues purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses . now he softer surface snooze i simply slide him over nurse or roll myself right up him ... we'll remove one mattresses once he bit bigger so he doesn't fall out , but now it works ! hope this helps ! *** i'm adding this few months after use- i like idea extra space offered co-sleeper attached bed , but our son now 9 months old actually slept it only handful times ... still prefer him bed us !	1
i ordered this potty chair after seeing others all some negative aspects . this seat perfect ! my almost 2.5 year old daughter took it immediately . it not too small ( she very tall ) but not too big ( she petite bottom ) . it cleans up easily , not so lightweight or small it becomes toy her . seat part itself comes off use regular toilet , handles child steady him/herself . bowl insert large removes easily cleaning . there also handles base overlap handles seat so you easily pick it up move it . lid closes " just like mommy potty " becomes wide flat step stool . perfect product	1
i ordered this changing pad because it ends curved up , not just sides . this also sometimes refered " 4-sided changing pad " since all 4 edges raised . it seems very sturdy fits very well top my dresser , effectively converting dresser changing table . only reason i didn't rate this higher it didn't include non-skid pad bottom pad . also , it would nice if it included sheet or cover . next , i need order some covers it , since baby doesn't like directly against smooth plastic surface . i am not sure which covers order	1

i recently purchased zooper tango sidy side double stroller . i some looking stores extensive research online . suddenly , i found this amazon all places . reviews great price right . i bought it , little hesitant i hadn't gotten test drive it . this stroller great ! it fits through doorways , it little tight aisle , but we're talking double stroller here , it going little wide ! i 2 year old 1 year old , so i find it veers side my 2 year old sits , just slightly . it heavier than peg perego aria , but it feels much more solid . folds easily somewhat compactly ( again , it double stroller ! ) . it fits into back my honda odyssey room bags whatnot . i would recommend this stroller anyone twins or 2 little ones . my 2 year old likes " nap " ( recline seat ) while we walking . back zips off , she likes look out back . 5 point harness keeps everyone safe , but i find i usually just use it waist seat belt . storage limited , my husband wants customize basket area - it sounded like his plans involved hack saw ... there spot bottle water or misc items ( hanging net type basket - just big enough bottle water ) zip pocket back stroller . however , if you unzip back remove it , you lost this pocket . i read mcclaren stroller organizer [ ... ] - we planning buying this carry more stuff . overall , i love our new stroller would highly recommend it !	1
my wife bought this one when my daughter 2 months old . we feed our daughter bottles ( mix formula breast milk ) , since each time we need take bottled breast milk ref ( my wife breast bumping ) , mix formula , we use this warmer all time . also , when we travel out , this one quite useful . generally only little small amount water , bottle warm enough feed my baby . also it quite compact put diaper bag ( well , not compact bag though )	1
we've used this since my daughter 7 1/2 months old ; she now 2 1/2 we've never any problems it . this best stroller quick trips mall , park , etc . sunshade great built carrying strap good idea too . we've never used rain cover , so i can't comment . it doesn't storage basket , but i don't know many umbrella strollers . longer trips , we just take our full size combi stroller if we need storage or full recline option . i would definitely recommend this stroller light " quick outing " stroller keep car .	1
my son now ' graduated ' regular tub but we used this tub year . it perfect when they too big ' seats ' your tub doesn't accomdate rings . fact this much better than ring babies sit because there pleanty cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying stand . ours withstood year use so far we'll using it next baby too	1
this best bed rail if you not box spring . my 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed i purchased this rail because he " bunkie " board instead box spring . length satisfactory , fold-down mechanism perfect because raised hinges . it easy make bed well . we also purchased it grandparent house because they platform bed . it works equally well . my only complaint maybe rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't tempted climb over it . i would recommend this bed rail good transition " big boy " bed doesn't box spring ( although manufacturer recommends it )	1
ok so i purchased this when my son 4 months old . i always thought it pretty neat , but figured he wouldn't sleep it , because it seems glide too slow . my son wouldn't sleep anything , but his swing . i wanted get him something bigger may slightly imitate swing i know he'll sleep . so based reviews i got this product . first i little disappointed , because night soon i laid him it he would start too fuss like he everything else , except his swing . i just figured maybe i should bought it couple months ago . but , what i put one his big blankets it laid him top it whadduya know ? he sleeps it more than his swing now ! i guess it wasn't cushiony he wanted it . i kind noticed too , when i got it it appeared not cushiony . disappointing thing music volume little loud even lowest setting , so i don't even use it . aside it great . motor noise doesn't seem bother me or my son . it isn't very loud me . but anyway he sleeps it , which allows me get more me time sleep time night . i would say my money well spent	1

i bought this after fidning my 2nd child who 4 months old caught under headboard bumper came his bedding . this my 2nd child i never told this danger . i highly recommend this bumper . it comes 2 pieces , shorter one goes across front railing you move up down , longer piece goes last slat headboard last slat footboard . there only 2 gaps which where handles railing . i also able weave few places sides make sure he couldnt get underneath . i love it wide so it reaches down mattress , it velcros each end across both top bottom tight fit , it collapse if older baby tries step it but still very tight it very breathable but still little cushion it . i just wish i known danger traditional crib bumpers . thankfully i heard my son screaming when i . highly recomend this product , or one like it avoid suffocation hazard stuffed bumpers	1

very frequent ( often long-distance ) travelers , we routinely purchase airline tickets our daughter so she travel safely comfortably her car seat plane trips . we really pushed size limits car seat integrated into stroller ( graco travel system ) ease use , but once she finally made dreaded transition into larger seat , we tried practically every method moving seat , toddler , diaper bag , collapsible stroller , carry-on , etc ., our home through airport without ending up completely exhausted frustrated . all options we tried , pac back most consistently comfortable convenient . i'm not very tall ( 5'5 " ) , find i manage wear pac back , stow loose light objects ( such coats or stuffed animals ) car seat itself , sling diaper bag over one shoulder purse other , still enough mobility/agility bend down pick my daughter up or hold her hand . ( granted , i look like pac animal , but that small price pay free hands key moments . ) strap system intuitive use seems well-constructed . compared car seat bag , pac back much more easily removed car seat once plane , i never any trouble replacing straps minute or two -- plenty time seat my back time people start exiting plane . straps adjust easily enough my taller husband i take turns carrying seat when we travel together without spending lot time situating ourselves . only drawbacks : you really pay attention while wearing what amounts giant rigid backpack you don't bash someone or something while turning , straps may removed go through security if x-ray machine extremely small opening ( only happened once or twice regional airports ) . overall , amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product .	1
we love swaddle me blankets . we flannel fleece . this helped us getting our daughter sleep through night ( just two weeks using them ) . she loves swaddled but very strong would wiggle out then wake up need swaddled again . velcro she less able get out swaddle feels safe secure sleeps longer . fleece little more stretch it easier use but flannel little lighter weight summer so not overheat . not tried cotton ones . definitely worth try	1

gate works perfectly . however , it doesn't get 5 stars because installation instructions not very intuitive . i am very handy tools , remodeling , etc . i found installation take longer than i would expected . latch receptacles different sizes smaller one goes top . there " u " stamped it , but no mention instructions . nor instructions mention size difference bigger one goes bottom . how hard would ? one sentence ? i went through dry run figured it all out , but it doubled installation time ( took +/- 1 hour )	1

this gate easy install simple operate once you get hang how it works . my son one half years old tendency rush gates ( he broken two already ... ) so far , this one holding up . i would not recommend anyone use it top stairs because it doesn't installation kit , but hallways bottom stairs it works really well . it swings closed its own pretty loud if you let it slam shut ... we use ours kitchen so it doesn't wake babies up- however , if you use it hallway near where your kids sleeping , it might loud enough disturb their sleep . all all , it really good deal i would highly recommend this product	1

i looking double stroller i could get out my sedan easily . i didn't like tandems because they not only take up tons space , but they also very heavy . this stroller light , i take it out my trunk one hand . plus , because my kids heavy enough push , i am not pushing extra 25+ pounds stroller . because it side-by-side , it tight fit going through some doors , but i never unable get through door . my husband thinks some parts cheap look like they break easily , but 6 months lots use , we no problems . sun visors bent angle when storing , but i still use them fine i like they rotate down , so you angle them sun . i am so glad i bought this rather than larger , more expensive , heavier tandem stroller	1
it very safe because non-slip rubber . our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes potty . nice color too . highly recommended !!	1

i am very happy this potty . it high guard which works well little boy .	1
this graco family tree play yard perfect newborns . setup isn't quite easy description implies , simply because instructions all pictures , without corresponding written directions . said , little patience first time around makes setting up putting away play yard incredibly easy afterward . quilted mattress pad serves double duty wrap around folded up play yard when you need take it go . i find this especially convenient because it guarantees i won't leave essential piece home when i take yard me . description bit error regards mobile music . attachment sits side yard incredible variety settings vibration , music/noise , lighting . there different timed settings you use help get baby sleep . music not , however , directly attached mobile . also , mobile sits its own ; it not turn . bothered me first , but i quickly got over it when i realized my newborn didn't seem care anyway . changing table sits higher than those other play yards i've seen , making diaper changes much easier back . built diaper holder baby wipes holder convenient those rush changes . changing table padded easy clean up , though you need use lap pads or something sort , there isn't removable pad it . this actually my preference , it less stuff my baby contend , but may bothersome parents who think their baby needs extra cushioning . when taking this go , i said , it easy pack up . one minor drawback travel bag holds play yard . it doesn't handle , it doesn't fit all components yard . changing table mobile sit home when i take this go . reality , if i'm travelling , it more convenient not these extra pieces worry . however , i'm not sure how i'll pack them up when my baby outgrows changing table just using yard itself . i consider very minor consideration though . this play yard sits my living room where it incredibly convenient because it space hold all my baby essentials so i'm not constantly run nursery . i'm not sure what parent organizers intended ( they look like little soft-sided cup holders ) , but i've found them convenient places store extra burp cloths , pacifier , socks just too little stay together anywhere else .	1
my daughter started baby bjorn stand alone potty seat - which great when she just getting started idea using potty . she quickly became too tall use stand alone potty seat , so i ordered this baby bjorn toilet trainer it fantastic . she quickly learned how put seat toilet herself adjust wheel make it snug . it also easy her remove hang small butterfly doorknob my husband attached side sink cabinet . seat gave her great sense independence allowed her comfortable secure while learning use big potty . it also great traveling . i would put it zippered canvas tote carry it us into rest areas ( it really fit any toilet ) - she could sit securely protected unclean surfaces ( i would carry small container disinfectant wipes clean her seat off each time we used it public restroom ) . i highly recommend this baby bjorn toilet trainer	1

i loved this ! he always right next me but safe separate space . it folds up smaller than pack play , takes up very little room next bed , netted tent cover summer protect mosquitos ( or your cat who dying sleep baby	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked like charm ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1

this cup holder works great . i attached it pull cart i needed work put books , etc . after i foot surgery . it also works walkers	1
i really love this system find it met all my needs . my son receives only breastmilk this system made it so easy express , store , feed him bottle . i not found liner cost problem . nor i disturbed how many kits i needed buy . i think i bought 5 or 6 make sure i enough . it just depends how much you're going need store . but you don't need many actual bottles , since milk doesn't stored them , so price evened out me . besides , it much cheaper than buying formula ! i also don't care exact measurements how much my son eats . i get measurement just lifting liner out taking look . but when he breast , i don't know how much he eaten , so i don't track just how much he bottle , either . i just make sure he enough dirty diapers . i find system easy use because i express directly into liner , put bottle into freezer , then remove liner bottle when it frozen . this reduces space needed . when it feeding time , just pop one them into bottle , heat , replace cap nipple . easy !	1

my twins loved this one so much ... we purchased all styles available time	1
baby size : my daughter started out just over 5 lbs , this seat fit her well beginning . straps adjusted easily she rapidly grown , i haven't adjustment problems other reviewers . head support worked well too ( first we use rolled towel inside it her tiny head ) . baby head not fall forward long seat properly leveled according convenient indicator side seat , but if angle even slightly off this happen easily . seat only leveled center seat some sedan backseats ( like my toyota camry ) because this angle requirement , but there leveling accessories you buy help this issue . portability : i love stay-in-car base , which i found easy install properly . it also very easy snap carrier portion out , very obvious whether carrier secure or not . extra base great families multiple cars , either parent quickly snap seat go . carrier portion convenient quick trips out car , but i find it much too heavy comfortably carry long distances baby over 10 lbs ( i'm fairly strong ) . it not fit securely enough my taste child seat portion grocery cart , but it fit well when placed sideways across larger basket portion ; i just stash groceries large space left underneath carrier rest basket . snap ' go stroller great if you're taking this seat farther your car . it much more lightweight than large " travel system " graco also sells this seat . it easy maneuver comfortable most people push , but little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft . durability : i can't comment seat lifespan , we've only using it little over 2 months . few times i noticed sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned , but it doesn't happen often . canopy seems rather flimsy me , but we only use it occasionally when using stroller , so it hasn't issue so far . other considerations : windsor seems fairly gender-neutral pattern , if this matters you . my baby wears lot yellow clothes , people seem assume she boy 60% time when she this seat . carrier handle several different positions : up carrying , flat carseat use , down resting carrier portion flat surface without letting it wobble . handle left up , " wobble-enabled " carrier portion rocked slightly floor stall fussy baby you try finish errand before she erupts . i would buy this seat again . its only drawbacks its weight ( probably unavoidable since it carseat must sturdy ) rather stringent placement requirement leveling ( but least indicator lets you know this problem )	1
we got this monitor because other reviews we read it . we graco our daughter it picks up so much static other back round noice . you hardly hear her it . baby quiet sounds works great far able hear baby clearly . receiver eats up batteries fast some fed back only batterie use . our graco too so i don't know if norm monitors . sound best when pluged . nightlight great . humidity function i not figured out yet . it say it 19% every room i don't know correct . temp works fine . i not played enough it yet set controls how it works . i like time receiver it lights up see it night time . i haven't used timer yet but could see how it could helpful . over all - like my choice monitor .	1

i actually surprised how good sound quality this icrib sound system . it very nice features like 15min or 30min shutdown timer , so you put baby bed music then icrib shut down after specified time . nightlight also really neat , it cycles four different colors . only problem this product it cannot run ac , only batteries , so we'll buying lots batteries over next couple years , but otherwise this great product . edit -- after further consideration i would drop rating 3 stars two reasons . first , i found lack ac power source very inconvenient . second , batteries wear down , sound quality speakers deteriorates significantly	1

i got this system my 18 mo . old who playing game sticking his leg through slats his crib then claiming he " stuck " . they helped prevent him doing any more . however , if he mood , he easily dismantle entire contraption - so it won't work keep older child tearing it apart if they want . fact , two end panels removed because he wouldn't leave them alone . all all though , i think mesh " bumpers " what they claim they work well keeping toys ( pluggers ) crib instead out floor	1

i purchased baby einstein discover play center keep office days my then-5-mnth-old son , toby , me work . he immediately loved musical buttons sun , ignored everything else . he grew , he discovered other toys one one . it exciting watch him perfecting different skills necessary manipulate activities . because i used baby einstein secure place meals , it needed regular cleaning . seat pops right off easy cleaning , but cloth saddle little hard unsnap base . overall , assembly pretty easy - i put it together myself i am not mechanically inclined . i definitely recommend baby einstein activity center . i looked several other brands turned off all obnoxious toys activities . i wanted something toby could learn , not just dazzled bells whistles . i can't say toby learned any spanish language buttons , but baby einstein kept my son engaged even 11 months , when his willingness stay one place usually short-lived .	1

my son born february i actually considered taking this product back because i didn't think it would usueful . after using this product few times i decided i wrong . i {{ love }} this product . it fit perfectly my infant carrier . dressing my newborn son not process he enjoyed let alone put into carrier . bundle me i didn't struggle putting my baby any coats or buntings then struggle bulkiness get him into carrier order take him out into cold . additional bonus i found if i needed take him indoors but keep him carrier i didn't need worry him overheating . i just unzip top blanket pull it back . it like little sleeping bag . unfortunately , i think my son too big his current carrier when winter befalls us again . i think we moving carseat instead carrier point so bundle me less useful . even if i just use seat portion keep blanket top extra cold days it workout great . i already consider it well worth money	1

we originally registered this item because we 2-level house , thought this would help us trudging up down stairs so much . but , since my 2-month old still " lives " our room , her bassinet , part not yet issue . however , we keep this basket our living room , fully stocked , we don't even get up off couch change diaper . ( sounds lazy , but if you already kids , you understand ! ) sides liner pockets , which we use hold hand sanitizer , diaper rash cream , thermometer , baby brush , aspirator , baby nail clippers , lotion , couple rattles/toys , some chapstick nursing pads me . we put diapers , changing pad , wipe holder " main " center part . i also two wrist rattles attached either side handle , my baby loves look them while she getting her diaper changed .

i love this chair so my 5 month old . i love it reclines 3 different postions best feature it slides up down meet my level needs . feeding him any height easy	1
this nice chair , except brakes . they lock so easily if you just barely brush them your foot , they lock . it seems all you look them they lock . since we constantly moving chair us , or back wall , etc ., this real problem because you unlock them ( esp . if more than one four locked ) order move chair easily . baby gets heavier heavier becomes toddler , this even harder . pleats bottom seat pad probably unnecessary definately hard get crumbs out . if it weren't brakes , i would give it 5 stars . toy aquarium nice except they could make large push pads which make fish move around water , easier little ones push	1
my twins love these blocks . they received them gift 3 months old . first they enjoyed just touching them , each side blocks different texture . now they older ( 7 months ) these blocks one their favortite toys . they easily hold them , shake them throw them	1
great attractive colors baby ... but quite too big ( frustrating ) 5-6 month-old who just starting learn grasp one hand just learning navigate his opposable hands .	1
my 20 month old loved this when i bought it her still plays it daily now , 5 months later . i especially love fact it comes box so all bits pieces tidied away after play time one central place , there no danger anything gets lost . definitely must if your market pretend kitchen play	1

maclaren umbrella stroller best around . it very lightweight easy manuver . it worth price i would highly recommend this stroller every mom child over 1 year old . only drawback basket under seat only hold up 5 lbs . this stroller easy open close fits nicely trunk your car	1
this excellent lightweight stroller one we use most often . we more expensive , larger , " safer " stroller more features , but we found we never use it always use this one . collapsing stroller pop into car breeze , there adequate shoulder strap you carry stroller when you doing portage over rough ground . we take stroller everywhere . we've used it well-groomed trails hiking , museums , restaurants , we've even used it beach , we've used it paris metro . this great stroller train subway travel . wheels lock feature which allows them rotate , or swivel , rear wheels brake mechanism which little awkward release , but i find comforting rather than frustrating : i want solid brakes . there small basket back stroller baby bag , purse , few groceries , so this again excellent stroller when you just running out few things or going small picnic . if i apartment dweller city , this stroller i'd ge t.t he only bad feature : this not stroller you run ! don't even try . harness excellent , but takes time adjust it correctly so it not too snug nor too loose . this super lightweight stroller , but quality product excellent engineering design . it not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways just maclaren name it : this real deal . we used it two kids , still works like new . we should get sales rep compensation , because no one really these paris all our friends saw ours got one too	1
my son using this seat since he able sit unassisted . chair very easy assemble disassemble . it also dishwasher safe , which helpful those really messy situations . removable tray great getting mess away him , so i clean him up without him getting messy again . he now almost 20 months old , we still use it ( now booster ) . he tall his age , but it still fits him well ( plenty room grow ) . complaints it not fitting larger babies , i don't really know . my son very slender , but there quite bit " breathing room " him . we make frequent trips grandma house friends ' houses this seat very travel friendly . all all , this great product great price .	1

we chose this mattress because its firmness ( not too hard or too soft)and its vinyl cover . we went higher priced option , but not over top expensive . perfectly honest , we didn't know what else look crib mattress , i mean , how you really test one . well , our twins slept well together one until they separated into two cribs where they also slept very well . they 3 weeks shy 3 years old still sleeping mattress their toddler beds . we found they fit crib very well ( no dangerous gaps ) , held up changing normal use . mattresses both still look feel new . way , kids both average sized . we getting ready buy our third child . i definitely recommend this mattress	1
i bought this thing my new nephew i'm satisfied , his parents told me best gift they received , i recommend it , excellent product	1
after trying four other models safety gate , i am happy finally found one works me . i use this gate my dogs , but it would equally effective baby . it sturdy , easy operate , good-looking , unobtrusive gate . this gate not pressure-mounted . it needs screwed into wall both sides . however , i learned hard way pressure-mounted gates lot damage walls , they more difficult operate , they bulky . if need gate going relatively long-term , i now believe it easier screw it worry patching wall when time comes . i've also learned gates vertical bars more likely left alone because it more difficult pups get purchase them . ones grids or cross-pieces encourage dogs rattle them -- jump , habit i work hard extinguish	1
when you need babyproof your house -- especially those us who stairs--don't look any further -- this gate use . we this installed our former house top bottom stairs . very safe secure . our sons tried climb it , but couldn't--yanked it it wouldn't budge . our new house , we different type stairs no gate would work , so we installed these same gates leading stairs . our hallway wider so we just purchase extensions . perfect . it prevented our boys getting up stairs unsupervised . we just our third baby ( girl ) , so my husband installing these same gates again soon .	1
all medela products ( nursing pads , lanolin , bras , pumps , etc ... ) definitely best i've tried ( i've tried most all mainstream brands ) . this bra particular extremely comfortable sore nipples . i sensitive skin nipples i found this best there ( bravado too rough me some other night nursing bras i tried ) . material sort pantyhose type material where when you slip it , it feels though there nothing there but it protects supports your sensitive breasts ( especially important during first several weeks first time nursing ) . it not really bra you'd want wear evening out it more sports type bra it would not support adequately high impact activities ( like aerobics , etc ... ) but it perfect around house or errand running or low impact activities such yoga . larger breasted women ( especially breast feeding - i went 36dd 36g ) , this bra works perfectly me support comfort . it must anyone who breastfeeding	1
love sunshade . most part works well , except if you running rather windy conditions , then , it just flies back not cover kids so well . i really use my double jog stroller jogging am happy sunshade , kids like it too . only other frustration if you small child who rather reclined stroller sun close setting , you may not get good coverage keep sun out eyes unless you pull shade completely over stroller . . . then older child isn't too happy because he/she can''t see out !	1
these diapers hold newborn poo - better than anything . after watching lots friends wash their babies clothes everytime they pooped - because it leaked out disposable - i deciced got kissaluvs- just change diaper instead whole outfit ! we used these 2 months solid proraps bummis super whispher wrap ( my favorite ) . when given four - except - 2 months my baby started hate wetness next her skin - all - it would wake her her naps ( could use fleece liner solve problem ) they take forever dry - i'll hang them line all day then still dry them 20 mins . - overall they great	1

when my son began climbing out his crib , we cringed . we live townhouse his room 14 ' 30 ' space our walkout basement . one portion this area used our storage exercise equipment , however , so we very nervous he would pull something down himself . i realize manufacturers not advertise this use , but it possible link these gates end end order cover longer stretch . gate cleans up easily much less expensive ( even needing purchase two ) than other configuration gate options . our son 19 mos old 38 " tall ( very tall ) he not gone over gate- he leaves it alone ! he able climb over many plastic metal pressure gates . it take bit installation time ( hour both gates ) , you need basic skills install it . one other thing , my husband go out buy drill bit right size gate install- 7/32 " , so prepared . this best $200 i've spent toddler products thus far	1
this gate really adaptable attractive . i use it puppy safety containment . it works great	1

we two these rails three years now very happy them . they stood up plenty kicks shoves active sleeper . rails contracted when we need transport them . our twin mattress rails take up 2.5 inches off each side . i must admit i not know how use rails properly first thought they challenging remove . my husband , who read directions , installed them easily gave me quick demo how adjust them . once i patient enough learn how use them , it quick easy manuever them . these rails secure durable , ones last through younger siblings well .	1
we like this bed railing it serves its purpose more . this bed rail very forgiving considering my daughter always uses it bar climb onto her bed . don't understand how other reviewer said " it stuck out so far . " i agree other reviewer railing wasn't probably installed right user . if you installed it correctly , bed railing should even actually take some bed space ( 2 or 3 inches ) .	1
this great distraction little ones any age almost , but , not lose remote ! if it misplaced , falls out vehicle because little one heaved it over side like my guy everything , there no way turn it without remote ! both mirror remote use up batteries pretty quick when you let child play it turning it off . other than its wonderful sleepy time , night time distraction without letting your child play remote . night it lights up different places frame softly while playing music which isn't so loud its going keep them awake . i would buy it again or give it gift	1
i saw this item relative registry decided buy one when i getting ready our second child . i thought it would good way our three year old " admire " new baby without hold him all time . it works great that- but even better keeping our baby asleep ! he spitter , recently diagnosed reflux just three weeks . recommendation reflux babies allow them incline after feedings . this serves purpose perfectly . it keeps baby warm snuggly helps stop spitting up ! only word warning- make sure baby centered cushion if sleeping . our son managed wriggle over side bit .	1

babies/children always curious don't like sleeping much since it reduces their " nosy " and/or get-into-trouble time . our family love sleepsacks we consider them volvos , because their safety value ::( 1 ) reduces possibility sids - not necessary quilt or blankets crib your baby when he/she sleepsack . ( 2 ) soothes fussy babies - my nephews nieces always ready mr. sandman soon they their sleepsacks - probably because " cocoon " -like feeling ( so similar their time their mommy womb ) . they roll around ( once they older , course ) still sleep through night safely , so you get some sleep too without worrying potential dangers crib . get 3 ( 2 small 1 either medium or large ) you should good go . newborn size better suited preemies . choice medium or large negotiable because babies grow different rates .	1
great item good price . it works perfectly doesn't take up too much space even though it handle plenty items	1
this bed better than i hoped ! my son , age 16 months decided revolt against crib , opt mommy daddy bed instead ! we very leery putting him big boy bed so early age , this bed seemed built toughest safest . transition amazingly better than i could ever dreamed ! my son loves this bed not only started sleeping through night again , but naps it well ! it totally cute , design such even tough tosser/turner my son won't fall out - unless he wants ! even then , it low enough ground so no injury occurs . i highly recommend this bed	1
great bed ! although it doesn't support matteress we found if you get right one you dont really need it . my only problem assembly head board section could engineered little better . caps screws dont quite fit perfect . 20 minutes put together.my son just loves it though , if i could just get him stay it all night now	1
both our children marathons since they outgrew their infant carriers we extremely happy both seats . we found them far more user-friendly than other seats we used even though our daughter now able use booster seat , we continue keep her marathon . convenience aside , mom ran red light t-boned montero last month . montero totaled , our tank-like range rover sustained over $8k damage . our son his marathon when mom turned around make sure he okay , he gave her big toothy grin . not one single peep or tear little guy ! when insurance offered replace seats , we went straight back marathon	1
britax marathon wonderful . concerned parent i wanted seat would offer 5-point harness long possible . thats where britax marathon shines through all other seats i reviewed . marathon allows any child remain this seat up 49 " length or 65 lbs . thats equivelent five your old . not so happy color selection britax offers boy .

this great seat b/c baby just sit hang out it while it reclined kids get bigger it transforms fit them . our three year old uses it table without tray . when he found out new baby going use it , he said , that my seat ! so , we bought second one . also , it doesn't take up much room high chair we've know take it restaurants b/c it so much more comfortable than those boxy high chairs . we all know comfortable kid more like let you peaceful meal ! great product	1
this item excellent homes limited space . there no worries where keep big , bulky high chair . i also like fact it portable . just toss it trunk off grandma . it also grants you more options where you feed baby . you're not restricted wherever high chair fit . i'm also big fan able get my money worth out item . this chair really grow baby when he/she too big tray attached , just push it up table you instant booster sea t.t he quality chair good if used properly should give no trouble . only problem i initally chair reclining feature . it bit stiff difficult move but after first few times it no longer issue	1

i've used this foldable seat all 3 my kids now ( two girls boy ) . it so nice store diaper bag ( storage bag it came long since ripped so i store mine gallon size ziploc bag ) it goes everywhere . i put it our swim bag when we go pool too - it so nice able put kids it not balance them huge public toilets . they're more relaxed sitting themselves too ( which means shorter wait bathroom ) . i've read reviews pinched bums read them when i first bought this too - just careful all i say . my kids never got pinched but then , i put them carefully so it doesn't happen . just pay attention pros convenience this seat far outweigh cons	1

i using gripe water my son since birth . he almost three it helps stomach aches , teething , gas even calming his temper tantrums . my parents used this product myself my siblings	1
our 6 week old daughter hard time gas we tried everything we knew ( different holds , burping , gas drops , etc . ) nothing seemed help . one night we purchased baby bliss gripe water even though i skeptical it would work , it worked within couple minutes . it only thing seems calm her down when she extremely upset . definitely worth paying money when it makes your little one feel better	1
we love camping -- so this bug net great keeping over pack play while she slept , also great covering stroller while out walks woods . it such low price , absolutely worth it	1
i ordered this bookcase our newborn room - its perfect ! it just right height lamp top - so we read while sitting our rocking chair . only thing i didn't like backing flimsy board - but bookshelf up against wall it doesn't matter much . so far all books we've gotten fit shelves also . i would recommend this low horizontal bookcase anyone	1
we love using our co-sleeper . we not comfortable our baby sleep across room crib , i initially worried baby sleep our bed . co-sleeper lets our baby sleep close enough paranoid mom like myself hear him breathing night , reach him quickly when he wakes up . i also love it easy pull him into our bed nighttime feedings	1
my twin toddlers love this potty chair so i -- easy cleaning/dumping , sturdy sitting standing . one minus -- my son likes pull cushion portion off seat(while he sitting it ) . annoying . behavior-wise , we're working it , but i think manufacturer could made it bit more difficult remove	1
i purchased this potty strickly customer ratings not disappointed . it very sturdy , enough so even my husband use it seat when sitting our daughter . all parts very easy clean . i started her training 15 months , just keeping her potty bathroom her sit it ( her clothes ) every time my husband or i went bathroom . she soon got idea sitting it without diaper . because it took so long her go , we used entire unit , but it didn't take long until we started just carrying around padded seat her use adult potty . purchasing this product worth it , even if we'd only gotten padded seat . i bought second seat manufacturer keep our other bathroom so we wouldn't go up down stairs fetch it every time she needed go , but it isn't nearly nice . primo seat isn't just piece plastic hole middle . it thin contoured shape little one bottm . it fits snugly adult potty . it rubber pads plastic pegs underside keep it slipping when she sits down . i also like either boy or girl use it , without extra parts assemble or disassemble . there small rise front boys , but it isn't so high it gets way when child sits down . very sturdy , very easy use clean . can't say enough this product .	1
this very simple use protects my daughter bed . great investment if you early stages potty training your child hasn't mastered sleeping through night or naps without accident . i highly recommend it	1
reviews right . my four week old captivated this . i put her her crib awake she goes sleep . she used cry . only problem i wish timer longer or even better noise activated . i go back turn it back few times , but i believe this one one longer timers . if you problem putting you child bed . go get it !! if it longer timer i would give it 5 stars	1
this gift my daughter she loves it . she mezmerized lights movement cry when it turns off ( she still too little reset herself ) . characters cute , waterfall very calming ( even my husband i stare it ) , music noises very nice relaxing . i think it few areas improvement . 1 ) straps really hard get . 2)the timer way too short - i am always reset it my daughter 3)it would nice if it could positioned higher . instructions say 7 " soother mattress necessary which means it go head crib instead side until my baby old enough where i reposition height mattress . so , unless she positioned sideways she really doesn't get see it well . i really like this item it lifesaver getting our little one fall asleep crib ( she 10 weeks old now using this month ) . i highly recommend it	1
my son born 3 weeks early , small side @ 6lbs 18oz . this enveloped him very well , even nurses thought it great product should required all new babies . i love material , its ease use	1

i much research i could before purchasing two these car seats my grandson ( one my car one my daughter ) . this car seat always seemed rank pretty well , price affordable , so i bought it . my first impression car seat came when i lifted box - it so light ! after weeks hauling my steadily-growing big-for-his-age grandson his infant seat , it so nice lift something didn't feel like cement brick . straps very easy adjust his comfort , bottom liner going great those oops . seat truly very easy adjust , compared others i looked . my grandson very comfortable it . it wonderful purchase us , every respect	1
first all , kudos amazon carseat my house 2 days ( super saver shipping , i might add ) . secondly , i spent days , days , looking new infan t-t oddler convertible seat . i 05 trailblazer desparately looking narrow seat i could fit 2 graco turbobooster seats . it still tight fit but it works . this narrowest seat i could find internet . baby body pad definitely must since there very little padding seat cover . it work little while , but during summer i'm sure baby not stand much cushion around her legs , it make her hot . i'll figure something else out point . seat looks better than i expected inch less wide than titan . titan definitely doesn't work two boosters . i can't see any use pillow , other than looks . i'm very happy my entire purchase	1
my daughter loves her sleepsack . she sleeping one since she stated turning over her stomach could not swaddled anymore . we put her onesie underneath , when cooler put something warmer underneath . we've got 2 so there always one clean . worth money	1

1 . you can't beat price ... excellent ! 2 . easy use . 3 . doesn't take up much space . i've even packed it my suitcase it travels well . 4 . great warming food bottles . suggestions : 1 . only use distilled water it ... works much better . 2 . cleaning : once month use mixture half distilled water white vinegar ( 2 oz . total ) pour it warmer turn it . doesn't smell great , but works fantastically !!! love , love , love it !!! p.s. i've using this product 6+ months now .	1
very satisfied this stroller . i shocked just how lightweight it really . it folds up easy only use your foot release locking mechanism below . my daughter likes sit up , but i also recline it quick snooze . easy maneuver stores seemed fairly smooth uneven surfaces . very happy after going through more than 3 umbrella strollers i returned stores due one problem or .	1
after going through many strollers , this stroller definitely gets my vote . it lightweight , compact , lots features bulky stroller . handles long so i don't hunch over anymore i my umbrella stroller . recline feature also good . it allows my son sleep comfortably rather than falling front while asleep . basket also nice . only reason i gave it 4 star because sometimes wheels tend get twisted around get stuck while rough sidewalks . other than , i really like this stroller	1
i bought this tub my 7 month old daughter , who out grew her infant tub . it very nice . it just enough room her play her toys , but still small enough safe . it blows up just like pool ( very easily ) . i also use this my mother home , where she tubless showers , it works extremely well !! i suggust buying tub grips when you get it . overall , excellent . :	1
i like avent bottles lot ... tops extra wide able put formula mix , without getting it all over counter . i don't think these bottles seem help my son gas , he just baby , they generally gassy . bottles tend leak if inside white ring not completely dry first . overall i've pretty happy them though , i've never contempated switching . ** i however recommend just skipping 4 oz bottles buying just all 9 oz bottles ... my son 3 weeks old already taking 6 oz , so anytime we use 4 oz bottles , we make additional 2 oz after he empties bottle . i wish i just registered package 9 oz instead 4 oz	1
this very easy assembly worked well my 2.5 yr old grandson . no falling bed during sleep . he , however , deliberately find his way out bed rail foot bed bedrail stores well used over next several years . we found this safe product pleased this purchase	1

we purchased new graco " hands free " diaper pail after our 4th child born hoping it would hold odor like our diaper genie , unfortunately we wasted $49 . we used diaper genie our first 3 children , after sampling others , always come back diaper genie . it best keeping odors , just make sure you change it regularly you'll love it . diaper genie ii better than " twist away " style too . i would difinitely recommend this product	1
excellent item , well priced . pretty much like safety 1st " neat " diaper disposal system , but some improvements . we got this b/c safety 1st one discontinued we no longer get refill rings ours	1
i love new improved diaper genie !! our original genie constantly need new film canister , couldn't keep up smell my two babies diapers ( 3 months 2 years old ) . genie ii , other hand , no odor since day one !! film also seems last longer , since there no wasting it " twisting " chunk film each diaper . this produuct much easier effective than original genie , i absolutely suggest it all my friends !! finally !! diaper pail actually works !	1
well main reason i bought this swing because it plugged into wall instead consuming massive amounts batteries . however my son doesn't really like swing it yet he just likes sit there not move . but overall it good swing . only reason i gave it four stars because when it motion it only seems move one speed regardless what speed it set . great product though	1
we picked out this chair our daughter . we love it ! i put her it while i'm working kitchen she sits it while we eat dinner . she loves toy !!	1
we love this tub . we never bothered hammock so i can't comment it . we still use it she almost 2 years old ! we used reclining side when she baby used toddler side after she could sit up her . it so handy able stand up straight kitchen sink bathe her . before i bought tub , i thought getting primo tub because it such great reviews . however , when i saw it store , it looked gigantic . i took chance less expensive first years tub i can't imagine anything better .	1
this set waterproof pads very versitle . i found it difficult find bassinette crib pads this set both plus other pads , great value	1
this great quality sheet . it thicker than standard pack play sheets . it adds little more padding our munchkin . we purchased it navy washed it several times . color hasn't faded it just gets softer every wash . i highly recommend this product !	1
i purchased this toybox 2 nights ago toysrus . it pretty spacious sturdy . i really not like lid though . it not stay up very well . it just kind sits top toy box these 2 slots . it doesn't actually snap into place so my five little boys constantly take it off . drawers bottom just slide into open space under toybox , they not actually attatched anything either but they nice put smaller toys so they don't get lost bottom toybox .	1
i using mei hip since my son 7 months old ( 5 months ) . i love ella roo products . i also mei tai . key comfort spread strap across shoulder so weight distributed . it makes running errands work around house so much easier . it positions your baby hip so you more range motion than if he your belly/chest other carriers . i fully recommend mei hip . though i would wait until your baby hold his head up well there no head support so it not new babies .	1
our toddler this tub when he turned 7 months old , until year half old ( when our cat punctured it ! ) . it so fantastic we bought it again our next baby . this tub perfect size , comfortable safe because it inflated , travels nicely , our kids love it . our 2 1/2 year old still wants use his sister tub few nights week !	1

i bought this carrier b/c i saw my midwives carrying their babies it maternity center - they highly recommended it . well i bought it . our son this carrier since he born october , we april he still rides it he weighs almost 19lbs . babies these types carriers seem happiest . they spend 40 weeks you , what makes you think when they born they want away you.it also great babies colicit best wrap ever !!! 1 . this creates no pressure points all !!! you don't feel it your shoulders or lower back . massage therapist i highly recommend it b/c it not ruin your posture i feel his weight my thighs - which me fine - my legs getting stronger2 . i breastfeed him shoulder strap hovering over my breast while i hold him my arms - wherever we go - restaurants , etc .. people never notice they think he sleeping3 . you put baby different positions4 . they take best naps it5 . prepared all attention questions where you bought it how it feels6 . it it soo easy put , but you must watch video it comes . once you get hang it - it ' breeze - i put it less than 30 seconds7 . instead looping wrap through rings hold it place i just tie it into knot8 . you two free handsenjoy !!!!!!!	1
i spent alot money trying out new bottles various different nipples sizes . these far best bottles market . i read feeback other people left bottles leaking extra cleaning parts , but bottles perform really well . i never leaking issue them cleaning not big deal considering what product delivers . bottle helps reduce air gasiness babies get regular feeding bottles including over-rated playtex drop ins . drop ins too costly still get air inside them if you set bottle down	1
my 3 year-old daughter received this christmas gift . basket , canned goods , produce pieces very nice . boxes , however , very flimsy hollow cardboard showing wear after only three days play , so i know they won't last long . this price i don't expect wooden boxes , but solid cardboard construction would better design age range which this set marketed . my daughter likes this set very much , i think it give her lots enjoyment while it lasts	1
this one best gifts we received our twins ! both girls cried horribly when cold wipes touched their bottoms . which horrible those middle-of-the-night changes when you want disturb them little possible . grant you wipes don't stay hot very long but they take chill out . quot ; drying-outquot ; wipes , instructions say add 1/4 cup water if needed , which works great . we've only add water once , cheap brand wipes weren't very wet begin . i definately recommend this mothers multiples ! i plan buy keep downstairs ( our nursery second floor ) those in-between changes	1
i recieved this warmer christmas gift when my daughter month old . i think its great !! i haven't trouble wipes getting dry .... but those who , please note owners manual which says add some water keep wipes getting dry . no , wipes don't stay warm long but idea this product take chill off wipes , not make them hot . i don't any complaints this product i recommended it seveal my friends . i feel it definite must	1
this support used almost anything ( bouncers , swing , strollers ) . i bought it use my baby jogger stroller it works wonderfully . there actually snuzzler designed specifically baby jogger which costs more . this same product without baby jogger brand name costs almost $15 less ! i gave only 4 stars because head support kind thick pushed my baby head forward , so i removed it . but she already 3 months old when i bought it , so it might work well newborns	1
snuzzler one my favorite things use my preemie son . he larger preemie , coming home 6 lbs , but it still great help , he still small . it makes car rides enjoyable him , i think he feels cuddled it , just we cuddle him . it also great sit him if he rough night sleeping .... we'll sit him his carseat within minutes he out like light	1

my 2-year old starting potty training process . it perfect size . only thing could make it better if it wrapped around toilet little further . way he could stand closer toilet when he pees . i don't think you'll find step stool like so this next best thing	1
love this set toys . great babys teeth work cordination.my grand son just loves this set.so happy i found it	1

this monitor initially indispensable caring our twins . default channel too much static use , but once we switched over ' ' setting , stopped problem . i hear everything through monitor , even able distinguish my two children breathing . i love option turn off sound see whether babies noisy - one my girls hated bedtime until she few months old , this allowed us let us see whether she still crying after 5 minutes without go room or listen i-hate-bedtime screaming . after nine months daily use , receiver stopped working , but this decent value price . i found safety first monitor i bought picked up sounds this one base , but increased sensitivity . it would nice if nightlight could turned without monitor relaying sound , but option turn nightlight off fine	1

crib set itself stunning- if you like something contemporary . i ordered it baby age same thing happen- received pink feeding pillow . they weren't very helpful or pleasant way they handled transaction . they not honour advertised price . i ended up buying ultra bedding set local boutique	1
i own 2 these - one each stroller . it so convenient keeping my daughter toasty without mess bulky sweaters coats only need removing once we reach our destination . also saves me trouble wake her - i just peel back top cover , or zip it off altogether . also , i've received countless compliments how stylish practical it , not mention water resistent , which great seattle !	1

great seat . we read reviews somewhere complaining their infant head flopped forward this seat . i installed it so it more reclining position while still within range- per level indicator . we no trouble although we always support his head car seat so it cant flop around .	1
these simply best bottles . far leaks go ... you probably cap screwed down too tight ... what happened us ... loosen it little voila ... no more leaks .	1
my husband i purchased avent bottles our newborn after doing our research best bottles helping minimize gas , colic etc ... yikes ! needless say , we highly disappointed avent . recommendation our pediatrician , we went out bought new set dr. brown bottles --- kine pricey , but worth every penny !! avent , my son getting super gassy colicky . he would cry so hard gas pains he'd clinch his little fists , crunch his little legs his tummy practically go hoarse . burping , mylicon gripe water didn't even help . our days nights sleepless -- he wouldn't nap because he crying -- our nights would average 3-4 hours sleep . now , dr. brown's---our son new little man . he still gets gas , but not like he avent bottles . all it takes couple little pats his back he gives us couple good burps he out into la la land---he now able take his naps sleeping anywhere 6-8 hours through night now past 2 weeks --- he only 1 month old . :) some reason , when he feeding avent , he would suck uncontrollably , i'd see lots bubbles his bottle nipple i could hear him sucking all air . dr. brown , he way more controlled sucking , it much more rhythmic no air bubbles nipple ! many thumbs up dr. brown's!	1
5 months old no colic , no spit ups . these bottles great . you could shake them seconds bubbles disapear . while you feed your little one watch amazed there no bubbles . it takes while clean them . you just gotta it when your little one asleep	1

" baby " gate extensions fantasticly easy install i am extremely happy my purchase . extensions added mere seconds . this perfect choice keep my dog out area he not allowed into	1
we big gap before our bedroom , we needed fact 2 these extensions make our gate fit . now one , it seemed it would sturdy , but 2 extension , it gets little flimsy whole gate fall off wall if you press foot pedal too hard or shove gate mistake ..	1
my husband i received this warmer our baby shower while it great not walk downstairs warm bottles early morning feedings , after sofia hit 5 months , we never used it again . she 9 months old now it sits shelf her nursery waiting baby #2 . i wouldn't buy it myself , but i'd give it gift . i say because it'll get more mileage than typical cute outfit cost same .	1

this great addition my medela [ ... ] pump ( car adapter ) . when i pump work , it frees my hands other things . it may take few extra seconds attach , but worth it . only drawback hooks attach bra . they easily fall off when not use . i remember take them off put them somewhere safe	1
beware this product not contain normal sized medicines . they only 1/2 oz bottles gas drops , saline drops , acetomeniphen , decongestant , only 3/16 oz teething gel . you go through any these medications very quickly . but probably why kit costs $20 instead jj $40 one . it good this stuff emergencies when you don't know what you need ahead time . my baby loved taste gas drops , but we used up bottle week unfortunately . little fevers wonderful bring her first shots but didn't last much longer than . nasal aspirator wonderful ... so much easier her nose than hospital one ! it also clear tip so you see when it needs clean out . i wish it came electrolytes packet too , but i guess you can't everything . it worth $20 ( almost ) everything you need your fingertips , but i wish i didn't replace medicines so soon . i would still recommend this over jj kit since you never know what you'll need what you won't use .	1
my friend bought this me because she swore it her son . it excellent . first all , i must say , gas drops just amazing . my daughter so many problems colic gas i used them all time . they work wonders . saline drops great winter during cold season . i already repurchase few items . case great because it keeps everything one place so i don't search stuff .	1
my husband i tried many different bottle types brands decided these best . my 6 week old daughter adjusted well them . original brown nipples wear out very quickly but , silicone ones much nicer last longer . these bottles very easy use clean . my husband prefers soft bottle liners over preformed dropins . soft ones haven't leaked us once but formed ones slipped out under ring couple times spilling formula everywhere . formed ones also make it harder screw lid tight enough causing leaks . soft liners might take little bit longer put bottle deal , but long run it takes less time because you don't go change your clothes every time preformed ones leak . they worth every penny i spent them . even though they may cost more than standard bottles because buy liners , they help prevent gas colic . they absolutely wonderful	1
we got this our son when he 1 yr old , it looks brand new , year later . our child average size , he got plenty room it , age 2 . we live major city , so our stroller gets lot use . this blanket very durable , grows your child , keeps them warm comfy coldest temperatures . stays place , easy install/remove	1

not exactly your little little ones . this type toy baby who ready explore . but otherwise great fun toy it smells good too	1
i would highly recommend this booster parents their children reach proper height weight . it comfortable , light easy maneuver . able put straps across child proper height ( adjustable way ) extremely important their safety - since you use straps car , they go right over bulky winter clothing without readjust like our old seat . i would strongly encourage people remember belt seat even when no one using it . it could become quite projectile during accident if not secured	1
i purchased this booster seat my middle child . she very tiny , so i didnt want seat no back . this seat very padded , very comfortable , she loves arm rests flip up down . i some research before purchasing , this seat rated well . it rated well safety comfort . it also easy install light weight .	1
we've using our diaper dekor more than two years now . all time , dekor held up wonderfully . after hearing friends complain two-handed requirements diaper genies like , we went dekor because easy , one-handed operation appealing -- just stomp pedal throw diaper . we also glad product so well-reviewed ; it turns out those good ratings very well deserved . our dekor works so well we keep it family room , where we spend most our time ( bonus : we don't run upstairs every time we need change diaper ! ) -- we certainly wouldn't if there odor problem . only time we've noticed any odor during summer , when it really hot contents get ... ah ... ripe faster , even then it only when lid open . other than few super-hot weeks each year , we empty dekor once week all well . interior dekor , where diapers collected , gotten touch stinky over last couple years , but you don't smell it until you open door empty unit . little lysol helps , but frankly , long smell doesn't " escape " dekor , it non-issue us -- so far , so good ! refills may seem more expensive than other systems , but they last forever . my first son , we used only four refills two years . i highly recommend dekor , wouldn't even consider diaper disposal system . hope you're happy it we	1
after searching searching " perfect " car seat ( still affordable ) we found graco snugride . it easy install , after you buckle seatbelt just make sure you pull your seatbelt all way out until you hear your " autolock " kick then slowly release seatbelt back . once it back your seatbelt hold seat place without testher strap . my daughter using this car seat 6 months now i haven't issue it . it easy take out base or without my daughter it . i love 5 point safety points it , it makes me feel like she truly safe she , she grows it easy adjust straps	1
we use this storage feeding set every day . we bought other feeding bottles , but breastmilk these bottles sure creates convenience great speed . we use these store milk freezer and/or fridge , then whenever baby hungry daddy or/and sitter simply attaches nipple cap , places bottle bottle-warmer - voila - it all ready matter few mins . no fuss transferring milk freezer bags into bottles . also , because nipple bottle when bottle placed warmer , nipple gets all warm supple , which our baby prefers ( rather than cold/harder nipple )	1
this excellent double bedrail , once it put together , it very easy remove , resize , put bed , etc . we double bedrail folds travel but getting it fit under mattress pain . first years rail makes adjustment easy . but prepared - it comes completely apart takes tools , patience , time put together . our other bedrail much easier put together	1
i got this my second kid , i would going crazy without it ! my baby too small(6 1/2lbs ) my baby bjorn(8lbs min . ) which i used my toddler when he baby . i go anywhere , anything while wearing it , my toddler my full attention while i'm keeping my baby close . it so easy breastfeed , no adjustments needed like bjorn , no one even tell ! my toddler 30lbs even enjoys ride sometimes fun ! those who complain pain should first put strap over shoulder bone , not muscle , then realize you still carrying baby your body sling won't make weight disapear ! when my toddler it , i'm still carrying 30 lbs but it spread over my body , not just my arms hip ! i not any problems straps loosening , it fits me perfectly i'm 5'6 " . i highly recomend it , just realize it may take getting used if you aren't used carrying weight your back . this sling awesome it doesn't make me feel like hippi	1
i would whole heartedly recommend this product . i tried diaper genie could never figure out how change out bag , or hardly how use thing . diaper dekor , i pulled it out box it ready go . when it time change liner ( which last long time , i shocked ) it very straight forward . it didn't even require reading directions ( who time when you baby after reading all parenting books other safety manuals ) . it bit more expensive , but definitely worth extra $10 hands free bag changing ease . plus , if diapers sit it less than week it really doesn't start smelling very much , but go over week you start smell it	1
strange title , i know , but keep reading you'll understand it perfectly . first all , liners last long time easy use refill . i really like how there very handy very child safe cutting blade liners mounted onto inside lower changing door . i noticed some reviewers stating they problems item controling odor , while most other no trouble all . taking this into account , i purchased my diaper dekor open mind . i no trouble first 5 months . then i also noticed odor my son room , even when unit empty , after i wiped down outter lid , inner lid , flaps , inside out . then it occured me : there condensation inside liner bag when i emptied it then used blade cut it . i wondered if maybe bacteria or something moisture now blade then causing smell . so , i pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto blade see what would happen . smell went away . i then thought , " that just too easy , bit crazy . it can't simple " . so , i waited until i noticed smell again couple months later . i used hand sanitizer again , lo behold , smell once again went away . gist it , if you're going put wast material into something where it going sit few days before you get rid it , it going start decompose . diaper dekor great controlling those icky germs bacteria keeping them one safe place . problem , decomposisition creats heat , more decomposing solid matter , longer sits , warmer it all becomes . so , if temperature inside your waste recepticle warmer ( which it ) than surrounding room temperature , condensation form . so when you cut liner empy unit , clean blade . no odor . no problems	1
i love using system . it great upstairs not really yell . monitor allows us tell them we coming help them . they know we way help them or scare away monsters night	1
person this blanket very cute very soft it perfectly matches all other items zanzibar line . two giraffe design you see picture above embroidered lower right hand corner blanket other than caramel colored ultrasuede hem around edges , it only design . dimentions blanket not listed above but it 29 " 39 " slight amount stretch pulling it across width but doesn't any stretch pulling it across length . this makes blanket easy use swaddling infant . it made 100% polyester but you'd never know it feel . it looks feels just like softest fluffy fleece yet when you wash blanket it doesn't shrink . care instructions machine wash cold separately tumble dry low . not iron or use bleach .	1
we tried couple different solutions " head-flop " problem newborn carseat . these worked best . they're easy adjust even when they're closed ( velcro very strong ) which plus when you don't want wake baby up	1
i 4 potty , this far best one . i even bought baby bjorn thinking it would best which wrong . this only potty prevents my son leaking without hard deflector hurt his thighs . i admit he really liked his elmo seat ( which horrible deflector among other things ) so i bought elmo stickers stuck them very outer edges sides so now he loves this seat well , sometimes it takes lot time waiting your little one go i've noticed this seat there no red marks anywhere his body this potty , it very soft no hard seems . price unbelievable .	1
i love this product . our baby loved swaddled this product worked perfectly ! because you velcro it closed , it didn't come undone during night . i purchased one every new mom i know	1
i've got active fun loving baby boy . most babies , he goes through several changes clothing frequently . i use this tote bin his laundry bin , it works great ! i keep it next his crib , just throw whatever needs washing into it , clothes , bedding , toys , whatever . after it filled , it makes good small/medium load washing . it attractive looking , stands up well its own , 2 cutout reinforced holes easy toting , contains messes well . it also doubles toy/mess pickup bin , great tote toys or other items . size not too deep reach into , adults or babies . if you fill this tote w/ small toys , baby play w/ it quite while , taking things out , putting things back looking mirror side . since it soft bin , no need worry baby would bump little head it . i think this better size/depth than sea life pop up organizer . i exchanged organizer this , love convenience it(the organizer no handle tote around , too deep get people w/ bad backs or small children ) . i also matching toy box , which i also love very much . they look great together my son nursury , both durable , easy clean , safe baby play	1
my son would easily fall asleep , but hard time staying asleep . we tried swaddling him blankets , but he would always escape no matter how tight we thought we it wrapped . velcro swaddle me blanket helped keep him buddled tightly . he would smile me when i would get blanket out before he went sleep . my son born early summer so flannet blanket worked awhile , but cotton blanket great hot nights . my baby almost 10 pounds when he born 22 inches long so i ended up buying large size eventually . small size still got lot use since we used it every night . my son doesn't need swaddled so tightly likes his hands free , now he 4 months old , but i sometimes use small size naps . you wrap it lower body secure baby legs , but they their hands free . i lots friends babies right now ; swaddle me blanket always included part their gift .	1

fisher price ( fp ) designs many bouncers , but this style best due leg design . some fp bouncers very stiff legs so they not bounce easily . legs curve/bow out seat ( check out image product ) . because this leg design you easily place your foot bounce baby . my baby fall asleep me bouncing then i turn vibration leave her . i wasn't crazy pink design , but i know leg design offered bunny print well , but appears discontinued . key thing find fp bouncer legs curve/bow out seat base	1
i loved fact this folded half so it gives you more space your trunk groceries . it soooo narrow it fit any ailes stores . it really easy open close . only reason i didn't give it five stars because i lift infant seat up every time i wanted get my diaper bag underneath . basket soooo small very hard get when infant carrier place so i would put my cell phone , keys , wallet three pockets handle solved problem	1
i bought this carrier shortly before i flew my baby first time . we peg car seat , i didn't want schlepp my peg stroller through airport , etc . while vacation . my surprise , i find i use my combi flash much more often than my peg stroller . it very lightweight , very easy pop open , held up well through various trips . i also like it handlebar goes all way across , because it much easier steer ( especially one-handed ) . my husband also tricky time removing plastic parts you pull off order make this work peg ; once they off , though , stroller breeze . i would give one word warning : you careful this stroller it ( 1 ) popped all way open ( there audible clicking noise when this happens ) ( 2 ) car seat carrier strapped . peg carseat sort just rests top carrier , which makes it bit susceptible tipping over uneven surfaces .	1
if you fussy baby or just bottle feed , dr. brown best . we twin girls first 3 months they gased up it not fun . someone recommended dr. brown bottles , which we willing try anything , they best thing we ever used . if you fussy baby then you know what i am talking . if you giving gift baby shower , this best gift you could give . i can't say enough good things dr. brown . i upset our doctor not tell us these bottles , instead she us giving them drops buying most expensive formula market . nothing worked until these bottles	1

i've waited while add my 2 cents this pump , i honestly say it keeper . it very comfortable efficient . i still pump 2x day my daughter now 11 months . love embrace	1
this great pump ! first i looking pumps cost around $70 range . i am so glad i decided spend extra money ! my daughter not too keen breastfeeding it just turned into horrible experience i'd like forget . hospital i provided medela pump . ouch !!! my breasts sooo sore using thing , it not comfortable all ! cups breast this hard plastic when it would pump , my poor nipples getting so sore then i use nipple cream make them feel better . i actually could not anything my breasts while i hospital because they so sore . it made me so grouchy i just let everything hang out . i didn't care who came room !!! when i came home started using playtex pump , it such relief ! cups breasts soft rubbery feel them they didn't stretch or pull my nipples while pumping . 5 speed/suction controls very nice . it come storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy . i buy 2 extra storage kits so i enough contraptions use storing milk . i really hope makes sense ! then there liners . i liners coming out my ears ! i guess that how playtex makes their money , you buy tons liners ( don't forget storage kits ) . pump little loud when suction set higher . i used it 4 months everything worked great . i definitely recommend this pump . i would given it 5 stars but my only gripe spending extra money storage kits countless number liners you buy . but ... it world difference medela playtex .	1

my wife i 3 children ages 3 under so we've got baby monitors all over house . we've used i think total 5 differet models 4 different manufacturers including fisher-price , graco , summer , sony . we've used both audio/video audio only . this fisher-price model far best we've used . - range . we approximately 1500 sqft floor where we sleep . our bedroom opposite end floor youngest baby room . other receives either didn't pickup all or when they they full static background noise so much so there continual hissing static we constantly endure . this receiver set very low volume so background noises almost silent but baby still easily heard . - rechargable . other monitor receivers it hassle move room room . you unplug receiver find somewhere else plug it . one other models offer battery backup but we didn't use it fear going through batteries all time . this receiver built rechargable battery . unplug it take it you . when you're plug it back it charges ready next use . we're very pleased not only quality but also price . amazon price nearly $30 less than babies us	1

we use this constantly every room our house . let you keep baby bed you without fear rolling over him , makes any flat surface into comfy baby bed	1
we loved idea this item ... we didn't use it our bed but crib instead bassinette , when we away home , or sofa . our son 22 " birth so he outgrew this ( unfortunately ! ) time he month old . it really only suitable small babies . also , " mattress " split two due folding capacity ( not sure how else this though ) which makes it seem somewhat less comfortable . only one half removable , washable cover .	1
my son thought toys attached potty really interesting , sounds kept him entertained . it helped him get over fear sitting potty . we move regular potty actually get him use potty though .	1
this wonderful product ... whenever it says or sings anything it brings bright smile my sons face . very easy assemble just plain great	1
we bought this stroller take recent trip europe it perfect travel stroller . i lot research strollers i really leaning towards getting maclaren , but when we went actually looked all different strollers this one stood out . it much lighter than maclaren it snack tray , which incredibly useful if your child old enough use sippy cup nibble crackers , etc . ( we bought this our then 1.5 year old . ) we must gotten lucky , because i've never any problems wheels like some reviewers mentioned , i steer this one hand easily . seat reclines nearly all way down basket underneath useful carrying extra baby items or small shopping bags . it take two hands close , which little bit annoying . it also kind bulky even when it closed . sun visor too small much good , so i wound up throwing my baby sling over it times help block sun my little guy . ( it seemed like every travel stroller we saw this problem though . ) it very light weight easy carry when it closed . my husband carried this up down tube stations all over london ( backpack our five year old times ) he didn't any problems . we also traveled eastern europe few weeks this stroller got serious workout both city countryside . it held up really well we're still using it our second back up stroller . only bad thing sippy cup attachment came off during flight back we haven't able find replacement . also grown-up cup holder complete joke fell off after only few uses . overall though , i'm really pleased this stroller would buy it again .	1

i got this sling when my first son 1.5 months old i trying shop target . he screaming his car seat so i put it right store !!! i liked it because i could nurse him it while wearing nursing top - much easier than bjorn , nobody see what you doing . padded lip sling actually really great , it helps prop baby head up , also keeps them slipping out , which almost happened sling my cousin lent me . i am now using it my second son , sometimes i slip sling off me when he sleeping tuck it around him he stays asleep , although you make sure you place it such way ring doesn't get way or baby doesn't get tangled " tail . " i don't this all time , but it nice way get him sleep when he really hard time , because sling smells like mommy , he feels comfy . i've taken sling everywhere , my older son still likes it , even though he tad over weight limit . i didn't give it 5 stars because really tiny infants my sons not like this . now though , we use it lot around house when we don't want fiddle bjorn - great way deal separation anxiety . if you really clever , there way wear it so you older child your back . my older son likes lot !	1

(; wipes away easy enough though ! if you go babies us , you find baby einstein crayons $3.99 . nice replacement same sleeves included . colors include red , green , yellow , blue , black orange . eta : easiest way i've found clean tub after couple sessions crayon play it spray surfaces scrubbing bubbles , let it sit few moments , wipe away . there bit more elbow work required otherwise	1
this seat our 3 month old daughter who weighs 15 pounds . first , i'll point out pros this bouncer seat . music wonderful . waterfall captivating . colors mesmerizing . she sit seat 25 minutes easily . seat takes 4 d-size batteries . unlike other bouncer seats we used , there only one compartment 4 d-sized batteries . unlike its predecessor ( ocean wonder aquarium ) , rainforest bouncer keeps our child awake . if we wanted our child sleep , we'd put her bed , not bouncer . so fisher price definitely got it right this time ! a++ ! cons seat used twice before it started make this loud clicking noise bar . engineer , i took it apart noticed gears designed click ( or skip gear ) if child grab frog or monkey while it moving . this prevents gears stripped or motor overheating . however , tension this " gear skipping " behavior too sensitive such after 3 hours use , clicking occurs just friction frogs moving up down bar . i called customer support clicking they promptly sent replacement bar . after 2 weeks using new bar , it started clicking . argh ! good thing new bar it randomly . we're willing live flaw annoying clicking time time pros listed above . other con questionable . there much debate height toys bar . " infant " bouncer , it designed such child grab toys even pull rings off monkey . our daughter loves it ! we fisher price " kick play " which designed slightly older children it provides more clearance child toys ... hence " kick play . " bouncer comes one-year warranty . so year , i get replacement bars clicking becomes annoying . after replacing enough them , their engineers fix problem ? i hope so . 19 march 2007 : clicking returned replacement bar won't go away . i called fisher price replacement bar . while they really wanted send voucher $48 , i pressed toy bar sent replacement . point , customer service informed me there backlog replacements this bar till 30 april 2007 . customer service continues very friendly easy deal . we're willing wait new bar ...	1

this product really great . it inexpensive white noise maker help baby sleep . i like i plug it it runs all night . now when my son wakes night he settle himself back sleep it also helps him nap longer during day . only negative it not remember your standard settings every time you turn it . each time you turn it volume low sound ocean . also , if you power outage , battery backup kick , however , not before sound resets low volume ocean sounds . i say i think i sleep better hearing " rain " over monitor	1
i've not bought one these yet , but after seeing it person , we're definitely getting one couple months our new baby . it very small , great our 1bdr nyc apartment . people reviewed this previously don't mention incredible amount space this would save small living area . since we don't extra room our child , this perfect . seems much more sturdy than any wood portable cribs . particle board under mattress , you could very easily reinforce it board , or metal braces . you remove wheels if , later time , it worries you your toddler would standing bed . it 2 adjustable heights . seems really good me	1
model amazon sells j5933 , but there new 2007 model , l1907 . amazon doesn't sell new model apparently i don't know what differences them . i checked fisher-price website it doesn't say , but they list both models . i ordered mine amazon march 9 , 2007 . chair exactly what we looking . our dining area fairly small so using our existing dining chair save space . booster chair feels secure it secures both behind under dining chair buckle straps . it also non-skid rubber feet bottom all four corners . 3-point 5-point harness helpful keeping baby place . we using one those cheapy plastic block booster chairs our 7-month old kept slouching underneath tray . countoured seat space saver high chair helps prevent tha t.t he adjustable height useful raising tray just above our table level so we could slide whole chair underneath when not use . i'm not sure when we'd recline seat , but i guess it nice option . chair reminds me car seat , such , keeps our baby place while feeding . one-handed release tray highly adjustable settings convenient options . i don't think i could ask anything more out booster chair . perhaps built-in ipod adapter speakers built into tray or something . just kidding :	1
i bought this my new grandson my daughter told me how great it . she doesn't bundle him up constantly , just put him this he ready go . plus it keeps him nice warm we live cold climate	1
i agree other posters -- this pillow stuffing not held up like i'd expect boppy . it almost if someone besides boppy made it put boppy label it ; but design exactly what i've come expect boppy : innovative unbeliveably useful . i using this pillow since i 6 months pregnant , my baby now almost 17 months old . i just can't give it up . my husband i fight over it so much ( he loves it , too , calls it " comma pillow " ) , i'm considering getting him his own christmas ! shape provides so much back bip support , even when you're not pregnant . i honestly don't think i would gotten any sleep during my pregnancy if it hadn't this pillow , little tail ( small end pillow ) provide amazing support your lower back when you're nursing your side ( which means i able get sleep during those first few months " sleepless " nights , also ! ) my pillow came washable case , so i toss washer . pillow start separate after few months , but i've tried keep it fluffed regularly ; i think that helped it stay one piece instead separating fully into two sections . all all , i highly recommend this pillow ; but , one other poster noted , it matter personal taste -- body shape -- whether it become your favorite or deemed poor investment . i've definitely gotten my money worth , likely buy one when this one wear out -- even if i don't baby	1
i don't find too many things anymore exceed my expectations . this product one them . my son strong active . he would constantly climb out crib would land floor head first . one those occasions he go hospital because he hurt himself bad . i not know what until i went online found this product . it saved us all . i put it together myself it pretty simple best all it works . i thought my son would able break it because he strong but not case . he likes it . it keeps him he even thinks it tent play . it cozy . no more scares . zipper make alot noise i sew few spots because seam so tight it tends rip few spots . i purchased it december i am still talking it . great product	1
this chair works extremely well worth every penny . it extremely easy clean , comfortable toddler use . i would strongly recommend this potty chair every parent	1
when i ordered gym my baby 2 months old , she now 3 months old it best thing since sliced bread !! every morning she plays under it one full hour . there so much her accessories interchangable , so you add toys lower toys raise toys . it easy pack up take , so we take it when we visit relatives	1
i use mirror my front windshield , so i keep my rearview mirror road , it hasn't fallen time . i larger mirror attaches back seat , where i see my baby , she see herself . seat protector saving my leather , i've no issues all sunshades . this great value $9.99 , seat protector alone costs $13.00 . if this stuff all purchased separately , you'd pay $30 . i'm very pleased this purchase	1
i bought this my newborn granddaughter " sight unseen " . it soft , warm , works perfectly velcro closures . she also some receiving blankets but hasn't used them all swaddling because this item works so well so convenient	1
i bought one these while pregnant w/our five-day-old daughter , i never anything like it w/our first two daughters . let me just say , this one simple product renders any other blanket obsolete . it soft , pretty , cozy , easy use ( i always lousy swaddling w/regular receiving blankets ! ) , impossible get out , she loves it . i'm going out tomorrow buy five more , lol	1
i am very pleased my purchase . i 3 year old daycare 1 year old 3 year old so wanted something i could walk baby let older ones rest when needed . this works great ! it isn't hard wrists like i found most double strollers . easily steered . only things " missing " cup holder which you buy i think rubber wheels would better suited stroller especially outside strolls . but other than i am very pleased	1
i like this product so much i am taking precious daddy sleep time write this review 3:00 am what appears tail-end ( oh , god , please ) week-long , growth spurt , every 1 1/2 2 hour porky pig feeding frenzy my firstborn three week old . granted , this took few overheated bottles little practice get it right . first , we pretty . o . ' we couldn't get this thing heat consistently ( my wife doc i'm lawyer so you'd think two us we could heat up four ounces milk , but nooooo -- apparently you need phd nuclear physics accomplish this ) . after ten tries , i started get feel it , now , i don't even measure water- i just dump bunch start counting . going time produces much more consistent results than relying water measuring , which if exact precision would probably work perfectly . me , holding el porko one arm manipulating faucet water measuring flask bit rough , so again , me , just counting off ten alligators pulling bottle works great . i'd recommed company devise flask utilizes sliding mechanism slot so you get exact amount water each time excess water spilling-off . sidenote , we use chilled expressed milk avent bottles i find : 1 . leaving lid bottles makes it easier remove four ounce bottles steaming warmer ; 2 . squeezing nub ? ( bulge right below nipple tip ) avent bottle releases pressure built up heating ; 3 . swirling bottle gently after pulling it warmer good thing ; 4 . once week cleaning seems all maintenance this thing needs . i griped my mother sometimes inconsistent heat , which she laughed told me , " go boil some water , pour it cup , drop your bottle , wait 10 minutes bottle warm up , clean up mess you made , then complain me how hard you it . " point well taken . thinking it , you'd need some sort temperature probe or something monitor milk temp itself really get exact results every time . maybe they'll some doodad like time i grandkids . this warmer , avent bottles , hard-to-find gerber anti-gas relief simethicone drops made my life much , much easier ( oh yah , lots excederine coffee too ) . kid fed , burped , oh yah baby , sleeping so i am off night night . life goooood	1
i really like this warmer . its small it works fast . there little water holder attaches side unit keep water ready when you need it . just add water , put bottle wait 2-3 minutes . only problem i warmer i use water bottle room tempature so if i leave bottle entire warming time it gets too hot my baby drink . so i just take it out after 1 minute , check it my wrist it usually ready . if you taking cold bottle refridgerator warming it , you leave it full warming time 2 - 3 minutes . i highly recommend this warmer	1
i tried several types nursing pads found these far most comfortable . i never problem leakage or " fuzzies " left behind pads . i actually throw away box johnson johnson pads i bought because they so itchy fuzzy , i found thinner types pads too flimsy me . while avent pads bulky , because i am not back into my normal slim-fitting clothes yet , i haven't problem pads showing through .	1
i picked this up my local brus store . i've snack cup only going 6 yrs now umbrella stroller got this set my 3rd child new combi savvy ex stroller . stroller came soft pack accessory holder angled handles stroller but i needed more drink holders my 2 older children us adults . it worked perfectly us i didn't any problems installing clamps - more details later . very dark navy set ( pictured ) blends well my black silver stroller . this what set comes what it : 1 ) 2 clips/clamps large small crews ( used large screws fit around oval tubing my stroller ) allen wrench . i think more clips would've nice so people could use more attachments so i'm going try find long screws replace small screws i used clip my old umbrella stroller . 2 ) 3 different sized " " shaped bottle holders ( pop bottle neck ) use small size normal water bottles , medium gerber styled baby bottles wide-mouthed water bottles ( i.e. propel gatorade ) large avent style baby bottles . 3 ) big cup holder - it already assembled so we haven't problems arms popping out , other reviewers stated . it attached clips 2 sides , one where cup swivel ( why ??? i don't know ) or other where it stationary . 4 ) double-cupped snack cup connected lids swivel open . 5 ) mesh bag small ( 7 9.5 inches ) but people - i think this bag hold all attachment parts ! 6 ) 2 large " " hooks 2 small " " hooks . they look flimsy but they work . keep mind , you aren't supposed load up your stroller heavy items anyway ( so it won't tip over ) so don't expect hang your loaded cooler it ! we used both large hooks , one bag held my bjorn baby carrier other bag snacks small pint sized water bottles it . i multi-colored " " hooks manufacturer - they very sturdy swivel but they not fit tubes this stroller . note : i not seen large enough hooks aluminum oval tubes these newer strollers . so these very useful b/c basket underneath our stroller hold good amount but not enough productive day mall :-) other reviewers rated this item low what i think unwarranted reasons or high expectations after-market stroller accessory . this item not work every stroller out there . yes , big cup holder stick out bit but zoo or mall we haven't anything fall out . put some forethought into placement clamps you won't frustrated putting them . re : installation : i recommend closing your stroller first look it over possible locations clamps . then when first installing clamps , test closing your stroller before totally tightening screws . our combi , it goes right above clamps you pull closes stroller right under included accessory pack . later when our baby starts eating snacks i see possible place it right next seat frame but then front rail stroller 2 cup holders it so i think we'll really end up keeping 2 clips up top us . location it now angled yes , your attachments end up holding your drinks straight . attachment pieces octagonal shape so when you pop piece , it straight . taking piece off easy , you only need hold clamp one hand pull piece off . don't forget take these attachments off before closing stroller throwing it trunk your car b/c items may pop-off get lost or they may break . this set really worked well us price good . we set drinks whole family full day theme parks zoo ! good luck	1
i purchased this my aria twin stroller , but i ended up using it my triple jogging stroller . it works like dream , but it just didn't fit oblong tubing aria . bummer	1
this product every mother should it definitely hard part when my daughter got older . it cleans not only avent but dr. brown bottles too when placed correctly . it definitely worth money its very efficient .	1
it so simple , makes your life so much easier !!! lit close if you turn it until you find right position . also , remember not sterilize more than 4 bottles time . it just works perfectly . my baby 8 months now i've using it since she born . great	1

i worried constantly woke up dozens times each night check my son . since i purchased this , i sleep much better . it great product . i not purchase thing put it ... i just placed my large children book	1
this wonderful product . i am first time mom , neurotic , i know . but there such difference my peace mind this monitor . i highly recommend it . we three false alarms , only because our daughter very active sleeper jammed herself into corner crib , out range . even then , it worth it . i'd rather know if she her face buried crib bumper so i slide her out middle . it great , i can't say enough . i'm so glad i am kids now when there products like these available	1
i purchased this use hamper our baby girls room . bright colors flower work great her nursery . hamper it okay . top only unzips halfway so you need use two hands drop laundry . also remember it collapsable fall over if anything dropped top it	1
i actually pretty impressed this potty , just happened across amazon see what price here ( i buy it bm , wanted double check see if i overpaid ) . this child #2 . child #1 potty , but potty trained span week never even sat it ( she used training seats instead ) . child #2 , well , not so good . after few weeks unsuccessful attempts training seat , i decided get him potty . i read reviews here first , i never would bought this one . luckily , bm my first stop i ended up two these potties ( one home , one grandma ) . pros : works advertisedeasy assembly cleanupdecent battery lifeinexpensivecons : musical fanfare follows successful ' drop ' isn't foolproof , sometimes fail activate . deflection cup front little awkwardly placed , causing some collision ( i elaborate one ? :) summary:it under twenty bucks , assembles minutes , doesn't eat batteries . ok , sometimes music won't work - it not exactly high precision laser sensing toilet ( if such animal exists ) . it'll still work 90% time . i bought expensive potty child #1 , trust me - although it cost more than double price this unit , there no appreciable differences two . it easy clean , inexpensive , works advertised . i wish more kids items managed meet these simple requirements	1
friend daughter recommended this highly , so we bought it three years ago our son . it waste money . he never used it , went straight big john . three years later , my daughter delighted her hand-me-down . i don't know what tell you . it great or not ? small price , it worth trying	1
i bought bright stars play gym my family childcare business . baby loves play this gym . i love it because parts removable placed different spots accomodating baby movements . it also very easy clean	1
since i consider this expensive i gave it 4 stars ... ( i wish there 4 1/2 star rating , it better than 4 stars ) besides expense , i'm quite happy this product . there nothing else market like it ... so , we went ahead purchased it . this adjustable child toilet seat fits onto regular toilet . because toilets come different sizes/etc . there dial(near handle ) which you turn make trainer seat fit snug toilet . i found it easy place toilet plus it so easy remove . some other brands child toilet seats very difficult remove . babybjorn toilet trainer also oval shape opening ... child head won't fit through it . child might try wear it " hat " but it not go down over their head around neck . neither our son or daughter any problems using this seat/trainer . it easy them place toilet remove . our children look so much more " comfortable " sitting this toilet trainer seat instead sitting/falling into toilet when using regular/adult size toilet seat . before purchasing this i also checked out toilet trainer babybjorn website . i impressed information there . i recommend people consider purchasing toilet trainer .	1
i pleasure " test driving " this carrier store my son before we purchased literally walked out it . kickstand great innovation makes loading securing kiddo very painless . straps secure snugli very comfi . there plenty storage room take-along essentials . child seat adjustable so this model grow your little one . best all my son loved ride !! we walked all over store he laughed cooed glee . we plan use this carrier rain forests costa rica so it get true test capability . highly recommended	1

my daughter 6 months old standing since she 4 months old . evenflo classic johnny jump up her favorite thing play . it strenghtened her legs which really helped her learning crawl . jump up allows her more independent she use it any doorway crown molding . this allows her hang out watch mommy every room . jump up easy assemble very strong well safe . it made washable material easy put up take down or pack traveling . i one home one grandma house . it also very affordable . i would give it ****	1
our seven month old daughter not like her tummy so she not like crawl or attempt crawl . she loves kicking we got johnny jump up bug help her use her legs more without laying down her tummy . she loves it . she now loves sitting up kicking her legs making herself move around . since johnny jump up bug not tray it easy get her out she not come close pinching her fingers like reviews jumpers trays usually state . we very pleased quality it low price use it our future kids	1
works well us good reception throughout 2 story 3200 sq ft house . bit static few seconds once while , probably depending position receiver . it background hiss which not hard sleep . 802.11 pre-n router 5.8 ghz cordless phones also which not seem interfere	1
this first cover i've tried it great . i don't plan trying others . it leaked first time i used it because i hadn't adjusted it properly but since i check fit , no leaks !! i use cloth while home cut down costs . i don't recommend them overnight ... but if you want something affordable during day this winner	1
until we moved this packed four months . we didn't think our daughter would able stand cold wipe , so we rushed out purchased this right after she born . it used religiously up point moving . last four months she nothing but room temperature wipes hasn't complained all ! ;) yes , it wonderful wipe her little bottom warm wipe , but this isn't much needed product	1
we returned lionheart warmer got this instead . this one works much better . it actually keeps wipes warm easy use . light handy although we dont use it much . its also easy see if you running low wipes rather than get suprised when you pull out last one . if you need wipe warmer , this one buy .	1
we picked this swing over others because it bright colorful because sound speed options . we don't find motor noisy all ... fact white noise rather calming baby . it taken my son month or two get used it . i think he just noticed moblie week ago ( he 2 months ) i think he gets older play front tray he'll like it much more . good points : * familiar songs ( other baby einstein products)*speed settings really different . * seat reclines quite bit , very comfortable*front tray many options such speech , sound songs well rotation . * parent friendly easy assemble*not " graco green " rather cheerful looking . * removable tray toy great " tummy time " or carseat toy . * cheery , stimulating moblie . * noise adjustable . * good restraint . baby secure . flaws : * mobile too high up newborns . my son didn't notice it until recently , each time i tried point it out , he just looked me instead . * plastic tray sticks so tightly it takes real hard pull open it . it always gives baby jolt . * songs front tray too short i keep go up press it keep him interested . * nature sounds sound more like static than anything else , great idea , just needs clearer . if you don't mind minor flaws its great swing good price compared others	1
i bought this based great review given previous poster her colicky baby . thankfully she not wrong ! i 5 week old who fussy high need moment he born . during day he would only takes nap me carrier night he would only fall asleep bed me my husband . my arms body getting tired carrying him all day . he would never sit his bouncy seat more then 5 minutes so i hesitant purchase piece baby equipment thinking it would not help . i type this he taking his two hour nap all himself ! i put nature sound , which white noise , set swing highest level wow , i able take shower today first time since he born without someone holding him . i never wanted swing , but now i am firm believer power motion infant !	1
great product , especially when you need sterilized bottle hurry	1
i bought this my not-yet-4-month-old daughter it arrived yesterday . i put it together ease ( except short one battery i stole clock house ) . she holding her head up since birth doesn't like laying down anymore . she loved sitting this looking toys . she just now realizing her hands hers use so toys this perfect . her toes barely touch floor so she can't quite jump it . but her rate growth , she jumping few days ! reviewer mentioned placing pillow under baby feet i think i'll try tonight . said , i still wish i bought this sooner . if you thinking buying it , don't wait until your baby older . buy it sooner get your monies worth . even if baby can't reach floor , there great value toys . so far , so good . although she deeply interested this new toy trying figure out what it , i just love it ! i see many hours her enjoyment , mine watching her valuable hands free time me !	1
our 8 month old daughter loves this jumperoo - she literally bounces until she exhausted . she even tries jumping when she not jumperoo anymore . a+ product fisher price	1
this pretty much must-have infant seats , i don't know why they don't just sell them together . bases great because you secure base once seatbelt , then just pop car seat/carrier out simple little latch . it also makes switching other cars same base breeze . definitely get this	1
i disagree genie best . it close , but i like neat better . i've owned several these things ( dekor , champ , genie neat ... why so many ? all issues ... read ) . frankly , dekor champ both smelled ( " smell control " reason i want one these ) , so those two now serve garbage pails other areas our home . genie good controlling odor , but top pain use , top my genie broke after 2 months , so one bites dust . controlling odor , genie neat both best ( they both seal off bad stuff different " sealing-off " mechanisms other models just don't ) . features other reviewers commented they like genie also neat system : -put dirty diaper into clean bag every time-plunge top contain smell section off mess- change bag every few days week . ( our 16-month old daycare m-f , so we only change our two neats once week . never smell . ever . -easy replace liners . takes 30 seconds . ( no smell when changing it , either ) . plus ... -the handle/plunger neat easier use one-handed than genie . just push pull . no grappling get top off or bag grab diaper start twisting ( dirty diaper one hand squirmy baby other ) . -less plastic wasted because it pushes straight down . genie rotates plastic plastic which sends more down chute . you see , i've dumped ton money into this wisdom . but now , i finally stink-free environment my son room , so far , nothing neat broken ( i'm only afraid because it underdog , they're going discontinue it , then refills hard find ) . - if happens , i would try genie hope lid holds out . i rank genie #2 out all these models	1
this night light adorable . i just purchased this add my froggy tales collection . it lights way your little one nursery . i love this line am so glad they came out more accessories . it simple on/off switch seems durable . only improvement i would make would sensor turn off automatically during daylight hours . there also new wall light switch plate part collection , stores , not yet line	1
we using this seat saver 16 months now it not ruined our leather seats . every month i take out ( convertible ) car seat clean seat re-install safety check seats just fine . if your car seat properly installed there no way this seat saver move around . my only suggestion manufacture would make it bit more narrow ... it takes up more space actual vehicle seat than needed . two-stage version only way go	1
we bought this because my our car seat making marks all over seats my car , it get job only thing i wish it liitle taller or it went up over headres	1
there seems quite few choices lamaze animal toys babies ( hippos , giraffes , turtles , etc . ) . i chose larry lion he big hit my 3 1/2 month-old daughter . she grown , she discovered new aspects larry which keep her fascinated . his bright colors quite captivating , his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle . she also quite enjoys playing his " crinkly " mane , now she teething , i think she really appreciates chewing 2 rings purple star attached his paws . larry already our " stand-by " , fail-safe toy when all other toys fail pique her interest . thumbs-up firs t-t ime parents	1
i bought many potty seats , tried them out this one i stuck . i even tried those " folding travel " seats , but all they slip slide scare my daughter into thinking she going fall . i even bought second take diaper bag . i highly suggest this potty training buy !	1

i love this toilet training seat ! i like it hard , molded plastic , not soft seat . it looks so much nicer bathroom cleans better too . my 3 year old daughter finds it comfortable sit . adjustment knob helps keep seat place . i also like high splash guard front ... girls little fountains too , this only seat we've used keeps everything contained toilet . it well worth extra money	1
regular training seats you place top adult size toilet just not stable enough my son . add fact one our toilets oval it bad fit . also add he very big boy regular seats would allow him pee right over little pee catcher ( don't know official term ;) part ) . he'd say , " mommy - i fall " didn't want try . this seat works great because you adjust it make it fit more stability	1
we loved this product because we didn't remember whole " burrito-wrap " system . only down-side fabric stretch our little houdini figured out way out . but nothing few diaper pins wouldn't solve	1
my infant daughter loves held which hard her two year old brother wanting equal time . this sling helped so much . it same one dr. bailey grey anatomy uses ( except she wears hers upside down - don't know if intentional or not -- hmmm ...	1

very easy put together it rides wonderful our neighborhood trails . my daughter fits snugg seat unlike other strollers we tried . folds up easily , however its little awkard pick up load car .	1
this wonderful product - we got it keep cats out crib . however , zipper wakes up our son almost everytime we try open or close it . so we usually just shut his bedroom door now . maybe our next child won't so sensitive sound . update : now he little older , he isn't waking up it - long we very quietly zip it	1
my husband i over-analyze everything this highchair best we've seen . we started our son solids 4 months , which before he could sit up himself , worked flawlessly ever since . tray easily slides off , even one handed . cover easy wipe down , tray stores itself back chair , harness straps secure , when it folds , it really " space-saver " . leg separator annoying first , but we found it detachable ( foot rest well ) .	1
i recently purchased this 6 piece set , lamp , hamper mobile , our nursery . colors vibrant pastel pinstriped shades blue , sage green , tangerine touches bright yellow . i like brand new package , material touchable isn't stiff board . while this generally listed ' gender neutral ' i think buyers should know there * lot * blue this set . while doesn't matter us , i know some parents prefer more yellows , greens , oranges , etc ... true gender neutrality . embroidered details ( humpty dumpty , cow jumping over moon , etc .. ) quilt , bumper pad , diaper stacker hamper just beautiful . they stand out but not take away prettiness fabric . accessories cute but i think if i paid full price hamper lamp i would less pleased . material hamper great , but wooden structure very flimsy . i foresee this getting put inside closet once baby crawling or it easily pulled over . lamp story book hey diddle diddle ( cow , spoon , dish ) it - very cute - but up close you notice it not painted well . slight distance you don't notice it , but it bug me little considering price . mobile cute , but i not care fact baby only see bottoms stars , moon cow . not nearly exciting ones position animals/shapes down towards baby . would not my first choice mobiles ( i prefer geometric symphony one ) , but since i got this package deal i likely use it . overall : * material nice quality touchably soft*the colors embroidery beautiful*the colors lean bit more towards traditional ' boy ' room versus neutral room light blue main color bumper pad , dust ruffle , hamper valance*hamper , lamp mobile not high quality products crib seti would recommend this crib set friends family sans hamper , lamp mobile . nursery rhyme theme classic well put together here lambs ivy . i rated this 5 stars simply crib set . price amount items included it great deal . if i rating accessories i would not give them more than 3 just average	1

i used both kissaluvs size 1 2 my son , age 6 months - 2 years . he never leaked ! i never problem drying them - perhaps because i live dry climate . my husband loves them too , so they all we used . buy them new $10 each . i used 2 dozen time . my son such wiggle worm i recently bought few fuzzi bunz pocket diapers . i like them better his age ( 2-3 years ) because i don't wrestle diaper cover him . however , they pricey $15 each . i'm baby this month bought dozen size 0 - i need least dozen - but they grow out them so quickly . i heard they best infant diaper . high resale value well .	1

we baby bjorn step stool , potty chair , little potty , now toilet trainer . hind sight 20/20 . toilet trainer step stool all you need . our initial thought potty chair home little potty trips . reality our daughter would sit her potty then want sit toilet like mommy daddy . we balanced her toilet before we decided get toilet trainer . no more balancing acts toilet . she use her step stool get toilet when she wants . toilet trainer travels well , fits all types toilets , easy install , remove , clean ! potty chair little potty fantastic quality but you might well go toilet trainer start	1
i originally looking buying potty chair all bells whistles , flush noises , music , lights , works . then i thought , wait minute , regular potty doesn't those things . she wants one like mommies ! i got this her after asked repeatedly read " potty book girls " she immediately sitting it without any prompting . once i finally took her pants off she went right away . we still working going always potty , but she loves potty itself . it very basic sturdy . my daughter no problem sitting little guard front . i like it separate bowl my daughter so proud when she take it out flush it down " big " potty	1
i got these imse vimse covers my daughter . first i thought i'd like iv more , because it seemed though fit better around leg , but i changed my mind quickly . not only these fit just fine , but they much more durable ! after few washings , iv began loose shape velcro began warp ( i cold water wash line dry ) . bummis look just same when i got them ( except some stains ) . these covers last me through next few babies , i'm sure it ! my only complaint once your baby begins push weight limit it takes little practice get velcro tabs stick right . when my daughter weighed 14lbs . if i didn't fastened tabs just right spot they would come undone , but it didn't take long figure out correct . after comparing these covers others ( my iv bummis original friend mine used ) , these covers come out top ! ps - i wash covers cold water first make them last longer , but it best wash covers hot water disinfect . i started washing bummis hot water ( my diapers ) they're still holding up fine . response other review .... these diapers fold back tabs laundry . i bought these exact covers this exact page mine them	1
we started tub seat bath complete universal bath system first years , but it way too small our baby he slid around it so much we switched bathing him sink while we supported him . when he outgrew sink , we needed alternative , so we bought this bather . it lot like his bouncy seat , which he loves very comfortable . this much easier than supporting all his weight one arm bathing him other while he squirms around . i didn't give it 5 stars because i think it lacking 2 things would make it perfect . one strap like bouncy keep him sliding down , though he doesn't slide too bad ( not like tub ) , other it needs suction cups bottom hold it place tub better	1
i purchased this pillow my son i tired seeing him slumped over his car seat while he slept . restupright pillow , he secure alligned his carseat sleeps straight spine . pillow adjustable fabic really soft . also , its very easy use !! it well-made it comes straps so pillow goes over seatbelt it not slip down while he sleeps	1
i recieved this bumper shower gift i really like colors quality . only thing it doesn't come instructions how attach it your crib its not self-explanitory one might think it would . picture packaging shows pattern facing inwards towards baby , no bumper sliding side rail so i guess you double it back sides but ties end up weird way . we'll see how it works out , but otherwise its good quailty bumper	1
relatively easy hang . we used additional glue pre-pasted paper because we read elsewhere it necessary . overall relatively good product	1
awesome item right size works great	1
my thoughts this product , i hope they help you decide . i already purchased britax car seat neutral color , thinking i'd happy . wrong ! so i return neutral color went floral pattern , which i love looking so my husband ! price more than i thought " next level " should cost , but well worth it . i spent good amount time store looking/feeling other car seats . this model very durable , good feel material , it going last !!! my only disappointment velcro tabs , which great idea hold straps side allow you place your child seat . velcro tabs located inch too high .	1

we purchased britax bodyguards our children when they first came out because they first booster provide side impact protection their heads , just like more current parkway model . i same complaints others first seats impeding kids ' views , but they quickly grew accustomed seats ( i loved their heads well-supported when they fell asleep long trips ) . last week , my daughter i car accident where we blindsided right . thanks those ' wings ' around her head , she doesn't seem suffered any injuries what serious collision . i bought new parkways each kids day after accident , i wouldn't want my kids ride any other booster seat	1
seat worked great . we bought seat because we could not stand way my 3 yearolds head would hang when she went sleep car . this seat offers support sleeping children . however same neck support prevents them looking side side ease ( kind like blinders )	1
i little worried when ordering this crib because several people said they problems shipping they said they never received product . i didnt any problems shipping . i received crib withing number day stated when i ordered ( 7-14 days ) . we no trouble putting crib together . i would suggest two people put it together just because it easier if one person hold parts crib while other person screws it together . it looks very nice . i no complaints .	1
my baby boy hates eat . 7 months old , he only taking most 4 oz milk per feeding . we tried all kinds nipples bottles . i picked up these bottles right when i got home , he ate 8 oz . one feeding . since then , he still doesn't like eat , but least we get some milk his little belly .	1
my son born nine weeks early trouble when nicu started bottle feeding him . hospital bottles either fed too fast or required too much sucking him . once we got him home we bought every bottle we could find try . dr. brown third one we tried it worked fantastic him . nipples fed him slow but not require too much effort him . once we started him this bottle , he started eating exactly he should not problem since . we also use nutramigen formula which also helped gas reflux , but us it nipple ease use him . downside us they don't fit well our dishwasher so we hand wash all them . when we go out we put dry formula each bottle carry bottled water us . when we need mix bottle we take out inside pieces , put cap screw neck nipple back , shake it well replace inside we no problem shaking - just take out inside piece .	1
my monitor excellent others reviewed , but careful ceiling fans ! when my fan sensor detecting movement when it shouldn't ( baby not crib ) . if you fan movement detection inaccurate . sure test this under all circumstances ( when you something room vibrates/moves , etc ... )	1

i ordered essentials bag after struggling bulky regular diaper bag my newborn . essentials bag fits blanket laying baby change , new outfit , least two diapers , wipes case , three 6 oz . bottles , formula dispenser , my wallet , keys , pacifer , burp cloth , cell phone . everything it ones compartment , which makes finding everything easy , no digging around middle big bag , due design it feels much lighter than larger bag . i not issues seams coming apart either . i also recommend bundle me , jj cole , it makes winter travel babies so much easier than snow suit	1
size shape , this bag holds more than you would think ! i also love your hands free when you wear it your cell phone easily accessible . we bought it our first plane trip our 3 month old used it back home more than our other bags . my only complaint there isn't pocket big enough hold fold-up changing pad ... but i fit disposable ones	1
overall , i've very impressed so far this nursery collection . specifically , i like quality quilting work -- which , honest , i wasn't expecting after just viewing web picture . since we live warm climate , i decided use comforter wall hanging above crib . it looks very lovely , brightens up room , shows off all embroidery comforter . anyway ... whether you use this quilt blanket or art , i think you get your money worth	1

... i plowed relentlessly thru virtually all cards original set . we even considered making our own playing cards , so satisfying game . so we all thrilled discover there electronic version . ' catch phrase'is fast paced , easy learn play , game setup , discrete categories , while not my personal liking , offers bit variation . only glytch scoring feature , which not allow mistakes , but this small quirk . ..	1
i quite skeptical when this small strap arrived mail because it looked so simple . but it worked very well real life-saver . it affordable easy use . i recently traveled alone my 13-month old didn't want bring my stroller . i simply used traveling toddler attach our britax marathon car seat my carry-on suitcase . it allowed me " wheel " my son through airport myself , while carrying all stuff i needed carry . i backpack diaper bag , i good go ! so simple i even hand free . i couldn't believe it . flight attendant helped seat once i plane . only drawback going through security un-do then re-do everything . but once you straps adjusted right tightness , it easy put back without readjust straps .	1
we purchased this travel over summer it great ! i researched many options , not only this most economical , it easiest most efficient . it very easy quick use very small store when not use . plus , my daughter loved it because it allowed her travel her own seat where she very comfortable . not only we love it , i three different people stop me dfw denver international airports asking where i got it because they wanted one too	1
this carseat absolute best . i purchased this seat when my daughter outgrew her infant seat my only regret i didn't buy this seat very beginning . it comfortable easy use . i looked other britax models but didn't find those easy use . yourself favor invest this seat	1
after searching just right seat , i'm happy say i love this one . instalition so easy . i acura i afraid it wouldn't fit well into car rear facing , but it fits very well . room spare . i would highly recomend this seat .	1
i really like suction bowls . different sizes lids great . my only complaint bowls often come un stuck so every few minutes you reach over push them back down	1
after potty seat you take off toilet , we finally tried this potty pal seat . my almost 4yr old daughter easily take proper seat down go bathroom . childs adult seat light not come slamming down . they all fit seat cover nicely not akward adult use . highly recommend wish i would bought this after she outgrew stand alone potty seat	1

this entertained my daughter 2 hours day . make sure buy extra hanging toys . it comes 3 hanging toys . musical toy , bell ringing mirror rattler your childs starter kit . it my daughter reaching rolling first time plus focusing great . colors characters her talking kissing them	1
gymini wonderful ! i used it since day i brought my son home hospital . it helps baby develop focus tracking skills increases alertness first couple months . it then helps hand eye coordination . you dangle assortment toys arches . we never purchased any extra ones you get because i'd just add some his other toys clip-ons you'd use stroller . it hard find educational toy newborn interactive well last ! this fits bill . you lie floor talk them what they looking .. sometimes my baby just happy his playtime play independantly 20-30 minutes . it portable . we folded it up taken it suitcase us 5 times now ! because it so lightweight folds up easily it great travelling . then you set it up your hotel room or grandma house baby familiar environment play which gives you some hands free time baby some fun well . it amazed me how much older children play it ! thanksgiving christmas grandma all nieces/nephews ages 4 14 playing it their own baby . now 4 months i think my son gets little bored it because he likes sitting up . yet he still play it good 15 minutes ( it may not seem like much but trust me this , if you want enjoy nice cup coffee/tea morning while it still hot this good thing ! ) . i tend rotate his toys now so i think this still bring entertainment up year . toddlers we over like crawl under arches past dangling toys ..	1
my 2 year old loved this cup , before he wouldnt drink out sippee cup only prober glass but would alway spill it . this cup so bright he cant help but look items tell me whos it , it helps also bright i never lose it . i hope this cup last over used his brother . wide top makes it feel different than reg cup . i am buying more oif these	1
started using when he 5.5 mos sitting help . wrap-around-belt secures baby even helped him sit up cart kept him secure sliding or tilting ! now it even more useful 7 mos he reaches everything . wide strap really holds baby secure keeps them leaning over grabbing things . i hook toys strap ' links ' his pacifier clip he good-to-go even hour+ store . i liked look " other " kind covers whole basket - but this one less bulky wide strap keeping him where i want him ! update 1yr age : i ended up buying one other types cart-protectors . other one great until few months ago , when baby just can't kept still cart leans or pulls feet up . so other kind became easier he never hits his head any part cart also it used restaurant high-chairs	1
this our third baby monitor . we bought this one backup grandma house we ended up liking it so much better than ones we bought double ( quadruple ) price ! night light wonderful sound good .	1
i've using this pump every day 4 months , i'm absolutely satisfied it . since my son premature i pump exclusively beginning , i say without reservation this pump works just well , quickly , hospital pump . it empties my breasts 10 minutes , it easy , it travels well . also certain bras ( not medela bras , they seem require some type adapter ) you pump hands free simply hooking/securing nursing bra cups over breast pump cups . one last comment i make which speaks quality , i ordered extra membranes tubing available " just case , " but yet need them original ones still operational . i - - recommend this pump all nursing moms , if you think this one expensive , consider two things : 1 . value your time convenience , 2 . total cost after you end up replacing cheaper one when you find it doesn't really meet your expectations or breaks down	1
i bought gerber comforthold bottles playtex ventair natural shape bottles , there stage ones . my son didnt like gerber nipples since nipples too short he hardly get any thing . i end up buying more playtex bottles threw away gerber nipples use playtex nipples gerber bottles well since they fit gerber bottles . thing i like these bottles , obviously he got less air after feeding him i didnt burp him like i used other bottles . shape bottles easy hold me my baby well . no leaks recommended !!!	1
calvin tried 6 other bottle systems - including dr. browns , drop-ins latex nipple only one he accepted . introducing bottle tough breast-fed babies , this one seemed more natural than others . i can't stop bzzing how good they . hope this helps you your bottle selection , amyco	1
wonderful bottle breast or bottle fed babies . my first daughter likes these bottled fed only . my second daughter only liked these , if it wasn't mommy ( if ya know what i mean ) . you find generic liners work fit just well , cut back cost . bonus there less clean up . just wash nipple nipple ring your ready go you next feeding	1
my son little so it may not good larger kids starting potty train . he 27 pounds age 21 months . get some those disinfectant wipes clean it out each time you're good . ( wear gloves wash your hands after too . ) fits small space my small bathroom without issue	1
i love this little potty car trips . my 3 year old petrified automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair use recent vacation . she loves it . it really easy clean . i just keep some clorox wipes car seat . it now lives back my minivan incase emergency potty stop . we also using second one train our 23 month old son . splash guard great he very comfortable seat	1
i think overall this booster great . it lightweight large enough accommodate children they grow . my 3 year old son ( 30lbs ) looks kind tiny inside seat he slouch seat , but seatbelt position good height small children . this seat would well child who easily goes remains seat ... but not child who likes climb out their seat	1
these wonderful ! my baby getting uncomfortable swaddled three months , so we decided make switch sleep sacks . we worried her arms free she might hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this true first so we started only putting her these during daytime - light cotton one . after week she not waking early her naps anymore after two weeks we tried her it night - she slept straight through night ( she when she swaddled ) . so transition painless she seemed much happier baby able reach her hands move her arms . while i didn't notice shrinkage i notice zipper bunch up bit , but this hasn't problem . sometimes my daughter sucks it if it gets close her mouth , but she reach it - it doesn't cover her face all or trap air she could rebreathe . i didn't like these don't sleeves so i tried carter sleep sacks found sleeves too short hard get my daughter . those sacks only come one size which my daughter already outgrown four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she also outgrown small size sleep sack , but medium size fits her perfectly some room grow . i didn't want use fleece first since it polyester . i wanted use cotton . but we've found she sleeps longer seems prefer he heavier fabric fleece one . also , we only bought these blue even though we girl because color calming our easily overstimulated baby . we've washed these many times they look just good hold together just well they originally . we've also found you put your baby into next larger size without it so big they get their arms out or it bunches up around their face . so after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks day one	1
no probs this picking up neighbors or interfering our existing fp 900 mhz monitor our 2 1/2 year old . we trash safety first cheaper one invest this , but it worth it we really like it . it clear , we also like it comes two receivers . much easier , even our smaller home .	1

i love this little pouch . what great idea rather than going though your whole diaper bag looking pacifier . great thing this pacifier pod feel this little bad ( since it connected outside diaper bag ) you tell if you pacifier it so you don't leave home without one end up needing buy	1
gummie rail guard good investment . my daughters crib larger sides which regular crib guards wouldn't fit . gummie guards fit any size . only problem i found tape which holds them isn't tacky enough . don't get me wrong ... they work but my daughter found edge started lifting off crib . i some left over put new piece she hasn't bothered it . maybe i didn't put it correctly first time ? gummie saved my daughter crib her teeth	1
i bought this system after experiencing frustration other wireless monitors . some reason this unit worked well even though i wireless computer network portable phone . flexibility excellent since both monitor cameras work re-chargeable power pack , batteries ( monitor ) or ac power ( camera . ) because it worked so well we decided import resell them .	1
i am really impressed potty protectors . first all , they came quite quickly . secondly , size pretty generous , so it fits larger toilets . i feel better my little one using public toilets now .	1
we bought this mattress my daughter 3 years ago when she 6 months old , it now her toddler bed ! it survived uncountable jumping sessions so easy clean - literally just soapy spongeing job . it finally got tiny split vinyl cover , but i put two inch piece duct tape over it , put sheet it back business ! when we replace it , we'll just get pediatric 1000 . excellent value	1

i think i practically wore this every day first 6 months my child life . it awesome ! it great sit up bed feed because it gives you back support . child feels very supported well . cover very easy wash . i used it photo prop well help her sit up when she older . my only complaint i not invent it	1

i like this seat ! it last till my son out car seat . it hard buckle ( cars seat belt)with boster seat still attached , but when you take it off it works just like all others . i no complant except it hard buckle car cars seat belts . i haven't tried teather system	1
i love this stroller ! i bought cheaper umbrella stroller it not near stroller this . handles comfortable height my son sits comfortably stroller . basket perfect diaper bag couple shopping bags . i highly recommend this stroller . it great investment worth money	1
angle rear wheels handles make walking comfortable if you're taller parent ( unlike really cheap umbrella strollers ) . it folds up very small , so it easy throw floor back seat if you don't trunk space available . it also nice carrying strap so you throw it over your shoulder like gym bag , which nice when i walked my office day care several blocks away . i always recommend this my friends ease use good value	1
my first breastfed baby these my salvation . it helped relieve soreness while breast bra . it keeps sore nipple suspended midair off rubbing your bra . it also helps nipple stick out little , which i found made attachment ( baby mouth nipple)easier first time breast-feeder . you need check shield now then dump out any milk ( or some may save it ) . only way i see product could improve area , would bottle size attachment your boob whom us would really want walk around ? there holes top shield allow air circulation . me esp . night i would put nursing pad over holes so it would help soak up any leakage . but far this product worth it . i'm due soon baby #2 am back buy more . i gave mine mom friend who ready give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all time her breasts unbearably sore . she swears these shields reason she didn't give up extremely grateful . definitely worth try	1
okay , so canopy . well it touching my sons head , however there natural bend metal holds canopy up ( slides through canopy like curtain rod)(where it connects stroller)and i took it out put it though other way my son like 2 inches his head canopy . other people or this problem , this easy fix . i hope some people who already left reveiws come back read this . i give it 4 stars now instead 3 my other reveiw . my other reveiw labeled kamarina	1
this great product tight fitting lids . it also dishwasher safe microwaveable . this vendor also ships apo addresses - thank you .	1

i 19 month old daughter one due august , so i look out double stroller i actually liked . when we saw quattro duo we couldn't wait it come out . we waited it hit shelves which not happen around here yet . so we nervously ordered it online without test drive . our nerves settled when we recieved it other day . yes it heavy , but i manage fine . it longer than picture but if it any shorter you could not fit 2 children it . this stroller too many nice features dwell small negatives . best part besides easy fold down it fits easily room into my car ( i mazda 6 ) . this big worry , but not anymore . i love this stroller very happy purchase	1
after receiving no help babies us trying order this , we decided go ahead purchase this without even touching it . it made me nervous , but after reading everyone reviews , i figured , lets give it shot . wow , love this stroller ! i am still working putting infant seat out , but far menoovering this , it great . i son who almost 3 loved it so much he wanted pushed his bedroom it , this thing went around corners no problems without even bumping walls . now , i know purpose not use it house , but after reading review this hard steer i make sure i put this comment here . this stroller so much more attractive than old duo gliders ' , i feel like hip mom	1
i received my graco quattro tour stroller last week after waiting over month it released . it so worth wait ! this stroller so easy steer both kids plenty leg room ! there large storage basket underneath plenty cupholders . it pushes like dream , even my 2 boys who over 30 lbs each ! i owned duo gliders past they so much bulkier than this so hard steer . i highly recommend this stroller . note , i very pleased service i received amazon.com!	1

we swaddled our daughter until she 6 months old . this blanket not work very small babies , but we started using it around 2 months . it wonderful . only problem we it when our daughter strong enough , she could break out it . point we switched miracle blanket ( which really works like straight jacket .. there no escaping ) . our daughter now seven months old sleeps unswaddled . she slept through night ( 12 hours ) since two months age , i really believe she such good sleeper because swaddling	1
lost neice sids , i very nervous my baby would stop breathing night . this co-sleeper got me through first 5 months because i could reach over check her breathing any time during night . i could sleep or nap right next her without fear rolling her . she would not sleep it until she 3 weeks old , but after , she just fine . i would definitely use it again if i more children	1
my daughters preemies so i very concerned spaces crib . this product worked very well so far i'm happy i purchased it .	1
after waking serious screaming nursery find her six month old caught her leg crib rails my daughter i searched solution problem . thanks reviews other parents who experienced similar problems we found crib shield system . it works perfectly . although baby emma tries she not repeat entanglement . so now she bigger better things . crib shield system would make great gift exspecting parents . one less thing worry . one you probably never even though ; but baby	1
swaddleme awesome product if your baby enjoys swaddled . our baby slept best when swaddled , but could often work his arms out blankets we swaddled him . we found he stayed swaddled longer , thus slept longer , when he his swaddleme . i gave my sister one when she baby , she loved it so much , she ordered two more . i couldn't find local store sold large ( when he outgrew small one ) , thus ordered it amazon .	1
advanced pump works just well symphony pump we used hospital . i would definitely recommend this product . it very helpful	1
i like convenience able carry this pump me i like it comes pump/freeze/serve bottles separate carrying case cooler block . plus , bag good-looking you wouldn't even know it breast pump . pump itself works well . what i not thrilled bottles didn't come nipples medela nipples not easy find their own . i buy separate pump store starter kit ( 4 bottles , caps , nipples ) get decent supply . also , pump little louder than i thought it would but if you zip pump compartment while you're pumping , it cut down noise . thing i expected there different speeds pumping like there ameda hospital pump i rented couple weeks but even $319 , it only one speed ( although you adjust vacuum strength ) . last , this isn't directed specifically this pump but all pumps pump both breasts simultaneously ... i don't think they're worth it . i don't really even pump both breasts same time anymore because it not easy sit there holding both cups over both breasts top adjusting dials possibly holding or trying soothe baby . i constantly broke suction seals dripped milk my lap . i spent so much time readjusting cups trying get comfortable i could just pumped one breast time ( which i now ) . fortunately , medela pump works pretty fast magic me .	1
i using my brest friend pillow three months i love it ! it so secure never slips or slides like boppy pillow or traditional pillows . cover comes off machine washed , but hang dry , which annoying , but still not enough me take star away . mbf also nice firm , which i find big advantage over boppy . i cannot recommend this pillow enough-i buying it all my friends who plan breast feed	1
going lugging around heavy infant carrier convenience pulling this out car pushing down lever bring out wheels glorious transition . it not best carseat out there , tad inconvenient some areas , but ease converting it stroller taking my little girl into stores it , far outweigh other annoyances . one thing i say - when carseat rear-facing position , it tilt forward bit my liking . when my girl falls asleep her head usually hanging forward because forward slan t.t he seatbelt go over top seat , so you reattach everything every time you put your baby into it get little annoying . stroller part great though . it so easy adjust tightness straps . despite small wheels , it actually very smooth ride concrete bumpy parking lots . much smoother then any shopping cart her carseat it , ever - lol . i got this gift my mom didn't think i'd like it , but i really love it now .	1
i must say this really good car seat/stroller . we needed it long trip europe oklahoma . it made it sooo much easier . then when we got states it great ride airport then other cars we use . we waiting our other car seats when began love it even more . we able go car mall , church , movie , store what ever ease . only thing we didn't like it didn't umbrella or something protect shade it isn't suitable rough areas like gravel or large brick areas . it tends move funny around those kinds areas other than it great	1
this stroller worth every penny . pivot wheel fantastic . i friends their jog stollers stationary wheel they struggle turn it when we're out walks . this one so smooth manuverable . i think best feature sunshade . it so much bigger than all other strollers . it really great job keeping sun off my baby skin . 2 wishes : i wish it tray baby keep cheerios sippy cup i wish it reclined more	1
i purchased this my daughter when she out grew her baby tub . i didn't like plastic rings because if she fell back she would get hurt . this very soft ring . it definately kids sit up their own . i other friends use this they loved it enough they also purchased one . it also comes nice hanger hang it towel bar bath tub -- i didn't find it too heavy hang	1
this thing awesome . we even took it restaurant us before my child could sit up his own . we didn't want leave him car seat hour because ( 1)he would get restless ( 2 ) babies get flat spots backs their heads frequent pressures car seats/swings . bumbo allows you sit your child ( if they unable or unstable sitting their own ) front you so you face them interact them without support them . we took our child baby class all babies one these . it really helped free up parents ' hands so they could play children versus holding them up . someone really thinking when they made this product . get it . don't think twice . you won't regret it .	1
this our first baby monitor , so i can't compare it against others , but we love it . it very quiet ( when baby asleep ) . there very little static or interference . we haven't ever picked up any other conversation . i haven't able figure out what frequency broadcasts . box instructions never say . some others mentioned , led ( lights ) indicators nice . if i'm shower i watch monitor see if baby making noise even if i can't hear it . also , we no problem reception anywhere house . our house 2500 sq . ft one story just comparison	1
we don't large bedroom , so mini works great ! i love our baby right next us , i'm right there if he needs me , i feel quite secure using it . it also quite small which makes easy travel when we go overnight trip somewhere . it definately worth it	1
my baby small ( 4 pounds 14 ounces ) when born not able nurse well . i established my supply rental symphony hospital . when it came time return symphony i debated whether continue renting it or purchase my own pump . purchase price pumps really scared me off , but i considered swing because it intended daily use , which what i needed , but not pricey pump style . i love swing . swing efficient , if not more , symphony . fact it single pump not bother me all because it so efficient i am pumping 20 minutes - both sides . it so lightweight portable you go anywhere . after month tied huge symphony every three hours , it wonderful welcome change able go places pump . i am full time working mom currently use swing every day . i fully recommend this	1
ok ... so i've told symphony cadillac breast pumps ... but price tag $[ ... ] who afford ?? renting it cost $[ ... ] month if you find place rent it .. i used it month .. i honestly not totally impressed price . then i read up swing this pump also ( like symphony ) includes medela 2-phase expression technology - new standard unsurpassed naturalness , comfort efficiency . after buying it .. i liked it better then symphony . infact i think it works just exact same , which crazy medela when price so different . i tried medela pump style well avant isis this one best . i would highly reccommend this pump . positives : this pump portable . comes travel bag , runs batteries or you plug it . pump itself size hardees hamburger . breast shield soft very effective , you control speed it letdown mode well automatically turns after few minutes . breast shield soft comfortable , suction speed same symphony , pump simple use , four buttons-you can't not figure it out easily ! it fast emptys your breast totally . negatives : ( i stretch this one cause i love pump ) it not quiet , i don't know why other review says it .. it actually louder then i thought it should .. but not louder then medela pump style or symphony . but just not " quiet " i don't want you thinking you going get something you pump front mini van noone back going hear .. it single pump ... i know .. duh .. but it negative , if only they made double this size base , i'm almost tempted buy . i highly reccommend this pump , mom three , i've tried lot pumps .. i think medela selling this pump short saying it like pump style , i think it comparable symphony !	1
i use my avent isis manual breastpump 3-5 times day it works pretty well , but white valve " star " got worn out after 2 months use . when buying this pump make sure you buy extra white valves " stars " spare parts , they not expensive , its 1.25 british sterling pounds per piece . make sure you buy 10 if you planning using this pump year or more	1
unlike some cheaper plastic stools , this one hold mom or dad ! it may not look like much online , but when you see feel it person , you realize it really much nicer than $5 stools you find discount stores	1
no more dirty tables my 11-month old eat off . it keeps her food table even piece catches food not end up her mouth . suction cups help hold it plac	1
this sleepsack perfect . i little skeptical , didn't know whether buy cotton one or this one . i am very happy quilted one . it fairly light cotton fabric , quilting stitched into it . it extremely soft seems awesome quality . after washing , it holds up wonderfully . my daughter not arrived yet , but expected any day now . i feel good putting her sleep this blanket help keep sids epidemic down .	1
i 2 change pad covers . this munchkin . it world difference so soft fluffy this cover . though we washing this cover every other week ( my baby 3 mo old now ) , it still feels looks like new .	1
this thing great . we use it safely co-sleep ( you safely co-sleep ; why most doctors this country refuse even discuss it when it reduces risk sids beyond me ) . it works so well , you just pull baby down little pad she sleeps , nurse her till she falls asleep lying down , then pull pad back up into sleep nest , without waking her . so helpful !! i really recommend this those thinking co-sleeping . it definitely safer alternative than adult mattress/pillows/blankets . we put it us sides keep pillows getting near her face- perfect .	1
excellent shopping experience all aspects . great item excellentshipping . very pleased . thanks	1

i lived cold climates each my kids , hated dreaded bundle up squeeze into carseat routine . it makes traveling so much easier now i leave baby without big bunting know she'll warm cozy . zippers great - almost 6 months use every single day not problem . i washed it several times it looks like new held up wonderfully . i used it windy days , when i bit sceptical it windproof , it stood test . moving it carseat stroller sinch velcro closures back . i don't any cons list this such great item us	1
we ordered this crib on-line babies " " us/amazon we like it lot ! not only it arrived one week earlier than estimated arrival time but it also came very good condition . i read reviews before we ordered crib realized we taking risk quite few customers complaining problems trasportation or serious damages due poor packaging . our crib arrived almost perfect condition . only reason i not give it 5 star rating because one piece we're going need when we convert toddler bed chip it ; it not too bad though . also , assembling crib not problem all my husband one our friends . following instructions , they able assemble 1 1/2 hour . i said before , we're very satisfied our selection , now we're just waiting our baby girl ( due march 21 , 2006 ) see how she likes it .	1
i purchased several diaper bags received several my shower . person who loves pocketbooks , i'm horribly picky any bag . but diaper bag especially should functional stylish . combi urban sling just . time this writing , i've only it week , so i can't speak it durability . what you can't see pictures this site many pockets bag . front flap closes messenger-style via velcro . there zipped pocket which spans width front flap inside front flap . upon opening front flap velcro , there two pen holders two compartments/pockets which fit wallet , or checkbook or even diapers if that where you want put them . there zipped compartment side bag which holds one bottle . this only drawback ; only one bottle go insulated compartment . however , part bag which deepest , there two deep compartments one zippered compartment top spacious inside . bottle thing remedied me putting bottle inside compartment ziploc bag ( keep temperature ) . shoulder heavily padded middle bag , which joy my shoulders . key holding section convenient well . back bag compartment which holds large changing pad . this one best features changing pad itself isn't bulky taking up oo gobs diaper bag space . i took this bag hardest possible test site : suburban mall . this his first trip there i able pack two nine ounce bottles , wipes , diapers , change clothes , his medicines , disposable changing pads , receiving blankie ( albeit thin ) , my wallet essentials still pockets bag empty . rubberized shoulder pad i didn't worry bag falling off my shoulder it rubbed against my shirt . ( i know i'm not only one who sick readjusting bags their shoulder over over ) . way it designed , it leaned flat my hip instead jutting out . made turning those store corners stroller much less difficult . bag came super handy his doctor visit yesterday middle heavy rain . material seems waterproof . i really love this bag . i'm maternity leave now , i am using it strictly baby . however , someone who works social services often meetings field neighborhoods , i see using this bag transitioning work upon my return . if it holds up , it also seems perfect bag those theme park trips . overall it money well spent .	1
i purchased twilight turtle christmas gift my 27 month old grandson he says " i like it ! " . he asks it every single night bedtime . his favorite color amber , which almost impossible see , but he likes hold turtle aim stars his pj wall behind his bed - so it works him . while he not use toy it meant used ( sitting dresser so ceiling/wall illuminated ) prefers hold onto turtle aim it like flashlight , he really enjoys it , that whole point !	1
my 2 year old loves this turtle ! i can't wait show her constellations ! only thing i not like amber colored bulb ... stars aren't quite bright enough	1
i bought this video monitor system right after we moved into new house when my son ( autism ) 4 . because his bedroom different floor , i repeatedly going check him night make sure he okay still his room ! i mounted camera widest possible angle -- near ceiling corner his room -- now i check him all night long . ( i leave volume very low , so i hear if he yells , but he doesn't wake me up if he just playing or drawing . ) parents autistic kids know , our little ones often very clever escape artists , so reassurance this monitor offers fabulous .	1
i've used these two babies now used milk after 6mo deep freeze . they great most time . i freeze 10-12oz each bag ( yes , they say no more than 6oz , it myth ) . 12 maximum i found tho . trick make sure there no air . it won't leak b/c bag expand , unlike plastic storage containers . i use straight edge table , push milk all way top zip it i push air out . don't worry if little leaks out b/c it double zipper . then i freeze it flat surface singly . after it frozen , i put 8-10 these big gallon zip lock bag date outside put it deep freezer . it easier organize them this way deep freeze . bad thing these bags once frozen , plastic nicks easily if you drop it , scrape it against something , etc ( all frozen containers ) . lansinoh really bad problem leakage before but they've improved . just thaw bag container case it leaks . lansinoh customer service great replace them if you encounter leaky bags	1

my experience , using bib without pocket pretty useless . my daughter always makes big mess when eating pocket mandatory . i love this one because it soft enough comfortable pocket actually firm enough large enough what it needs . i love entire thing hard plastic , without any fabric -- all you wipe go . no staining or mildewing or anything like . we 2 , one use one spare that all we need . mechanism clasping very easy hook unhook ( mom or dad ) , but secure enough your little one won't easily pull it off . it also adjustable little necks bigger necks alike . we've used several types pocketed bibs past , but now we've found this one we never need kind . my opinion , this perfect bib messy little eaters	1
always where it needs , durable , easy clean . my daughter used it part five-tiered food buffering system : plate , tray , bib , hands , cheeks , all which seemed vital somehow . if anything , she probably liked it better than we , we liked it lot . it always bit letdown get out somewhere realize we only one terry or soft vinyl kind	1
my first son took breastfeeding like champ get-go . i never experienced sore nipples him . my second son whole different story though . some reason my second son just didn't want open his mouth wide enough get good latch , so made excruciatingly sore nipples me first two weeks nursing . it torture - pure torture . nurse hospital gave me these gel patches help my sore nipples i must say , i don't know what i would out them ( i probably would given up breastfeeding ) . i tried nipple cream help bit , but these gel patches really what made breastfeeding manageable me . i healed faster wearing them than i nipple cream . if you put patches fridge couple minutes then put them they feel really great . this wonderful product i attribute them getting over huge breastfeeding hurtle first two weeks .	1
this baby monitor working very well us . i looked long time imho simple features ) three units - 1 each mom , baby dadb ) ability talk each them . connection good , very faint noise , if you crank up volume . downsides : little annoying loud beep you hear before speaking . rechargable battery ( two parents units ) don't hold very long . after couple months use , we recharge them now every three days - we use them 4 hours day . baby unit no battery , but i don't think that problem . still , best monitor i could find :	1
this seat so easy put together , place vehicle strap child , it definitely worth every penny . safety ratings this seat great . it also convenient , when child old enough move booster without backrest , backrest removable . our daughter loves cupholders snacks drinks . she also loves she climb out seat herself , which good her self-confidence she grows up . we use this seat 2 cars it easily removed replaced simple slide seat belt . seat even color-coded show where belt should placed across shoulder waist . definitely great product	1
we could not asked better high chair than this one . we small house not lot room kitchen area so this perfect us . it attaches great one our kitchen table chairs . i love fact it reclines too . my son hold his own bottle so i recline him after he eats his food then give him his bottle while i get things . i totally recommend this high chair everyone .	1
this excellent lightweight stroller one we use most often . we more expensive , larger , " safer " stroller more features , but we found we never use it always use this one . collapsing stroller pop into car breeze , there adequate shoulder strap you carry stroller when you doing portage over rough ground . we take stroller everywhere . we've used it well-groomed trails hiking , museums , restaurants , we've even used it beach , we've used it paris metro . this great stroller train subway travel . wheels lock feature which allows them rotate , or swivel , rear wheels brake mechanism which little awkward release , but i find comforting rather than frustrating : i want solid brakes . there small basket back stroller baby bag , purse , few groceries , so this again excellent stroller when you just running out few things or going small picnic . if i apartment dweller city , this stroller i'd ge t.t he only bad feature : this not stroller you run ! don't even try . harness excellent , but takes time adjust it correctly so it not too snug nor too loose . this super lightweight stroller , but quality product excellent engineering design . it not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways just maclaren name it : this real deal . we used it two kids , still works like new . we should get sales rep compensation , because no one really these paris all our friends saw ours got one too	1
they came very quickly what i expected . thank you seller	1

we bought this our daughter when she approximately 5 months old . she now 3 sleeping it every night since then . whenever she upset something she gets her lamby cuddles it until she feels better . we always take it trips us she hugs it car . it sewn eyes so we don't worry choking hazards . warning : when she very young my daughter got her fingers caught under twisted ribbon around lamb neck . we two back up fluffles cut ribbons off all them .	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked like charm ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1

this second car seat carrier we've owned but first one wheels . wheels make such difference when you're traveling kids ! both our car seats fit ( we took lighter two ) little extra room coats , toys , etc . bag held up well our first trip it easy use . i only wish it 4 wheels instead 2 , but you can't beat this one price	1
it worthy me purchase this item my daughter stay so clean while going shopping . :	1
this great shopping cart cover ! cost little more than other covers but definately worth extra money . it covers every part cart your baby touch . i am even able use it over restaurant high chairs ( not perfect fit - but covers everything ) . there little loops hook toys into front inside side pockets stash snacks or whatever ( i hide my wallet there while shopping sometimes ) . it bit large when folded ( big fit diaper bag if you more than few diapers it ) , but due nice soft durable fabric . it comes plastic carrying case handle ( i'm guessing it 12 " x8 " 2 " thick - i leave mine car ) . i just wish i would found this sooner - my daughter loves it too . would great gift baby shower	1

i'm not sure what other reviewer talking - we used this my daughter all fall , winter spring , her seatbelt laid just fine - there no difference all . it velcros around seatbelts , so i'm not sure what nurses talking . other than , this thing wonderful ! my daughter summer baby , so we usually just used receiving blankets . but we got this fall able use it all winter into spring . it kept her warm enough , even cold days . i would probably suggest getting heavier version newborns winter , but this worked great our older baby winter . there no need worry blankets or extra layers clothes or snowsuits . bundle me lite stays attached carseat , all you need zip it up , you're ready go ! it detaches very easily ( because it just velcro ) washed . it actually acted protective barrier carseat those " accidents . " we still washed carseat these situations , but it greatly minimized damage ! this fabulous " extra " carseat , we'll definitely using it again next baby	1
i bought one these my daughter . i it car seat when we left hospital . nurses made me take it out . they wouldn't let her leave hospital it . they said it wasn't safe use . they said it doesn't allow seatbelt straps lay properly over baby shoulders making it unsafe . i wish i would known this before i bought it .	1
i love this humidifier because it lasts long . my brother already through his 3rd humidifier 4 years while i've only this unit 4 years it more years ahead . also , i find volume low setting very soothing helps me fall asleep . i've read posts mention filters hard find . however , they very easy find . evenflo filter same exact filter holmes hwf62 filter which available many places since holmes still manufactures humidifiers which require this filter . i just purchased " colorcheck " holmes filter walmart i still original evenflo branded filter last year . i put them up each other they same exact dimensions . actually , i prefer colorcheck over original evenflo filter because i think it lasts longer before needing replacement . if you look bottom evenflo humidifier box , it say this humidifier manufactored holmes evenflo . therefore , it would only make sense holmes filter would compatible this unit	1

okay , day we arrived home hospital we put her this seat she slept hours , she loves this chair . downside this chair it cost 50+ dollars begin , then you replace batteries once week , 3 batteries ( which isn't cheap) ! we spent well over 15 dollars batteries 2 weeks we home , we only turn chair when she fussy , it doesn't run all time . but , if you afford run out get batteries every 4 days or so , this chair awesome . it very soft , she loves it . i am not sure what we would without it	1

i nurse my daughter , but she supplements formula takes pacifier too . lactation consultant suggested soothie products improve my daughter latch because long round nipple shape that more natural nursing babies . it too soon see if it made difference , but my daughter loves soothie bottles paci now ! it took weeks before she'd take mam over week before she'd successfully drink gerber bottle , but she took soothies instantly 5 mins or less prefered them products she'd using months ! they're so much easier her suck hold her mouth . price great too , 1/2 price same set avent products . my 2 complaints : 1 ) leaking bottles 2 ) pacifier looks weird doesn't attach pacifier keeper . leaking fixed getting part where rim bottle meets nipple wet create full seal . also , it helps " swirl " formula mix instead " shaking " it ... it takes bit longer , but you end up less mess less bubbles	1

i've owned this thermometer three years now , i still love it .... even though i ran out probe covers long time ago . my husband i both use it , it works great our 3 year old boy . ( beeping thermometer makes him giggle , even when he sick . ) far probe covers go , we've found it works just fine without them . we use rubbing alcohol clean off probe tip uses , just we always old-school mercury thermometers our parents when we growing up . yes , instruction book this ear thermometer says probe covers help ensure accuracy , but we haven't found problem . keep mind this thermometer only use babies over 6 months old because ear canals newborns aren't large enough accomodate ear thermometer . exceptionally accurate temperature measurements very important newborns ( so use different type thermometer - not ear thermometer ) , but usually all we really need older babies , children adults measure " normal " , " little above normal " , or " significantly above normal . " my opinion , if temperature over 101 , you ought calling your pediatrician anyway . if probe covers really matter you , pull out instruction manual read it . it specifies you use any brand probe covers recommends particular model number walgreens brand covers . my opinion , first years company very helpful regard probe covers - instruction manual not say " you must buy only our brand probe covers . " instead , they make it clear just any brand work ( long style similar ) even specify brand readily available particular national drugstore chain . factor significantly affect accuracy how you hold thermometer ear . instruction manual includes both descriptions diagrams show how hold child ( or adult ) ear insert probe tip . it very important you use right " ear-holding technique " . smaller babies , you pull back ear straight back hold it while inserting probe tip . but older children adults , you pull top ear up hold it while inserting probe tip . when i neglect hold ear proper position , i always get inaccurate results . ( i know fact my normal temperature not 95 degrees , but that what it reads if i hold my ear incorrectly . ) when i hold ear correct position ( depending age size person whose temperature i'm taking ) , i get very accurate results . my guess people who complained accuracy this thermometer not read instructions , because diagrams manual show you quite clearly how hold ear thermometer . also , some reviewers mentioned getting inaccurate results their young babies ( e.g. , 3 months old ) . remember - this thermometer not babies under 6 months . it not intended used newborns , so you shouldn't expect accurate results when you use it newborn . plus , i can't imagine trying stick probe tip into ear newborn . would hurt ! so , my bottom line this great thermometer , long you use it properly . , probe covers really aren't big deal . get well soon ! :	1
this product what it says it box , it warms up first couple wipes you use . it nice product	1
my daughter loves it .... bathing her now its pleasure her me too	1
i've using this bathseat 4 months now , since my daughter 6 months old . she loves able kick splash while sitting it . i originally this same type bathseat my son , minus little elbow rest , but when trying purchase same one 7 years later i see it no longer available . great thing other one when putting your child into it , front would rise up snap shut . safety 1st tubside bathseat , you slide your kid into it . also , very careful if you " climber " . my daughter loves try standing it . fortunately , elbow rest makes it secure , so there no fears seat tipping over , just your little standing monkey . you still remove your child order wash their little bottoms	1
it took me several weeks before i finally opted purchase decathlon rather than boulevard . i very interested extra side-impact protection only available boulevard model but concerned whether or not my large 41/2 month old son ( who 95th percentile length weight ) would need adjustable crotch strap positioning only offered decathlon . i am so glad i purchased decathlon ! it turns out my son indeed need crotch strap adjusted last slot ( he would sitting top buckle boulevard this point which would made it impossible buckle very uncomfortable him ) . if you're purchasing thin toddler rather than infant or chubby/big baby you might not worry . i love extra padding ( which removable , unlike pads boulevard ) soft cover ( which machine washable unlike boulevard ) . he seems very comfortable i know he safe . i know it doesn't offer much side-impact protection boulevard , but it offer some ( definitely much more than conventional car seat ) it made far exceed american safety standards . plus , if your baby placed middle back seat than offers some additional protection well . i also concerned size car seat whether or not it would fit comfortably , rear-facing , back my toyota avalon car . it . perfectly ! my husband 6'4 " doesn't move his seat up accomodate car seat back ( something i very concerned ) . i see out rear-view mirror no problem . it not block your view all . it very easy install , if so properly , doesn't budge . it little tough adjust straps when it installed rear-facing but not too difficult ... even if you take it out adjust straps it no-biggy because carseat takes only couple moments install easily it not like you'll adjust them daily basis or anything . i am very pleased my purchase highly recommend decathlon anyone looking safe , comfy attractive carseat take them chubby baby stage all way through toddler years . :o )	1

this terrific car seat if you plan keeping it one car . if , however , you frequently swap car seats your cars , or want car seat you bring when you travel airplane , this isn't it . i bought this seat when my 3rd child outgrew his infant seat . compared my previous one ( century ovation 1997 ) , this plusher harness straps really don't get all twisted up . but i'm still hauling old century car seat out every time we fly anywhere britax marathon just too big .	1
my son wearing halo sleep sack since day he came home hospital . winter baby it best thing world know he would warm not worry loose blankets . he began sleeping through night 7 weeks old . i think sleep sack gives him feeling security . he never able sleep without it . he now 30 months old still won't go sleep unless he his sleep sack . we friend ours who seamstress add additional material bottom because he became tall it . how much he loves his sleep sack . it far best thing i ever bought my son	1
like any parent , i concerned sids so sleepsack seemed like perfect alternative blankets . little i know , i would come love sleepsack it warming capabilities . after few months under their belt , babies get very squirmy middle night , so blankets useless ( dangerous ) . so i relied heavily sleepsacks keep my little guy warm , even after risk sids passed . they come fleece winter months cotton warmer months , they're generous size , so they not outgrown easily . i only wish i'd purchased them yellow or white , case my next baby opposite sex	1

i got this my 15 month old daughter , who within last month seems become very aware her bodily functions . she constantly taking her diaper off , so i figured it worth try even though she seems little young . so far , so good . she sat right up toilet this seat went pee-pee within 3 minutes . she very excited throw her used kandoo toilet flush . i clapped said , " yea ! " this seat great because it easily removable , handles little ones busy hands , splash guard when this little one gets little much momentum behind her pee-pee . i think this much better sanitary option than one those potty training units . why try separate little kid later when they start off right toilet ? , why possibly put yourself through hassle cleaning those things , gross	1

when i expecting my first child , daughter , i decided i going buy graco snugride infant carseat . when i my local babies us store i saw safeseat loved fact it weight limit 30 lbs 32 inches height . it bigger little heavier then snugride but i know my daughter safer rear-facing beyond her first birthday . good thing this carseat after she grows out it i won't buy convertible carseat because she go right into booster seat i already her weight range 20 100 lbs . i love this carseat it well worth extra $50 . only thing i didn't like fabric , it felt stiff that why i bought carseat stroller different pattern . i installed this carseat week before i her no problem . i highly recommend this carseat	1
my 3 year old ( 38 inches tall , 30 lbs ) needed new car seat since his younger brother need other convertables we ( alpha omega elite evenflo triumph ) . i oooodles research this boulevard seat looks very comfortable i liked height/weight limit . only my son hates it . issue crotch buckle . it not it anymore further back than others , it just it too short . there needs extra two inches strap beneath it , like practically every other carseat market . he grabs his crotch ( he doesn't wear diapers ) says " ouch " when i buckle it and/or refuses get seat without struggle . little pad thing they attached doesn't appear all much . i try this rear-facing see if my 8 month old ( 29 inches , 20 lbs ) any issue comfort he didn't appear too . it seemed fine him . latch straps , which shouldn't twisted attach , twisted order attach seat my minivan ( there only one way it fits ) . i'm not impressed probably use belt if we keep this carseat . also , something bugs me buckles snap into crotch buckle , only one them actually " snaps " , other doesn't give " it buckled " snap like its partner no matter what i . after all britax hype i've read , i really expected little better . i like lever adjustment alpha omega elite headreast versus knob this one . while this carseat looks cushy nice , i'm sure safety wise it top line , i think we're going sell it just get compass booster seat like i bought our husband car ( my son loves seat ) . we've never trouble getting my son ride carseat until i bought this one i can't wrestle 3 year old several times day into car seat . if you're buying this older child , you might want them try it out first see if they find it comfortable	1

this stroller mentioned baby talk magazine that why i looked into it replacement my current umbrella stroller . it folds up just compact regular umbrella stroller yet it offers so much more . handle bars cushioned set higher up out so your feet don't run into wheels like other umbrella strollers . seat reclines just enough baby snooze comfortably . my 11 month old daughter climbed right into it fell asleep during our walk slept while after . cargo bags great holding keys , cell phone snacks so you don't concern yourself diaper bag quick trips . even though canopy isn't large , it works well . you position it so sun stays out baby eyes . wheels actually suspension . when i would roll my old umbrella stroller down sidewalk i would hit bump , my baby would just get whiplash . but kolcraft , we roll over streets imperfections very smoothly . plus , we love color	1

i say i am mother 3 my youngest 10 weeks old , i wish i would this when i my other two , it all three my c-sections hospital . i using it now almost week , it definately makes diffrence . although when you look it , it doesnt look like much . well there isnt much it but design what makes it so wonderful . i am only 5ft 1in height i say it pretty much accomodates everyone , if you longer legs you just set stool further out what you sitting . if you shorter legs like me you bring it closer what you sitting . it make you more comfortable while nursing , after nursing 2 other kids now nursing my 3rd child i tell diffrence . it doesnt really matter how big you top either or if they droopy . which something great deal women experience when they breastfed , including me . sorry description but just want give most accurate comment i , telling benefits using this normal problems . overall i would definately recommend it anyone who breastfeeds . i definately using it after i am even	1

we narrowed down our choices this one baby papasan chair . we ended up choosing joy bouncer because it $15 cheaper . i'm happy decision . chair sturdy comfortable . it uses batteries , but uses them very gently , so you don't replace them often .	1
we searched entire country bottles aren't made polycarbonate ( pc ) plastic , which contains bisphenol , compound known estrogenic . only bottles us ( besides glass , which isn't option us ) aren't made pc these , which made polypropylene ( pp ) . they good bottles nipples ( silicone ) work well our son ( age 3 mos ) . only problem , reason i gave it four stars , lid where you insert nipple warp if you boil it sterilization , then there major leakage around where nipple should seal . this function its pp instead tougher pc plastic . so , soap water lids ! you boil silicone nipples	1
item shipped quickly . quality good . color bit diffent than appeared picture but still ok . overall i satisfied	1
this product not safe product should not used your child . not only it give additional padding not intended , nor tested your safety seat , but it also voids warranty safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) government agency sets standards child safety seats states " after-market products " should not used . it also not meet fmvss213 standards stated manufacturer description	-1
this high chair great start , but after while tray table would come loose one side during meals . i thought it me , first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it my 9 month old releasing clasp . reluctant change chairs we persevered now , 3 months later , she remove both sides entirely send tray its contents crashing floor . i am worried she either trap her fingers tray comes loose or bruise her legs tray falls ground . if you looking chair last you into toddler-hood your child learns quickly , don't buy this one . i am looking replacement before my daughter hurts herself	-1
before i even opportunity use this product , it disappointed me . i washed this item per manufacturer instructions . bottom pad came out drier all pilled . i wonder how many more washings this pad stand . truly disappointment	1
i received this sheet immediately disappointed . quality very cheap it wasn't perfect fit . i am surprised this made graco - usually their products good . i would not recommend buying this . i would buy regular crib sheet instead .	-1
after my husband i put this together using terrible directions , we've using this free-standing bassinet past 5 months ( not attached bed , some people ) . my daughter sleeping it just fine . however , we attempted fold it up take it us weekend away home recently . what nightmare collapse ! again , directions absolutely no help . it impossible get whole thing into carrying case get it zipped up . also , this thing weighs ton . i now realize i need buy something else use when travelling . how annoying . bottom line : if you're going set this up never take it down , it fine ( once you initially get it put together , ) . however , if you think you'd like use this occasional overnight trip away home , forget it !	1

this stroller great year half . my only complaint until now sunshade .... it doesnt block much sun when up falls off when down seems always catch things when folded ... but i could deal how light easy this stroller . it easy steer one handed when needed folds down very compact . however , now i am suddenly problems it folding while use . it it both my 2.5 year old my 9 month old , so its not related weight . every time it happened i right there , so there no injuries , but i am leary put my children it now . i contacted chicco told , " sorry , you out warranty " their products carry 1 year warranty , i purchased mine year half ago . i only gave 2 stars because it 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding its own ,..... otherwise i would try give it no stars . every mom wants feel their child safe , i am now uneasy safety this stroller	1

shoppers beware : item itself great item but i received worst shipment ever my online orders : 1-even though item advertised amazon new , i received item which previously used apparently long long time . rocker seat dirty smelled . 2-even though seller charges more than 9 dollars shipping , they not bother put manufacturer fragile box mailing box . therefore package arrived cut several locations some items bulging out . 3-some accessories missing i bet previous owner forgot return them	-1
ditto other complaints - won't separate easily- either unscrewing or prizing . cheap , flimsy , leaks water also because no gasket . i'm looking something else hoping reviewers give honest good advice . . . this almost identical product munchki	-1

$52.00 less weighted down cash , i my way what most expensive non-video monitor available local target . surely most ridiculously expensive all highlighted bubbles beside features like " clear reception " " no interference " i would able hear baby every move every household location beyond . we hooked it up short order , turned it , * screeeech * . apparently volume level might permit us hear baby one room away would also cause some sort massive interference monitor reciever . we tried shutting monitor off , plugging second kitchen outlet - entire length house away . no screeching , but it sounded like someone speaking inside tin . totally distorted , useless . you couldn't tell if baby banging her crib bars or if someone moving heavy machinery her bedroom . we've packed it carefully back into box , hoping target take it back without fight . needless say , i'd steer clear this one . our $20 safety first monitor far surpasses this one - even its last leg	-1
i bought this hoping it would help my newborn calm down or sleep same way hair dryer or vacuum cleaner work so well . this thing doesn't white noise sound but i thought maybe womb sound might work . however volume not even close loud enough compare hair dryer . it just become toy my older child who likes play other sounds .	-1
i brought this gift my son his wife ; their daughter born 2/21/07 . when i questioned them why they not used bottle warmer , they just didn't get around using it . i insisted they read directions start using it . next day , my son stated . wow mom this best baby shower gift . they could not believe how fast bottle warmer worked . how much timed it saved them new parents , milk heated just right temperature each time . my son so thankful , i insisted he use product	1
this wipe warmer more trouble than it worth . water resevoir would not hold water kept leaking all over changing table . result wipes would dry out warmer burnt wipes . i emailed manufacturer regarding this product see if they fix or if my product defective . they failed respond	-1
i agonized over whether buy this cheaper pump or go straight one high-end ($250+) models . effort save money i started this one . but i quickly realized i'd made mistake -- it took * forever * even get one ounce milk . i ended up getting medela pump style loved it . i just wish i'd gone straight one saved my money this one . those you who trying decide this or more expensive model , here my two cents : try this one if ... - you very abundant milk supply- you only plan pump one or twice month- you wouldn't mind giving your baby formula if you away her extended periodinvest money higher-end model if ... - you're going back work- your milk supply medium low- you plan pump more than two or three times per month- you opposed giving your baby any formula , ever ( higher quality pump you could build up reserve breastmilk case emergency)also , it worth noting most more expensive models safely re-used other people so could sold someone else when you're ( unlike this one )	1
i thought these would great , but could never get them work right . sometimes they would flow sometimes not . i would take bottom off make it work then remember put it back after using them or dump it all over . many pieces , much trouble , i would upset my baby would also ! switched avent loving it	-1

i bought dual room imonitor yesterday . ( only available store babies us ) . it same one shown here , but it two transmitters montor two children . based only 4 hours testing , i am taking unit back . pro : -the range great . whole house , plus 800ft outside . -no interference . i live dense suburban area many sources interference . -easy setup . -shape/size parent units much better than others ( especially sony)cons : -controls not very straightforward . -the unit always hisses . it not sound/voice activated . -the power switch parent unit button not recessed . when you turn it off , it not beep or let you know you . button easy bump , would make it easy carry thing while it off , you think it . -the deal breaker : power outage requires turns off child units . even short power interruption , child units come up " off " mode . you go baby room turn them . until you , parent unit beep flash red . we using sony 910 3 years our first child . i guess it spoiled us	1
i two double strollers , 1 front back graco this side side aria . i don't use front/back graco much not able both children sleeping same time ( 2 1/2 year 1 year . i peg mt single first loved it . so thought product quality would same . used it 2 years no problems . but say stay clear aria design . our side side numerous pieces fall off , cup holder , seat clip , logo tag , clip hold trays place , etc . its not durable all ! we even close it using pen one side due clip you lift left side falling off too ! we took it plane trip last week sworn whole stroller off . my sister law single same problems product . she since bought maclaren single i am process purchasing maclaren twin techno . it may cost more but it would alot cheeper buying it first than second	1

very useless pants . i bought them tried them my toddler twins they not work all boy or girl i buy correct size . they even leaked when used over diapers night . they bascially nothing	-1
i started my newborn out using avent bottles . after few weeks , she began crying alot . you could hear gas moving her tummy , every time her tummy would grumble , she would pull her legs up shriek pain . she would also pass gas constantly . it so difficult feed her because she would cough , spit cry whole time . then she would miserable gas pains hours afterwards . i tried switching formulas - didn't work . tried mylicon , zantac , gripe water , bicycling her legs , etc . etc . etc ... nothing worked . pediatrician diagnosed her colic said there nothing we could , she would outgrow it . finally , we decided switch bottles ( i switched playtex nursers . ) instantly we noticed difference ! she extremely quiet during feedings , didn't squirm or cry ! she began ingesting almost twice much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy too full gas take any more avent bottles ! ) would go longer feeds . when she swallowed , it sounded different - you could tell she no longer swallowing air ! something those avent bottles made her swallow tons air . i think it suction created inside bottle she ate . playtex nursers , liner inside bottle contracts she eats , eliminating any air bubbles . she completely different baby now . she more alert interacts us much more because she spends less her awake time crying . so if you decide buy these bottles - beware . if you already using them your baby colic , switch immediately ! don't just assume colic " normal " or " outgrown . " babies don't deserve suffer this way !!!	-1
this item packaged very poorly . you literally rip box apart open it . i this twice , both times very last item completely cracked half . very inconveniently shipped packaged .	-1
i bought this my grand-daughter , here my daughter reviews how this product working ( or not ) " hmmmmm .... she loves music more than potty itself . we listen dance " potty " song everyday- but there little progress actual potty . i think way go her may attachable seat goes top real toliet . otherwise she carries potty around room room treats it like seat . i think getting something looks more like real toliet would worked better . or perhaps she going thru phase not over yet , so maybe she get into it again after few weeks . thanks , anyway . " i don't find this very encouraging , so i wish i purchased something else .	1
i thought i would love this but just returned it . it hurt my neck so badly after only wearing it short time ( 10 minutes ? ) maybe i'm too small ( 5'2 " )or my baby ( 5 months 18 pounds ) too large . either way i still find bjorn much more comfortable . i would like something where baby more sideways my hip like this than either facing me or facing out so confined he bjorn , but i couldn't stand wearing ! very painful	-1
i purchased earlier version this product two years ago . i disappointed i wasn't able use it my second pregnancy , most likely because it dropped too many times . this new version comes cloth pouch makes it much more user friendly . also , one set batteries ( 4 aa ) lasted 4-1/2 weeks . batteries my old one would last 5 days if i lucky . my daughter just turned two january 06 extremely smart , verbally advanced joy around . 16 months she knew all her colors could recite abc . 18 months she could recognize all letters . i believe we well our way reading child age 3 . i credit baby plus ? who really knows but we decided not chance it using it again baby #2 .	1

i just bought this one top stairs pressure mounted gate bottom stairs . my first impressions pressure mounted gate fine bottom stairs . however , gates which attach walls screws way more sturdy than even best pressure mounted alternative . we considered this model evenflo " top stair gate " . after inspecting both gates store we opted this one because wood spindles evenflo seemeed less sturdy potentially prone breaking . if one spindles breaks you replace entire unit . also , why take chance safety ? anyway , here few things consider when installing this item : 1 . i took advice others only used template swing side hardware only . this must . it would wall-damaging crapshoot try get both sides lined up exactly right using templates both sides wall . 2 . unless you screwing hardward into banister don't want damage them screws go all way through , use longer screws than dinky 1/4 " 1/2 " screws provided kit . i went 2 " screws additional strength . 3 ) installation isn't big deal . just take your time avoid silly mistakes result extra holes your walls . i found picture-based instructions back booklet far more useful than word-based instructions front booklet . it wasn't five minute job but it not hard all . i'll back few months post my thoughts gate after it some wear tear our 11 months old son our 100lb dog .	1

after reading some reviews i felt compelled share my experience this product . i love it ! i'm not sure if they made different model before , but mine on/off switch works just fine ( its back ) . its not rocket science if you follow directions . i never problems bottle floating . if you put bottle first then fill warmer water like directions tell you , then bottle won't float . warmer itself chart it tells you how long leave bottle warmer what setting . it also light flashes off when warmer reached constant temperature . there no " dings " or timers , but hasn't presented any problems me . overall this product what it supposed it it well . first time mom , i highly recommend it .	1

these really good bottles . i using them 4 weeks now my newborn son . my only complaint regard stage 1 nipples they come you supposed use newborns . flow much too slow . my little boy could not get anything out it he tried tried . so if you plan using these bottles , i would recommend going ahead using stage 2 your newborn baby . i am not only person who this problem stage one nipples . other than , these bottles great	1
i bought this item based previous reviews recommendations not disappointed all . i love color , material easy wash , most all it keeps my baby warm comfortable . i bugaboo cameleon stroller it fits perfectly . my only recommendation would parents purchase toddler size rather than infant size if your baby older than 3 months . bag runs rather small so size labels decieving . other than , what you see what you get ! worth every penny !!!	1
i bought this pump after avent isis failed me electric pump . fact this pump puts so much control over suction power my hands great . im able empty each breast 15 min or less sometimes . although its little loud it manual pump all manual pumps little noisy . reading other reviews i think alot other mothers expected results this pump just arent reasonable . remember most manual pumps arent constant expressing purposes or bringing milk supply . if you read tegh package manufacturer even says they recommend pump emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice day so others feed baby . they discourage it working moms who pump everyday .	1
we britax roundabout our daughters so very pleased them , especially safety ratings . when my older daughter ready booster , choice easy -- britax ! my daughter loves her booster . when i first got it mail ( we live overseas ) i initially disappointed because i thought she wouldn't like side supports , but she loves them ! i would like comment two previous comments .... boosters not faa approved shouldn't used airplane . boosters use shoulder seatbelts . second , you not secure booster down because it not carseat . it used because children under 8 80 pounds too small shoulder seatbelt . i simply want comment those because britax makes great .... safe product	1
i very pleased when i saw just how beautiful this car seat . now my daughter 3 months old i feel i give it review . i read many things complaints but i just don't any . everything works well it . it doesn't fit well all carts but carts weren't made baby carriers fit them so it not bad thing car seat itself . all infant carriers same problem . i recommend this anyone who wants infant carrier likes how it looks . it pretty fits great it stroller . all all , it great buy . although my next time around , i'm passing up infant carrier going britax . they're much safer imo what i've read heard	1

i tried several different bottles , including avent second nature , this only one my baby could get good suction didn't flow too fast or make her gag . nipples same pacifier given me hospital ( which only pacifier she take well ) . i am breastfeeding , all trouble i findnig bottle , i worried what would happen when i went back work my baby fed bottle . this bottle eased my mind . also , wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles . reason i am not giving it 5 stars because it leak if top not really tight , but long i make sure it tight i no problems	1
this great item , but , it some flaws . i got this my 2 month old , he loved it ! now he 6 months loves it just much . thing , you need manually push button , then you use remote . after it plays all music , it shuts off , only way turn it back , press button yourself . not great when you're flying freeway ! but , it still seems calm my baby soon music goes	1
this seat caught my attention because higher weight height capacity , 29 inches 22lbs but this seat also very well made padding exceptional compared evenflo graco every where padded head rest additional egg shock support it comes additional body pillow newborns , until pillow gets snug you remove it.my daughter 13lbs 8 ounces 25 inches her 4 month old wellbaby check up june , now six months old she still fits not hanging out all . i wonder if previous reviewer removed body pillow . it get snug then you use seat without pillow . why not five stars ? instructions bad seat much easier install without base . but good seat overall	1
my daughter breastfed , but we introduced bottle around 3 weeks ensure she would take one ( pumped milk and/or formula ) . we originally bought avent bottles no problems until all sudden 2-1/2 months she went bonkers ! refused drink bottle . granted we bit lax giving her bottles ( not every day , but least once per week ) . i tried dr. browns it same problem . it didn't matter if it breastmilk , forumula , warm , cold , room-temp , etc . she just screamed ! during this time , she using platex ortho pacifier , but begun using soothie pacifer i got hospital . she didn't like soothie pacifier all begin ... took several months her like it . anyway , i randomly freebie soothie bottle motherhood maternity drawer i thought i might well try . she took it immediately !! i since bought several more preparation daycare , she still takes them no problems ( she 4 months now ) . i not any problem leaks , fact she stays much much cleaner this bottle than she avent . my only problem , there no disc put underneath nipple when transporting or mixing bottle . however , stage 1 nipples pretty slow , so long its kept upright it okay . i using my old avent bottle sealing discs milk transport pouring into soothie feed .	1
i researched many breast pumps line before my daughter born . after she two weeks old , my milk supply established , i decided purchase pump . i read many reviews isis so skeptical ... i didn't want pay $300 automatic one . i enjoy breastfeeding so much , however , i am not comfortable nursing public not mention pumping allows my husband feed her too . after much thought , i decided purchase isis amp ; quot ; back workamp ; quot ; . it came pump , bottles tote ( which way very discreet ) . i no trouble assembling it all . first time i used isis i've great success . i am able pump several ounces 15 minutes , without any pain or discomfort i control suction . our daughter not any problems switching bottle breast all , nor we ever experienced bottles/nipples leaking . i assemble pump nipples/rings when they just out sterilizer still wet . i love how easy this use i don't find place plug it work . only thing i've noticed little gel packs don't stay cool enough my liking so i went purchased 2 little ice packs ( . 90 cents ) they work like charm ! i would recommend this any mom !	1
i highly recommend this item . soon your little one sit up his own , this must all moms . it fits all shopping carts ( except costco , but including target ) well those icky high chairs available restaurants . it keeps baby ( mommy hands ) touching cart handle prevents kiddo wedging his legs wrong hole cart . must ! this gift i give baby showers . i've over year it survived many washing touch bleach . still looks good	1
our son especially strong startle reflex , swaddled sleep , all . 2.5 weeks , he startled able get out any swaddle we , no matter how expertly , no matter what blanket we used . so , 1 hour sleep , he'd start crying we'd go start all over . we searched online actual " swaddling " blankets based reviews , chose this one . what utter miracle . we such debt dad who created this ! our son now 12 weeks old , we use this each nap nighttime sleep . he sleeping 6-7 hour stretches 5 weeks , slept 11 hours 8 weeks . we would never this success without this blanket . we've periodically tried get him sleep without it , but his reflex still so strong he needs it . it took little " getting used " method get him wrapped up , but no time we both experts . price amazon , free shipping , way better than what we paid directly through amb . i wholeheartedly reccommend this all parents , especially new parents .	1
i 2 activity centers different makers ( other grandmas house)so i something compare this . i honestly say this this activity center worth extra 15-20 dollars you might spend . begin , seat swivels easily baby move one activity next . might not important issue older babies but my daughter 4 months old when she started use this compared other exersaucer , it really makes differnce seat she maneuver . toys attachments great quality offer variety skills baby learn entertained . i can't say enough positive things this activity center . i highly recommend it it both stimulating entertaining baby .	1

this tent not easy pop up manufacturer claimed . we fussed it while before actually figuring out how it . no intructions came tent . second time we tried open it one spines broke now tent useless . $100 it shouldn't broken easily . when we it up first only time , however , it great . our nine month old son loved it . i sat center tent while he crawled laps around me , chasing some little plastic balls . he liked hearing crinkling tent fabric he moved across it . tent need pegged any kind wind , but this easy . reviewer said tent hot , but we're hawaii where there always least breeze it fine . there also slit one wall tent which allows wind pass through . i'm going try contact manufacturer lack instructions relative fragility tent parts . if i am satisfied their response i order tent again . it really great once it set up . however , i more careful when opening it try find non-windy place it .	1
i recently purchased this seat my 1 year old daughter used it last week beach . chair easily securely fit chair . tray stayed attached , unlike other models i tried . my daughter enjoyed many meals her new seat . cleaning it breeze packing it travel . this great seat great price	1
i decided potty train my son using just potty topper stool . he really loves things all himself just like mommy daddy so i figured would work best him . no matter what i he continued accident after accident . we would sit bathroom long periods time he would always pee after i took him off potty . i decided getting him his own potty seat would enable him sit potty longer periods time , infront tv or living room , family , or his room . i thought it might just thing make him understand so i went internet pick one out . i picked babybjorn potty chair because simplicity design , easy clean up deflector . most seats very small deflectors or none all . some deflectors don't stay put . i also liked designed stay floor not slip , slide , or get stuck child . day this arrived my son three consecutive accidents spite fact we spend most day bathroom . i just give up put him back pull ups when it finally arrived . he scared first but i told him this his very own new potty chair second he sat down he peed it !!! i let him take pot big potty dump it me it ! he hooked . i didn't even need encourage him anymore or harass him sit down . he would just run right over pee then declare " i it !!!! mommy help me dump it . " he only used this potty chair only one day but it definetly what he needed get idea . very next morning he said he wanted use big potty now never looked back . we use potty chair now outings . it great ! easy clean easy bring car !!! i would given 5 stars if not fact deflector just bit low . if my son wasn't leaning forward watch himself pee it would close call . there few reviews stated their child legs squished because deflector so wide ... my son 3 2 months he big boy top 75 percent height weight he fit fine lots room spare !!! only thing concerned me when i read reviews .	1
what previous reviewer didn't realize there 2 different packaging options this item . first option pack contains 1 key 2 locks people who want try it out second option buy pack contains 4 locks but no key those who already bought starter kit happened like product . so make sure you really read description what you're getting if you're buying online . ( this one happens 4 locks no key so you might want try starter kit first ... i actually rec . it because unfortunately lock doesn't work all situations because draw designs ) then top kidco also sells key seperately no locks those who product , love it , happened misplace or lose their key or want purchase additional incase they ever lose 1st key . i admit i think it pretty lame company try squeeze every penny out you especially when it probaby only costs 5 cents make darn key especially when you're dealing child safety products . far how well product works ... i love it wish it worked out better all my draw situations ! it especially great those cabinet doors stand alone don't door next it where you just buy one those wrap around door knob locks require 2 knobs side side . i didn't great luck my kitchen draws because draw panel added actual draw so it isn't flush where you put catch . i put 5 stars bring rating up because last reviewer only gave one it actually great product . i know it outsmart my baby far beyond any cheaper options out there . i installed them adhesive tape comes it but i plan reattaching it screws also included because i personally feel screws better job because i love my child more than my freaking cabinet doors all those worried messing up your precious wood cabinets ... i mean give me break ... holes so small anyway it totally concealed , only you know it there . also , this locks so tight little fingers/hands can't reach inside small openings ( which usually occures other types locks ) pull stuff out . also there option turn lock off kids . definitely consider this product !!!!	1
we love this pillow . my daugter 2 months old she naps it . it fits inside her pack play she lays it nice long nap . it keeps her rolling over . it also fits couch me my husband so we enjoy together	1

this great tummy time us ! we started using it right away , both tummy time just lying baby against . it really seemed help our guy hold his head up look , 3 or 4 months he reaching toys while holding his head up . it also handy propping him when he started sitting up , i used it 6 months when we starting doing solid foods prop him up instead highchair . we totally got our money out this item , it packed up ready next one	1
i bought this my baby when he month old . he now 4 months old loves it . i never change batteries yet . he doesnt pay much attention lights or movement so i just it set play music sounds . he impossible get sleep without it . even if i am staying somewhere else him , this must pack ! it i feed him , bathe him , lay him down , push button leave room . i rarely go back start it again he falls asleep it so quickly . i only hope when he gets old enough activate it himself he doesnt stay awake just watch it .	1
i must agree i tried others - cheap expensive - before finally getting dr. brown bottles . i tried others same claims - even few gimmicks would work theory ( ventaire ) . i only found success dr. brown bottles . these bottles sometimes leak - until you get hang them keep inner-tube empty collar not-so-tight . usually gentle twist collar empty inner-tube then you twist it back ... but not too tight . disks help stop leaks during travel , but you really just need work keeping them upright . yes , more cleaning - thank goodness microwave sterilizers . i simply handwashed then boiled first child , but love my microwave steamer now . markings fading some my bottles , but i believe hand-washing saved them little . i compared avent ( which only slightly cheaper - but lots " transition sippy cup " type advantages ( or breast pump straight bottle ) . i still love my doc brown complaints scratched off markings applied other bottles , too . i personally preferred wide-neck because they seem fit my baby better , but several friends like standard . we all agree doc brown lifesavers , though . i give 3 pk 8 oz size every baby shower	1
this actually pretty good ! i use it warming breastmilk formula . it took few tries get it perfect temperature , but i never too-hot milk , so my baby didn't get hurt . there few times where milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long . my measuring cup markings rub off after 2 months , i contacted munchkin they sent me new one free .	1
we recently purchased this mattress 3n1 natural crib . no problems noted mattress ; however , our son ( who now 6 weeks old ) doesn't sleep crib much just yet ..	1
this tub excellent transition tub baby too big those little plastic tubs , but too small big tub . it spacious enough our 11 month old play ( he big 11 month old ) , provides nice soft sides so when he slips he doesn't bang his head hard sides tub . we got deluxe toys , but i think they more entertaining me than him . i wish we skipped traditional plastic tub went straight this . great buy	1
these toys great . easy use . they even taught my 2 year old how not only blow , but i think it indirectly taught her how blow her nose too . toy years come tub .	1
dr. brown bottles best ! we tried everything else wasted lot time money ... not waste your time buy dr. brown bottles ...	1
this warmer must . it stops most squirming fighting over changes(once your child gets past newborn stage ) . wipes nice warm , but not shockingly hot . i would suggest adding 1/2 cup water container if you live dry climate . i like this model because it not built night light ( eventually light become attractive toddlers ) . it also works very well any type wipe , pop-ups singles . i wish they portable ones .	1
it simpler than i thought it would . no diaper sausage like diaper genie . we use scented bags curb smell little extra . i would definitey recommend it anyone	1
we love this carrier . we live seattle need carrier all kinds trips we both happy this purchase . i am 5'2 my husband 6'0 we both use it ease very comfortable us our daughter . just fyi you really need 2 people put it take it off safetly . carrier massive storage . very good all around carrier . very good price !	1
my baby developed feeding issues including unique mixture colic reflux made feeding times nightmare everyone our house . we started out using playtex drop-ins system worked fine us until we 1.5 months old . then suddenly there lots gas screaming feedings . i switched playtex vent aire bottles screaming stopped , but there issues nipples just wasn't working out us either . baby spending more calories than she taking level 1 , drowning level 2 . plus there wierd extra parts clean keep up . it temporary answer our prayers but still not what we looking . because we preemie , changing her formula isn't option because she needs nutrients this special formula we giving her she continuing gain weight . so real issue become trying make feeding more comfortable her us . final resort ( i spent so much bottle systems didn't work out i almost given up ) , i gave avent feeding system try . it worked wonders . baby eats appropriate amount time now , there only standard parts any bottle clean manage , baby tolerates nipple flow well ( we use both level 1 2 nipples ) . best all special " variable flow " nipples , sold separately-we use those feedings where we mix rice cereal they allow cereal through , not too fast but no clogs either . i like not " alter " flow regular nipples toothpicks , etc . because once you this , there no going back . variable flow nipples solve problem leave other nipples unscathed normal feeding needs . also , our baby addicted soothie pacifiers hospital . we tried nuk , mam , gerber she wouldn't accept any those . but she accepting avent pacifiers included this newborn starter set . my advice parents looking bottles help with/solve feeding issues-buy smallest number possible give it 5 days . if it looks good day one same kind good day 5 , it safe sink more money into it . but if it isn't going work out , it obvious day 5 or sooner you haven't found " answer " . avent bottles passed this test us i would highly recommend them . additionally , if your baby experiencing colic or reflux , see fussy baby dot org tips ideas . also i would recommend specific brand gripe water called colic ease ( all brands not same , see their ingredient page see why ) . fussy baby site this gripe water teamed up avent bottles really helped us out work through our feeding issues . good luck	1
works great . easy use . just bit costly but worth money	1
we comparison-shopped booster seats while , found this greatly superior anything we've used past . price higher than other booster-only seats ( no lateral head support ) , but additional safety factor well worth it . this second this model we bought , so now both active boys ( 4 7 ) ensconced them	1
i didnt monitor my son so i wasnt sure what expect . i thought there would lot more background snow but there isn't it very clear . we vaporizer running all time there but when my daughter cries , her voice very clear through vaporizer sounds . only thing i wish monitor little more portable , maybe battery backup . minor inconvenience . 2-way speaker awesome . when i shower she starts cry , i calm her little conversation get couple minutes dry off .	1
works well banisters . great thing it you remove it when you guest over night when babies asleep .	1
i first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1 . he loved it , it his best birthday gift . since then , it become our standard one-year-old gift . i've given it dozens children received rave reviews every time . when friend bought this my son first birthday , we thrilled . he his friends now nearly four still like swing it even though they mastered big-boy swing . my one-year-old sit it watching big kids play garden he mover - not like sit still all . it also perfect days when ground too wet crawl around ( which seems like everyday lately ) . way , i read ' upside down ' post . i concerned tried turn mine upside down without child it ropes balanced i could not turn it even empty . family may defective ropes or it installed improperly ..	1

after my 20 month old figured out how " escape " , i felt this option best i knew if we put him toddler bed , entire family would up all night hearing him scream gate . pros : really works even hard-core escape artists , made well , makes me feel much better knowing he safe . cons : can't hang any crib toys , can't use " ultimate crib sheet " ( which one best baby products ever ) , your child hate it first , mesh kinda rough so my little mad one red " face burns " rubbing it . biggest downside : too expensive !!! i feel since this company , far i know , only one making this , they feel they charge this much just b/c desperate parents no other option . overall : love product , hate price	1
my 7 month old used this daily since he 8 weeks . he loves it even more now . he grows he finds new ways play gym . he loves music lights especially . he play his own 20 minutes least . this lifesaver me , i use it occupy him while i get ready morning , or any time i need distract him , or just put him floor play know he'll stay one place . i would highly recommend this anyone . i think it one piece baby gear i absolutely would not give up	1
initially , i going get toy box my 10 month old daughter . then i decided she needed extra space her room crawl around i didn't want worry piece furniture she would bang . i saw this product store bought it . not only it cheaper than toy box , its space saver , its portable , its light so you carry it its contents room room , you put alot things into it . baby loves colorful design i love fact she won't get hurt if she bumps into it . also , it zips up top so you seal it . i recommend it .	1

overall i love this carseat but i found out today i driving around handle wrong position . i kept handle what instructions refer position which also setting you carry seat . after speaking police officer recently trained certified car seat installation/safety , he said handle absolutely needs far back possible provided very strong arguement why . manual came seat very ambiguous not specifically say this all . i called graco suggested this statement added book safety concerns she argued seat " tested " handle up it fine . officer i spoke adament infant could grave danger if handle up crash . i think i am going believe police officer vs . manufacturer !	1
our baby getting fussy . we started gas drops nipped problem bud . then couple weeks ago , feeding time turned into battle zone . screaming , back arching , twisting writhing , spitting formula while passing gas , burps sending formula up air . we desperate . so i ran out bought these bottles . good : moment we switched , screaming stopped . hooray ! we still get little screaming if we didn't get bottle assembled properly we leaks , it seems slightly harder get burps out baby , probably because there less air going so it takes longer build up good solid burp . bad : these bottles 3 pack only come stage 2 nipples . flow those too fast , baby drowning . i bought bunch stage 1 nipples whoa , we went 125 ml per 30 minutes 45 ml hour . i tried letting baby build up her sucking strength these stage 1 nipples 3 days , then finally , out desperation , came here read reviews see what others say . i bought narrow dr. brown level 1 nipples . baby sucking evolved time i got those home , unfortunately , she sucks so hard after used these crummy playtex stage 1 nipples she drowns some more when we use alternative nipples . this solution would worked well i got these nipples day we noticed how slow stage 1 playtex nipples . needless say , i thoroughly read through instructions since screaming stopped i able process information again . it recommends you bring nipple tip where hole closer where baby lips come together , meaning , don't allow more than 1/2 nipple baby mouth while she sucking . this worked perfectly we now back 100 ml 30 minutes . ptl ! ugly : addition needing stage 1.5 nipple desparately ( come playtex , puuuuhleeeez ! ) , parts bit awkward . not like dr. brown , but you nipple , ring , bottle , disk , vent cap . lots pieces clean keep up , but easy handle if they keep your kid screaming you hours end . also , you not supposed use bottle warmer this . guess what , i tried it anyway . sometimes bit formula leak thereby requiring cleanout bottle warmer . but it isn't too bad we using bottle warmer anyway , seems working out just fine us . take my advice-assemble bottles while baby sleeping , you can't slap these things together during screamy baby emergency or you mess your hands ( everywhere else ) . bottom line our baby eating again . so i would recommend , i just take away one star bad/ugly portions my review . edit : these bottles temporary answer our prayers . however , we switched avent bottles they worked great us two weeks now . my advice parents looking bottles solve feeding issues-buy smallest number possible give it 5 days . if it looks good day one same kind good day 5 , it safe sink more money into it . but if it isn't going work out , it obvious day 5 or sooner you haven't found " answer "	1
this good buy me . baby wrapper ideal newborns	1
i wish more people knew this storage system . it so convenient - pump straight into liners , twist caps , store fridge or freezer . once milk frozen , pop off caps , pop out liners store them freezer bags . when needed , just pop liner back into nurser it ready go . bottles heat quickly easily hot water . it so easy clean pieces - just soak hot soapy water minute rinse . i bought 4 or 5 storage systems - i bring 4 caps work , send 4 bottles daycare , several bottles stored fridge or freezer . my son , almost 5 months old , no problems bottle-feeding playtex nursers naturalatch slow flow nipples . highly recommend !!	1

" i highly recommend this all !!	1
years ago my first child , i learned hate those clich� , oversized diaper bags , especially when most my outings short errands . why bring what amounts piece luggage those short trips ? this diaper bag ultimate functionality brief jaunts , holding truly amazing amount stuff , but holding it stylishly , boot . it may look small , but i carry three or four diapers , small container wipes , change clothes , nursing shawl , burp cloth or two , spare baby socks hat , teething ring or two , snack , my wallet , keys , palm pilot , tube diaper rash cream , few other odds ends there no problem . there lots zip compartments keep it all organized . i get lot compliments it , which strange considering it diaper bag . fact , woman stopped me store other day wanted know where i'd gotten it , because it " exactly purse she'd looking " -- she shocked learn it diaper bag ! it sporty enough my husband 13- y.o. son don't mind carrying it , either . if you're going day trip , you'll need something bigger , but those typical " quickie " errands , you can't beat this bag	1

good : 1 light weight2 mesh/breathable fabric warm weather3 handles tall enough woman heels , or husbands . 4 nice colors5 easier steer than other stollers . ( use 1 hand)6 folds flat carry handlebad : 1 too light put your bag or purse handles , tip no baby it . 2 doesn't recline3 sometimes 5 point harness takes more effort unclipoverall , this good investment . turns out most parents end up using thier compact ' umbrella ' stoller way more than deluxe , super gadget stoller . it so much easier use these simple light weight strollers , than their bulky , wide , heavy counterparts .	1

we live 1.5 story home where master only thing upstairs my husband runs isp home - lots computers house , so we find good monitor would drown out static electronics outside world , but allow us hear our little pip-squeek clearly . first i thrilled sony when i used it downstairs during her daytime napping loved i could set it voice-activated only hear it when she reallllly awake ! but night when we used it upstairs it kept picking up interferrence form loud static chirp after several hours silence even though it voice-activated mode . i tried moving it several times , but finally ended up going back old fp sounds lights one we which really wasn't any better ! ( run up down stairs try all combinations 9 channels receiver transmitter sony royal pain ! ) next day i went target found first years digital 2.4 ghz monitor what difference ! it same price sony , but it searches clear channel like your phone . i afraid it would interfere out 2.4 ghz phones , but after week , no problems we no static/interferrence ! it crystal clear no matter where house ( hubby even took it into computer room able hear her wake up just fine ! ) i know everyone environment different , but sony definately didn't work us	1
i usually love first years products . i already fisher price healthy care booster seat loved it . i wanted leave one my parents one travel so i thought i'd try this one . i expecting love swing feature , it one thing i thought missing out fisher price one . well , i returned this chair w/in 24 hours bought second fisher price one . here reasons why ; base chair hollow wobbly , it also very wide didn't comfortably fit across normal kitchen chair . you attach straps yourself when purchased they also too wide . their tightest level they still way too loose secure . thought swing out feature would great but when tray swings out , then you wipe baby hands , you're putting your hands under his pits lift him off , he already got his hands leftover mess tray . back chair comes off every time you fold it down . you take chair apart adjust level . when folded up , it not compact portable fisher price model . yourself favor splurge extra $5 healthy care booster seat .	-1
this product absolutely useless . save your money . first problem this product area supposed fit over buckle part car seat carrier simply not fit over it . addition , there no way attach it carrier , stroller , or whatever . so when you try put your child into wherever you wish use it , all it slide around . so it more hassle trying use it every time than just dealing occasional blowout	-1
i've tried lots storage bags , far medela ranks lowest . these spill , you store them upright freezer ... if your freezer compact mine food feed five people , storing milk upright just too hard . these bags not ziplock seal them , which means they leaky unreliable if you hurry ( like if you more than one kid you work ) . buy gerber or lansinoh bags zip seals them . they both stored flat more convenience , they stand their own . pumping into bag fine if you someone who wants fumble attaching it pump ( medela bags ) , or you use your medela pump your reliable pump kit pour your milk into gerber or lansinoh storage bag ease . i use medela lactina plus , i find this method works best me . simple , clean easy .	-1

okay , maybe i should read laundering instructions , which say machine wash then " drip dry " - but who makes baby items can't machine dried ? how many parents time line-dry delicates ? upshot this fell apart - melted dryer got fluff all over everywhere - first time we ever washed it . if you need something you throw washer/dryer when it gets dirty not worry sorting , this not your product . grrr	-1

we switched bottles my daughter more times than i would like admit . she gas discomfort all them . i decided try avent bottles ... i bought twelve them first they seemed relieve some gas . but they leak horribly . sometimes it few drops . but most times it like continuous stream formula . couple times i wasn't paying close enough attention bottle while feeding formula ended up soaking my daughter bib , her sleep sack , her onesie , my shirt . entire bottle emptied all over us before i knew it ... leak fast ! i tried every suggestion given me : mixing formula seperate container , mixing it bottles , using sealing disks mix bottle ; heating before adding bottles , heating bottles ; wetting nipples , not wetting nipples ; making sure bottle rim properly inserted into nipple ring , etc . i wrote letter avent called twice this issue . each time , customer service rep spoke down me said i must not read followed directions ( which i ) . don't waste your money these expensive , poorly designed bottles !!! these worst market my experience .	-1
i owned my diaper dekor plus 25 months . 2005 , i found glowing reports wall street journal most other places . it definitely easy use refills last quite awhile , but ... trapdoors broken twice . i contacted regal lager year ago they sent free replacement . free replacement broke less than 6 months later . you can't expect it contain smell when trapdoors always broken ! this week , i contacted regal lager again they said replacement $10 . i loved this pail until trapdoors broke . unfortunately , it looks like it common design flaw i browse reviews last year or so . i am engineer i don't know what say , except i am really annoyed product not more durable . regal lager would well spend some time money engineer more robust spring system , instead relying $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty diaper pails so fickle ! now i decide whether spend $10 replacement , try fix it myself , get different pail or maybe none above . what point enough , enough ?	1
i thought this would great way keep my newborn son head elevated while helping him feel snug secure when he slept . first night we used it , my husband went check him he wiggled his way down so his head right side supports . he horrified our son could suffocated . this after i made sure our son snug supports they sat under his armpits . i suppose sleep positioner would work if your baby didn't move all	-1

this accessory system not fit my kohlcraft umbrella stroller . i find place put parent cupholder , but there no place all put child snack tray . stroller not close when it attached anywhere stroller . whole purpose spending money this " system " ( which considerably more expensive than others store ) my child snack tray . therefore , it going back store . there plenty other cup accessories out there far cheaper than this ... even prince lionheart cupholder alone very expensive ... product itself also very cheaply made . " " hooks look so flimsy i wouldn't trust them ... again , they sell thicker , sturdier " " hooks look like they work much better than this , so that what i'll purchase . plus , parent cupholder also extremely flimsy ... already " arms " fallen off several times just moving it table kitchen counter ! thirdly , i'm not sure if it " clips " came my packet ( perhaps defect ) or if they all made this way ... but it extremely difficult get screws into clips ... then they didn't fasten correctly . no matter how i tried ( i worked it close hour i consider myself pretty good these things ! ) , i could not get clips tighten properly . they continued loose ... even using smaller screws . perhaps my stroller tubing " too small " ??? very unlikely , but it just might case . this going back store , where i purchase insulated parent cupholder $5 , package two ( thick ) " " hooks $3 my child learn " deal " holding her snack cup straw cup . i save myself $10 , headache backache attempting continue get this correctly , my child get added bonus learning responsible her own items !!! yourself favor don't bother this product !!!	-1

we ordered this gate special attachments our staircase . first all , we order 4 different pieces make it work , since they make you order each little piece separately . we spent all night putting it together it didn't work us . actual gate very small , i don't see how it would big enough any opening . even extension kit , it still not long enough . extension kit so rickety it just kept falling apart . it very poor design way overpriced . we spent over $150 ( shipping all extras we buy ) this piece junk just kept falling apart . save your money buy different gate	-1
just other mothers stated , nothing this pump beneficial . it given me lactation nurse , but it more trouble than it worth . only once i able pump more than one ounce ( it took almost hour ) , i hurt so much afterward nursing my son agonizing . i only needed it occassionally , but this such waste time i bought pump style , which amazing . this not comparable more expensive medela pumps , so if you want something works little discomfort , invenst pump style or similar model . don't waste your money , even if it cheap	-1
we got this well car seat bag wheels . i not going pay $200 car seat/stroller combo , so we picked 2 alternatives . i hoping traveling toddler would great , but i found it too much torque stress suitcase . add weight my car seat ( britax ) my 22 pound 1 year old just too much weight handle suitcase . it felt awkward unstable . physics it just not work . so , we put seat bag wheels dragged it behind us . bag also better our trip because we fly stand-by wait see what seats left . there no more window seats available one our flights , so we gate checked seat i happy know it protected	-1
i've heard some say this best warmer available . if so , parents s.o.l. heating so inconsistent . same amount water same amount milk produce different temperature every single time . sometimes way too cold sometimes way too hot . when heating indicator light turns off you must right there pull bottle out or it continue significantly warm bottle without any water medium . sure loosen your bottles cap during heating check see travel disc not place . otherwise , bottles ( esp . brown ) overflow . if happens cleaning inside warmer major hassle because milk burned onto heating plate . carrier too short mr. brown 8oz . bottles or any other similar height . tubes provided premeasure water joke . caps so hard close open you need two really strong hands maybe multiple tools shut or flip tops open . course , you likely holding your crying squirming baby one arm while trying open cap not spill all water . they tried get fancy shape tubes cap they forgot make them easy use . i just can't believe someone can't design better " mouse trap " . add insult injury , taps handle supposed hold top bottle storage compartment just broke off ... ( picture provided amazon not current model . refer pictures posted other shoppers	1

i purchased this when i due my second baby . i thought peg perego products supposed so great - they always so much more expensive . i don't mind spending $$$ if you get better , but this just horrible stroller . it doesn't turn easily all , wheels constantly get stuck . there one cup holder soooo small doesn't stay upright . there no room any storage : bags , pocket book , keys , phone , snack . they trays kids front so small narrow . seats too tight small- they not comfortable children whether they awake or asleep . there nothing i like this all , it makes going out where ever not easy all . amounnt money theu nerve charge this , they should ashamed . i actually use my orignal " cheap " single stroller , instead .	-1

i bought this pump because it recommended lactation consultant . i thought it would only pump i would need , but it didn't work ! i found this out worst possible time - third day after giving birth when my milk came . i completely engorged my daughter not able latch . i tried this pump it would not maintain suction ! i didn't pump handy express milk hand ( very painful time ) just so my daughter could latch . i retried it several times using all tips instruction manual it never expressed any milk me ! i very disappointed this pump not able return it . waste money time when there not much spare	-1
i ordered this product my 3 year old who just moved into toddler seat head slumping problems ! two major problems this product 1 . ) it quite bulky , so her head would tend fall forward anyway , 2 . ) check if it fit your carseat . i apex toddler seat quite wide , you can't leave pillows place , they stand up 45 degree angle . i attached elastic bottom order fix them plastic holds seat pad place . this works , but obviously only if you're sitting next them when they fall asleep ! other than you'd stop car , get out attach them , then go again , which time child probably awake anyway ! honest , i haven't seen better alternative yet though . it quite good pull around use pillow your own head long trips though	1

we bought this tubside seat just today tried it out first time our baby , who 5.5 months old just sitting up his own . initially it looked great , seemed very sturdy we thought he would love able sit play his toys . however , getting him out we noticed plastic edges around where his legs go actually very sharp , our baby tall end spectrum , it impossible get him out seat without scraping up his little legs knees . it not if he going get any shorter , so i don't think there any solution problem . i think safety 1st could better job making plastic area more comfortable , or even put some padding location . i'm surprised more reviewers didn't this problem . our baby , who normally loves bathtime , it painful frightening experience . we returning item . since you can't leave your baby unattended water anyway , we might well just get non-slip mat hold him until he gains more balance . i recommend you save your money this one	-1

very efficiently drains much milk i get pump style advanced me , very portable easy clean . i use it when i little more time or when i don't expect pump more than couple ounces ( feedings ) . despite medela warnings , i would say you could use this pump daily , aslong you careful fully drain breast ( massage ) , but maybe not okay maintaining supply multiple pumping row	1
this amazing i tell ya , seriously i've doubted it since my first child , then my twins ( never got it ) them , just assumed it some hype . well my last baby , finally girl , i caved . its hard hold baby all day long when you hve 3 other children home keep order ( or try ) anyway her screams out no where , she wasn't happy put anywhere sleep other than you . sometimes wasn't good enough . she cried cried waled . it really drove us all bonkers . she isn't pacifyer baby either , so we loss . she obviously really gassy , she got hiccups alot . she breastfed we couldn't figure out what it , maybe i eating ? sure enough today we tried it , she peacefully sleeping without stirring . i recomend it 110% . my husband got it his work 20% discount , i'm so relieved	1
i bought this chair my third child wish i would've it first two well . it easy assemble , easy use easy clean . i like recline feature 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay it fairly young age . i love wheels because i could rock him my foot talk him while doing dishes or making dinner . one hand release tray dream moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems enjoy toys , too . i only wish it came extra trays	1
this baby gate great !!! top my stairs both walls going 2 different angles i am so glad i found this gate ! it works great i havn't any problams it all . i installed it soon i got it . i didnt seem any problams installing it . i 2 yr old all moms dads out there know how 2 yr olds trying out new things ! it tall gate so he cant lean over it fall . all bars it vertical so he cant climb it . lock it easy use but he cant unlock it . gate made out metal welded together so you dont worry bars coming out like you wooden gates . i highly recomend this gate any room any doorway its great top stairs	1
this my second superyard . first one i bought many years ago when superyard made protruding metal hinges which somewhat hazardous invited mouthing little teethers . aside little stiff fold ( which might because it new ) this model vast improvment over old . it couple inches taller seems sturdier . great blocking off christmas tree or any other part house . cruising babies love go round round inside you hang busy box or other toys side amuse crawling baby . during football season , my friends i take our superyards tailgate join them together make super superyard , so all toddlers safely play together . it easy clean using pressure nozzle hose outdoors . minor drawback it scooted across floor or climbed out determined toddler . i really need say any play yard should always used only under adult supervision ? final comment - one most useful pieces child-care equipment i've ever owned . only reason i gave it 4 stars insteat 5 because my experiences north states ' customer service poor	1
bundleme must any mom . it works so well ! it really eliminate need coats or even jackets . first time i used it i thought my daughter might get little chilly top half so i put jacket her . soon i indoors took her out bundleme i saw she too warm . she actually sweating . ever since then i use it without anything else she stays very warm cozy . we lots snow cold winters where i live bundleme original perfect . no more fussing blanket gets kicked off moment your baby back seat car . top piece also option zip all way off so if it only part needs washed you don't take straps out bottom piece . you also unzip both sides keep over heating your baby if you'll indoors short period time . i think every mom should one i would definitely buy one again	1

this seat took us complete refusal use regular plastic potty almost completely trained . starters , kids like using same seat mom dad .. this seat allows them comfortably . it not too big not too small , fits any toilet travels like dream . mom boy , i don't use plastic guard because it sticks up too much over seat , but even boys this seat mess free . boys , there usually little mess , but because it plastic you wipe it easily . i love it , my son loves it . i wish i hadn't bought potty because my son refuses use it .. only this seat	1
other parents told us these , specifically vanilla scented ones . baby #1 bottle fed took advent pacifier right away . we used scented soothies whenever we couldn't get bottle ready fast enough her likes . not sure if it shape soothie pacifier or scent , but she always calmed down wihle we'd finish getting bottle ready . baby #2 also bottle fed , but not take any pacifier right away . we tried these regular soothies well vanilla ones advent ones too . she eventually took advent . it really up each baby what they like . but these definately worth trying . addition regular vanilla ones , there also various sizes , including preemie , pacifiers attached small stuffed , plush animals easier babies find put into their mouth ... also easier mom dad back car , darkened bedroom , etc	1
my 4.5 month old son never liked plastic bathing tubs , so right very beginning , he big tub tub seat . he loved bath time until just few weeks ago , when he outgrew our original especially baby ( bru " house " brand ) tub seat . desperation , we searched shelves bru settled mother touch . i can't say enough good things this tub seat . head support features soft washcloth-like insert cushion newborn delicate head , it repositioned or removed baby grows . two-position back reclines newborns , sits up straighter older babies . entire seat up high enough quite bit water needed tub , but i found it makes it easier control how deep my baby sits water ( old tub seat , he up his ears order enough water bathe ) . one things my son hated his previous tub seat he couldn't sit up it . design mother touch provides enough support allow baby sit up mostly unassisted , ample padding makes sure he doesn't bruise himself hard edges . even though there lots support padding , it still very important closely supervise your baby when using this ( or any ) tub seat . reviewer mentioned couple things things i'd like respond : * there no suction cups base : i found rubber grips provide more than enough traction , but tubs may vary . * she would like strap : seat i strap ( it stored underneath seat , so may not immediately identifiable ) , so i wonder if seat redesigned recently . overall , my son i very happy this tub seat , i've recommending it friends . they'll buy it new instead getting it hand-me-down , though . i foresee him able use it most his first year before he outgrows it !	1
this best carseat out there . it above peg perego britax . it weighs only 8 pounds so it doesn't break your arm it so easy adjust . best feature base designed so it not move car . i've graco infant seats completely flipped sideways when i made turns because they just weren't secure even special belt clip . only down side canopy bit floppy but it still it job . 5 stars !!!	1
i bought this dakota backless booster my nearly 6 year old . she previously using jupiter komfort kruiser xl100 , which i loved . komfort kruiser booster back , although it still fits her this day , she eager move into backless booster . i think dakota booster works great . it gets her height she needs seatbelt , but allows her feel more like big kid not back . this booster quality item large enough fit her until she old large enough no longer require booster . pocket side handy well , although not work well drinks ( i advise buying bottle holder put arm rest ! )	1
this one my favorite products i purchased new mommy . i love it . it warms avent bottles great . it took some trials determine how much water add but now i it down great . you over heat then you burn yourself if your not careful . it not like negative reviews if you pay attention use right amount water . it not warm playtex ventair bottles . i guess because vent but i preferred avent bottles anyway . cooler keep bottles cold up 8 hours if you remember freeze freezer pack each day . we 2 story house this helped us so much . i other first year single warmer also it my kitchen it great well . this definitly worth money	1
this item very cute . different textures ( just like bedding set ) lot fun . i hung 2 wall above my sons changing table he loves look them . my only complaint ribbon loops they've sewn hang them . mine not sewn into middle square so they originally hung uneven . you easily use nail or other type homemade hook though	1
love it , love it , love it ! no more digging through diaper bag or my purse dirty , lint covered binkies . it could little bigger , my toddlers binky but they fit inside it great idea	1
this stroller holds up 55 lbs ., unlike most umbrella strollers which only hold 35 lbs . i love raised handle bars . they cause less strain your shoulders back . there roomy basket under seat , which great bonus . 8 wheels make it easier steer push over rocks or grass . once my son able sit up his own , i used umbrella stroller exclusively . this hands down best one i ever . it also very modern looking black gray	1
we 4 yr old twins 18 month old , selected this gate means block off our dining room living room . we needed gate ( which already came one extension panel ) plus one more extension panel ( we purchased additional ) total 107 inches across . it wasn't horrible install -- just read directions first allot your self couple hours . if you measure well take your time , it not difficult . also best attach it stud wall xtra durability . durability , you need adult sized hand open this latch -- my almost 5-yr-olds can't it . extra foot adds stability . baby tried many times push it over or break through latch never succeeds . we like you set it swing only one way if you choose , since it prevents it smacking into our dining room chairs . appearance , neutral oak this gate looks soooo much nicer than those pricier metal things . we've received many compliments our wide spaces gate ( matching stairwell gates ) guests , it only takes seconds slide out wall brackets store if we're entertaining company . i think some previous posters either way too high expectations baby gate ( it not brick wall ! ) , or installed it wrong . i would recommend this gate anyone , especially those multiples need gate off portion large area create safe playspace	1
we haven't any problems cleaning this chair -- occasionally we need use crevice tool vacuum , but simple enough . most time , we simple take wet paper towel or wet wipe run it around seat sides . ( we'd any high chair . ) tray doesn't fit our dishwasher , but too easy clean sink . we love neutral plain color oatmeal vinyl . our daughter very happy her chair . she only 16 months , but very big her age she no problems fitting this seat all . our only complaint we push tray release handle when we put tray order lock it into place or else our daughter push tray almost out . may defect ours rather than design flaw -- we just live it since it isn't big deal .	1
i bought this my second son who year old . i love it . it compact fits easily diaper bag . after he eats , i take it restroom it rinses right off . i've started using it home too because little tray front catches food really well ( saves my floors ! ) . i recommend anyone who hates see their child rub their food all over germy table buy this !!	1
it works great me . i 2 floor + 2 kids + 2 cats before i didn't know what going my house . now i hear any sound - guests coming , kids playing/watching tv even when cats jump dining table steel some food . it makes some fone sound max volume , but i don't care - i just reduse volume or change unit position . i strongly recomend this monitor	1
i havent any problems bottles leaking like others stated , but i guess i always check make sure lid right . suction isnt too fast , which great . my baby doesnt get choked . she latches easily nipple since it same pacifier she loves . my only gripe since bottles so wide they cover whole lower part her face it smooshes her nose . there isnt curve bottle , so when milk gets low you either lean baby back more , which i dont like , or either mash bottle her nose . its avoidable , but i tend it whithout realizing sometimes . id rather just stick bottle like playtex curver or bottle slimer . i still use bottles , but i just make sure whole time i'm feeding it isnt mashing her nose so she breath	1
we got our maclaren stroller few weeks ago . we love it . my husband i both tall ~ me 5'7 " him 6'1 " . both us use this stroller without slouching or kicking wheels when we walk . stroller folds unfolds easily maneuvers beautifully . i highly recommend this stroller anyone who taller wants convenient stroller .	1
this pail not need special plastic bags -- you use leftover grocery bags , etc ., which big advantage . i don't know why people buy those diaper pails individually wraps every dirty diaper -- baby poop not smell bad !	1
we concerned using regular crib bumper our tall toddler , but we needed something keep his pacifiers his crib night . this crib bumper job . when he stands it , it collapses , so it no help boosting him over side . my one gripe ( which i'm not sure there way around ) there gap front crib corners bumper attaches front rail ( one slides up down ) . because our little one older , we put stuffed animals corners , but i'm not sure how comfortable i'd using bumper infant who might get her legs or arms caught	1
my son just so excited his sponge bob bed . he climbs out every second thus showing how much he likes it . i like it because it low no accidental falling off hurting himself	1
we waited until our daughter [ ... ] get her this , it fantastic ! she now [ ... ] it storage , but she using it until she [ ... ] i like height adjustable , springs covered , seat comes out easily wash it . ( it poop-eroo us too . ) few things i learned using this though : blue spinning toy doesn't come out yucky stuff collect underneath it . it incredibly hard clean . one i got pain tush get batteries , so once batteries died , we set kangaroo part aside . my daughter feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping it . i recommend using pair robeez , or very least pair socks , protect their feet	1

este producto es tanto mejor que las ba�eritas porque te da m�s flexibilidad . lo comenc� usar cuando mi beb� ten�a unos cuatro meses la ba�erita comenz� ser inc�moda ya que no ten�a un buen espacio donde ubicarla . el safer bather se coloca en la ba�era , no se resbala el beb� queda muy c�modo . mi beb� tiene ahora 10 meses medio le gusta sentarse para jugar mientras lo ba�o a�n as� resulta fabuloso . adem�s , se puede lavar en la lavadora seca bastante r�pido . a�n las veces que no lo he lavado enseguida , no ha olido mal . creo que es un producto excelente	1
this good looking functional gate toddlers cannot open , but most us adults open one hand . ( i show couple guests how it without damaging it ) . we trouble delivery , only because ups left it entryway wrong house - - - one next us empty up sale . assembly little difficult because instructions all pictures very few words . if it installed two walls no molding obstructions , it fine . however , my case , i high 6-inch baseboard i wainscotting chair-rail . these moldings created uneven surfaces i could not install gate without making wooden spacer blocks i paint white match gate . it took me five hours get it , i'm handy ( although bit perfectionist ) . anyhow , it looks works great , we've gotten compliments it . i thought it bit expensive , but i could not find anything else looked good ; it installed top stairs leading into our formal dining room . despite work install it high price , it worth it me .	1
mixed reviews this gate , i hesitated buying it , but i wish i hadn't! my house rather small but there large open area kitchen , living room , hallway , door basement ; this highest traffic area house . also , none walls or corners straight across each other making it impossible use more " traditional " gate . i actually found it easier not attach this gate wall so i change what part house i want my daughter access . it possible gate tip over if my 2-year-old daughter playing it , so i made rule she not allowed " play " gate . it took her day adjust but now she no problem it . i'm not sure durability gate since i not it long , but i think price well worth my daughter safety my peace mind	1
this best , wish i'd invented it ! no more ziploc bags wasted , no more cheerios all over supermarket floor ! this little cup lets child reach fingers pull out several treats ( cheerios , goldfish , etc ) munch away without spilling . no more mess or crumbs all over car , store , house , etc ! i love it ! bought 3 pack , twice ! i keep one my diaper bag road trips ! my daughter using it 1 yr old	1
we swaddled our daughter forever , it worked miracles us she loved it . i also so much more comfortable ease knowing she bundled up nice warm night . then she got too old it i so irritated just leave her crib no blankets or anything . then i saw these i tried them out i love them . we bought fleece ones they keep her so warm . she cuddle them if she likes nice warm like she used swaddle . she seems like them . bottom line her tummy , chest , toes kept warm safe way . i highly recommend these . fleece ones quite warm so if you live warmer climate i would recommend cotton ones	1
few these my new daughter just loved them ! she hated swaddled prefered freedom something like this . plus i never worry her tangling blankets when sleepsack . also not too awful late night diaper changes since it zips bottom	1
we just received this today . it didn't take me too long put it together myself ( hubby deployed ) . i secure my son his sister crib couldn't find proper screw driver but it put together common kitchen knife 45 minutes . only problem i am so far back keeps wanting pop out this one snap parts . my son , john , so excited when he saw this just loved playing it rest afternoon . he went bed right away he couldn't wait get back here .	1
this great product i'm glad i went ahead bought it . i go jogging my daughter nearly every day , so i needed something would block sun well . i using light blanket clothespins , but wouldn't you know , just i got going good jogging pace , my daughter would remove clothespin " shade " no more . i stopping fix it more than i actually jogging . this sunshade , she can't undo it ... although she tries ! i pull it all way down ( low i my particular jogger ) she still see out but shielded sun . i like side pockets - great keys small items - velcro tabs easy use . only drawback - this such minor issue , probably hardly worth mentioning - shade doesn't fold up all nice compact like instructions say . i wrestled my shade awhile before i finally got it folded up ( it matter " doggone it , this thing isn't going get best me ! " ) ... even then , it wasn't very stable . my suggestion - keep little bag it comes semi-fold it store it . all all , this worth it . wish i'd one when i started jogging my daughter last year	1
these good sturdy cloth diapers , whether you use them diapers or burp cloths . absorbancy quite good . i use both these , quot ; gerber prefolded absorbant layerquot ; diapers . diaper service ones not quite good two reasons-1 . ) they difficult pin , work much better velcro closure diaper covers ., 2 . ) they take longer dry drier , thus increasing laundering costs	1
my son born july 04 i usually keep my house very cold ! i noticed when i put him crib swaddled up blanket came minutes later check him , he some how squirmed his way out blanket cold ! my first child , i freaked ! so we went trip babies us ( because every mother ( you know what i'm talking ) , anything just go back store ) i found this item . i only bought one try out go back least 3 more . they great !!! they light one summer you buy thicker one winter .. my son wore this bed till he least 8 months old he wore long sleeve onsie underneath keep his arms warm ! you can't go wrong this ,,, i promise you !!!!! you no longer worry your baby getting out their covers getting cold	1
experienced original diaper genie my baby niece 2 years ago , royal pain this bottom load diapers change out liners . it seemed like liner needed replacing every couple days , probably due " twisting " sausage effect . i received this new diaper genie ii gift my newborn , wow . it truly easy load liner , i used it last wednesday through this tuesday before needing empty it . emptying it easy advertised , i slipped liner through cutter tied off top dirties tied bottom liner where we starting over again . first , it took two hands un-snap lid get it open because it new , now after week it adequately broken , it truly one-handed operation . even though baby newborn , she producing some massively stinky diapers . prior receiving genie ii , we using regular trashcan . genie ii completely contained smell since it use , my nursery now blessedly odorless ! liner situation great . diapers not come contact actual container which extremely sanitary , love it ! also , it seems you safely stuff lot diapers into each load which great . bottom line , i give my highest recommendation this product , 5 stars plus !! this my signature shower gift others now unless i get beaten it	1
my 4 1/2 month baby girl fits well this . i bit hesitant first not sure if she would fit but it all fits very nicely . make sure you decent screwdriver . take 30 mins set it up . my last chair grace 8 years ago chairs come long way . much nicer fit very smooth move around if needed . toy just icing cake . would not even think twice recommending this . this chair considered one best chairs babies . always review [ ... ] .. this group bundles up all reviews all web sites , etc . 2 thumbs way up ////	1
i originally purchased avent everything - bottle warmer , microwave steam sterilizer , etc therefore thought bottles would great . however , avent bottles leaked everywhere you could hear my son sucking tons air when he ate , causing tremendous amount gas etc . because i used avent , i bought wide neck dr. brown bottles they life saver . i threw all my avent bottles away . dr. brown bottles never leak my son rarely any gas so much happier - i also nurse him these nipples seem fit my son little mouth similarly breast . bottles also easy clean - just one more ( easy ) step than other bottles .	1
i got this gate my two miniature pinschers i love it . i use it pressure mount doorway . i previously one those plastic ones all holes but i opted this one not only look but safety . it virtually impossible dogs climb over it . it get scratched very easily , but doesnt bother me , i expected it two small dogs scratching it when they want out ! overall i impressed design how well made it . i would recommend this anyone small dogs long you dont mind scratches	1
i purchased this item myself , i absolutly love it ! bundle me makes it so easy get baby ready go , instead put coat her , etc . i get many compliments it , am glad i spent extra money this version , material so soft warm , it great quality . now instead getting my daughter new coats fit her , ( match her wardrobe ! ) i bundle me ready go , already carseat ! i would definately recommend this item , would proudly purchase it gift anyone baby wintertime	1
according consumer reports , this car seat one only two car seats pass all crash tests . i highly suggest parents ( soon parents ) check out consumer reports before buying any car seats . price it worth it !	1
this wonderful product infants not quite ready adult tub , but too big baby tub . i love how it fits perfectly into regular tub , so it easy fill/drain make easier transition when my son becomes too big it . my son loves playing rings seems very comfortable . my brother super-picky , but after seeing my son tub he bought one his daughter	1
i find these quite convenient giving my baby breastmilk bottle . playtex one-step storage system , i pump directly into liner stick it fridge , then i pop it nurser when it time feed . my husband other caregivers quite glad ease putting it all together when they're juggling crying baby . advice others , i wonder whether original nurser gift set might better , because it comes multiple different kinds nipples , whereas this set only comes silicone slow flow . we've lucked out , my baby seems happy it switches easily breast bottle vice versa ; however , it might handy able try different kinds see which babe likes best . shells this set more modern looking , but i can't see how matters . i'm pretty sure pieces both interchangeable . nice silicone nipples this set ( all other pieces ; latex nipples less hardy ) dishwasher safe , repeatedly boiled sterilization if desired . short shells this set fine , it easier reach bottom squish liner your fingers ( help it collapse ; drop-in liners relatively more shape-holding than regular liners , so they suck air ) , but usually my baby more than 4 oz sitting ; 8oz size shell , burper nice ( it hard reach when liner less full ) , but it doesn't squish liner all way , so we end up taking off shell using our fingers last 2 oz or so . i never any problem leaking . i like disposable bit this system , since nipples , collars , lids take up enough space cleaning effort without bunch bottles around well . liners pricy if you use lot ( $5 50 walgreens ) , but since we only use bottle day , it doesn't seem like much . they also freeze easily . this set came one adapter breast pump ( i use ameda purely yours , they fit together perfectly ) , one-step comes , so i use double pumping without buying any other pieces . overall , i'm very happy this set	1
this great booster seat so far ! it light east carry my son loves it . i like fact it folds half when we travel it easy handle . also , great price such great seat	1
i received this shower gift ( i'm resurfacing new mother - my only child now 11 , so i'm starting over again ... ) it soooo easy swaddle my newborn son . i remember struggling my daughter get her wrapped up receiving blanket matter minutes her wriggling out swaddle . my son , he cuddly this swaddle hours sleeps soundly . even my husband , who two left thumbs wrap him up snuggly without my help supervision ! my only thumbs down this product i notice repeated use my son wriggle his arm out it it looser age . also , i notice it tendency bunch up neck , so you careful when you wrap little one up swaddle . however , benefits far outweigh those two glitches	1
this great . we it our 7 month old son who crawling all over place . he loves hang out here play . he doesn't hurt himself if you add foam playmat under it , it even safer . it nice insetead playard because you sit there kid hang out him . it gives him alot room play crawl . he stand up hold sides . he even stood himself ! other cool thing all toys one spot ! we two baskets toys there him play . this portable light . it kind pain reshape ;( which why it got 4 stars ) but once you it together , it pretty sturdy . it also indoor-outdoor , which great people backyards , decks or pools . folds up very compactly . you could easily store this closet when not use . overall , it great product well worth money . i highly recommend it .	1
this steamer works great , holds more accessories than avent sterilizer . it very easy use . plus , it twenty bucks less than avent . more money use diapers	1
i graco side side stroller . like most strollers , canope this stroller almost useless . why it so hard companies figure out what we mom really want ? functionable canope would one thing example . most strollers they joke . so i bought this sunshade . positive : folds up flat easily ; attaches easily ( though you may fiddle bit find best position ); side pockets nice extra help weigh shade down some well ( you perhaps hide some goodies there because they really not easy spot ); it shelters side well ; negative : hello .. slight wind this thing bends backwards or moves sideways ; when sun comes front , while setting , you can't really pull it down far enough protect your children . living island we deal wind all time so it not practical i would like this shade . but still would recommend it over leaving child just exposed . perhaps if you less wind deal you really like this shade . i gave it 4 star because it protect my children what matters . you deal negative points , but i wished it would designed all weather . i don't see how you attach weight still allow it stand up correctly . material too thin . but i am open ideas suggestions . i don't problems folding stroller together while shade attached . perhaps just matter trying see what you prefer like . all all it worth money afford because your little ones deserver need proctection . till strollers made better canopes , we rely something like this . i also peg perego aria stroller bought single one one . same issue , problems wind but otherwise nice protection . yes you fold it back when you put baby . perhaps main concern designer . easy acess baby .	1
this mobile sends him off sleep every time . i love music lasts so long -- wind up ones , he would just start settle down when it would shut off . there two volume levels ; usually quieter one enough bedtime . my only ( minor ) complaint remote control it makes loud clicking sound when you press it ( enough make him stir , but not wake up ) .	1
i needed gate odd sized doorway looked all them least twice . this gate great bargain extensions included(which expensive buy separately other gates ) . i found it very sturdy no movement or realignment when it closes . i didn't want use hardware install it never problem bar bottom . i installed it my 9 month old tugging climbing me no problems . it good appearance easy operate(visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries ) . i received many good comments visitors i am very glad i picked this one .	1
this bottle solved these problems us : gasspit upmilk leaking out baby mouthlow birth weight(she just wouldn't eat much)my baby started out life breastfeeder 2 weeks diagnosed milk allergy . she not gaining weight . she switched soy . i didn't want try these bottles . i tried gerber , evenflo , playtex , avent . my mom read they helped colic so she brought me one . i used one bottle two days until i could get store . since then , i retried all those other bottles . she started eating less losing more it out side her mouth spiting up again . this her favorite . so it worth it me	1
well , i ordered this item overnight because my 19 month old began climbing out crib again . he this months earlier , when crib not lowest setting , so time problem easily solved . this time , not so easily ... i so afraid he would crack his head open our hard mexican tile floors ! many other moms wrote how their kids seemed love it . wsh i could say ! i love it , because i know it protecting my child potentially very harmful fall . but , he really freaked out it first few nights . i think it would nice if it go higher up , higher arch , thus not making it feel so confining , so much like caged . so he didn't like it all , but , it five or six nights now he used it , simply checks it out , then rolls over goes sleep . but it cost us some tears . ( i'm not talking hours here , five minutes max , worst night ) . anyways , all all , i think it great product all parents who want protect their little monkeys potential injuries .	1
i got this my daughter , who very big her age , grew out her infant tub 6 months . she sit up well , but i worried her falling/slipping hitting her head . this product easy use works very well ! instructions tell you make sure your tub clean dry , you must follow these instructions if you want suction cups hold ! bonus -- it covers up lever you flip up down stop up tub , too !	1
i am very pleased this purchase . i little concerned size , i ordering it 6 year old - but it plenty big enough her , seat very wide could easily hold even larger child . if you hello kitty fan , this great chair !	1
i bought this monitor over two years ago , still love it ! especially now my son out crib . i make sure he not mischievous night without him knowing . i also enjoy plugging this into television recording times when he mishievous , or just plain cute	1
i like style ease this potty seat , but my daughter , hole much too big . she squirms it , not use it unless i am holding onto her-she starts slip fall . i am end up buying much smaller seat . hopefully she grow into this one . she 2 1/2 little small side	1
this toy bin such great investment . i'd give it 5 stars if it just tad bigger . it not only functional toy box , but light portable , carry handles , collapses storage travel , interactive toy itself its " mirrored " flower bright , colorful , textured surface . my baby loves this so i . i it both designs - fish flower	1

i finally picked up jogging stroller now my boy 17 months old . it easy put together very quiet . since its brand new there hasn't time it get squeeky ! my only complaint it seemed lean right until i walked it mile . then it corrected itself i think it nice . other thing left back tire rubbed one time break sits up above when unlocked . but could some uneven ground . i sport model doesn't come mp3 thing i think . i'll just listen birds ambient sounds instead .	1
friend mine bought this item me first i thought " wasted " her money . i noticed she bought it me l-xl course i thought this never ever fit me , after all my pre-pregnancy size 4 . well , i sooo wrong ! into my 3rd trimester , i developed discomfort my lower abdomen back . i decided try this belt it awesome ! i've able continue working out , walking , etc ... because this belt . i love it !! my only suggestion buy bigger size .	1
i love this bumper . embroidered animals plush very cute . colorful too . just any color set you use paint/decorate rest your nursery . i just wish inside this bumper also patchwork/animal design it . instead it just plain blue -- like trim outside . so , when you walk into room look into crib , what you see basically blue bumper . other than , its nice bumper -- set great	1
i love these bottles using them my twin girls since week 2 their lives ( week 1 spent fighting wide necked version this bottle ) once we figured out how prevent all leaks , these bottles amazing speed up feeding time since baby drink continuously . helpful hint all dr. brown bottles : when pulling nipple thru collar , everytime run your finger around base nipple inside plastic collar make sure it fully seated before screwing nipple collar bottle . eliminates leaks completely . not over-tighten collar onto bottle . again , prevent leaks . we learned all these tricks hard way ! :) mother twin girls texa	1

although i am die hard baby bjorn fan , i am not true fan little potty . it small design , no removable bowl which makes it very hard keep clean . save your money upgrade baby bjorn regular potty which well worth money !! we keep our little potty minivan those unexpected road trip emergencies .	1
i'm thinking getting this stroller , but i need know ! thanks	1
this great booster , easy move car car since you don't strap it . cup holders perfect ! good quality	1
this spoon only one keeps my little one getting frustrated losing interest when self feeding . food actually stays spoon long enough him place it successfully into his mouth without food slipping down him getting upset because it . plus curve spoon provides just right angle him hold it enter his mouth he turns his wrist . other spoons which straight handle cannot job . it takes too long reach their mouths food falls right out . hooray sassy once again ! other manufacturers should follow their example this one	1
they look awful but if you sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they only thing really fix what wrong . good news if you use breast shells when you need them above mentioned maladies- you won't use them long because you heal after just few days even if you wear them part time . they come little curved white sponges you just drop bottom shell . these sponges absorb milk leaks so you don't worry it comming out vent holes top when you bend over . i just would rinse them soap water clean let air dry i think each breast shell set come four sponges you buy more if you need them but 4 enough me . note : don't use them collect milk give your baby one reviewer suggested . milk collected breast shell discarded it states package instructions .	1
blue cat cushystraps so soft ! they very easy install , added bonus helping keep straps straight her carseat ... this way , when i go put her seat , straps not don't become twisted process . used bit problem our graco seat before we used cushystraps . my 3 month old daughter loves rub her face mouth straps . i imagine theywould helped hold her head too , when she newborn	1
i received combi ex travel system my baby shower . it looked like perfect size/ weight city living . unfortunately it not work out way . stroller began squeaking falling apart all bumping around brick cobblestone through city . basket also very very tiny inhibited large bar through middle . i would reccommend this stroller use smooth surfaces . carseat great easy use , but stroller not what i expected . one tip urban parent -- sink your $$ into good stroller shocks . it worth it	1
i just baby so writing review totally amazing thing this stage game - that how much i love this thing . they should pass it out hospital . regular swaddles come undone . this one stays place you change diaper without disturbing arms , which so important . buy more than one .	1
i've tried number monitors both my kids ( returned several well ) , but this monitor hands down best longest range least crackling noise . it pretty much quiet . my view , it not worth buying any other monitor but this one	1
i little research before buying this stool i always came back baby bjorn . i decided order it give it chance i'm glad i . it small enough fit my bathroom wide enough hold my daughter it comfortably . she loves stand it brush her teeth all time now . it wide enough move around not fall well it grip top surface little feet . i'd highly recommend this product-baby bjorn knows what they're doing	1
i thought because there no buttons or batteries my three year-old daughter would not enjoy it but i wrong . she loves it !!! this doll goes every where she . i purchased this doll help potty training it trick . this quality doll , when you squeeze her tummy she go potty . feeding her water little hard because you make sure you get bottle her mouth all way . but she doesn't care if she spits water up or if she actually goes potty . she also loves taking her into bath tub too ! not expensive other dolls but well worth money spent	1
i love this organizer . i keep diapers , wipes , cream , pacifiers , recieving blankets socks , rattle book it occupy baby during changes . it isnt meant hold very heavy things , so i put those things baskets shelves table . it holds things you need though i like plain color , one less annoyingly bright thing i am trying put unisex neautral room . i no problems straps like other readers . well worth money , great timesaver also great babyshower gift	1

we both urban lite bundle me . i'm glad we bought both ! thicker urban great colder weather . it thicker , so stiffer , than lite , which makes it easier me zip up carseat then fold ' flap ' down leave my daughter face exposed . windy , cold or nasty weather i bring flap up cover her completely short outdoor time car destination . lite flimsier , perfect early fall i'm starting use it stroller warmer winter days . i personally prefer stiffer urban , but urban so much warmer than lite i'm glad both . switching 2 very easy takes only minute or two . both versions , we just put hat baby ready go ! no jackets or snowsuits needed . we also set cushy straps ( cute fleece animal-shaped covers stroller/carseat straps cushion straps help keep child head lolling around ) those help keep top baby too exposed when you bundle me folded down or partially unzipped	1
i through 5 humidifiers last 2 months . this only one i found sufficiently job ! there no dampness or residue left after using this humidifer length time because there no vapor . after buying others like this , draws dry air releases cool moist air , i skeptical spend money this one because i found others not work well all ! when running this humidifier first time , i could actually notice difference humidity level my daughter room after running it hour . this not happen others . yes , it loud unit but you get used it it great job draining out all other noise home my toddler while she sleeping . i never problem filter or finding replacements , nor i problem my toddler taking it apart . i am very please this product continue recommend it others .	1

i bought this because my 18-month-old grandson whom i am raising started fits when it came time change his diaper . this really helped make diaper changing breeze . even though it states you should use packages you just put stack wipes although sometimes you add water them keep them moist but it works like charm . i always thought baby wipe warmers just gimmick because i not them when my kids growing up but it sure helped solve his problem . thanks so much great product .	1
i 2-year-old daughter little boy due july , so i wanted get something bit more portable than my big kate spade bag . i've looking something like this while . size great- you fit so many things it- 5 sz . 4 diapers wipe container , well snacks , toys , cell phone , wallet ... list goes . however , i am my 2nd one already- quality bag not greatest . cord cinches bottle holder broke within 2 days , one zippers fell off . i just took 2nd one vacation , though it great traveling , bottle holder already fraying top . i keep this one , however ... it only $30 , so i guess i could always get one later down road not too upset it	1
when i pregnant my son i received one those big , bulky strollers baby shower gift , but after my son grew out attaching car seat he quickly grew hate stroller - i . after much research we bought maclaren volo carbon stroller mesh backing ( we live florida so mesh perfect our climate ) i am sure i never own stroller . i remember cringing i spent $100 but we now joke it best $100 we ever spent . it really . we traveled all over country stroller - it lightweight , extremely collapsable comes shoulder strap genious addition . wheels don't stick like cheaper umbrella strollers , it take beating still keep going . 4 years 42 lbs it still carried my son without squeek . ( ok we wd-40 wheels once 4 years we it . ) mesh backing made cleaning stroller breeze . it easily steered one hand , we personally loved shape handles handle padding - pushing other strollers feels so awkward now . basket underneath incredibly handy carries surprising amount . it folds easily one hand foot . my son doesn't use stroller anymore but volo still looks works perfectly so we saving it our next child . bottom line , this stroller worth every penny you pay i t.t he one only complaint i stroller it would nice if seat reclined younger infants . if you thinking purchasing this stroller younger infants consider spending extra $ model recline . sun visor might something consider too	1
i graco car seat my first son . he always uncomfortable it he outgrew it time he four months old . he also uncomfortable accompanying stroller i hated trying get this heavy stroller out my car . whole travel system waste money . after lot research i bought combi connection car seat flash ex universal car seat carrier my second son . i very happy both . my second son almost 10 months old i'm still using this car seat . he very comfortable it , i'm dreading give up convenience him infant carrier . my son isn't exceptionally small . he light his age - he 25th percentile weight , but he tall - 90th height . i am completely shocked previous reviewer who thought this car seat too small . only reason i gave this car seat 4 stars instead 5 because canopy isn't very sturdy . other than it highly recommended	1
i just my third child buy all new things , because i got rid everything after my second child . i sling other two , but instead getting same one , i looked new ones , this far better than old . i like lighter fabric its easy fold up stuff diaper bag . you need watch dvd , but little practice anyone , even husbands use it !! my son 11 weeks old loved it since day one . when he fussy , we put him sling he instantly get quiet . this best one back support also , i think	1
i love this bumper , it keeps my son arms legs inside crib gives me piece mind sids . it also matches my pottery barn green gingham pattern perfectly	1

inexperiennced new mom , i no idea " porta crib " meant speciality sized crib not standard size ( 52 27 ) . i just figured it some kind name brand among all others . no where detailed page it describe measurements , so i assumed standard . i registered this so excited until i tried fit it it too small ! so basically , i just wanted warn new moms or moms who didn't know ~ this not fit standard cribs . however , bumper ever cuter person then photos(a good thing ) , but crib sheet very thin/cheap ( bad thing )	1
my son used this miracle blanket night until he 5 months old . he felt safe , snug , secure . he slept through night 6 weeks ! when fussy or gassy , we wrapped him this blanket he calmed down almost immediately . it definitely miracle	1
