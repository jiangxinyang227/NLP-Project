pros : - mechs bigger part games ( you actually use them ) , - graphics cutscreens great , graphics overall better than before , - couple characters look better , - much harder than episode i , - more optional bosses , cons : - new battle system load mouse spunk ( i say spunk ? ) , - most characters look worse ( especially kos-mos ) , jin travels throughout space no pants , - almost all sidequests terrible , - very short , - story much weaker , - dictionary gone ; so shion glasses , - no shops . why there no shops ? - too much more list . just bad . movie " howard duck " better than this	1
don't buy this - it crash your entire xbox . learn play - forget cheats	-1
small memory which means u only put 1 save it so u run back your comp everytime u wanna save !!! software veery confusing !!! horrible buy !!! i returned piece junk !!	-1
this game joke . it same exact game 2005 version minimal additions . online play so glitchy drops so often its not even worth time . not go out buy this game thinking its better because all hype . if you want play great football game go get nfl 2k5 2ksports/sega sports . this game 3 years old blows madden away any day week . 2k5 you able go roster manager change your rosters make them current . you edit players create rookies like reggie bush or jerious norwood make roster same current 2007 nfl lineups . madden bought rights only official nfl game sole reason madden sucks he wants make all money not spend any money improving his game . madden bought rights nfl trademak through 2010 so no other companies could make official nfl game thats why there no 2k7 or any other game football game it compete . thats why blitz only other game they cannot use nfl players so they generic game without real players . i hate madden passion . 2k sports way go any sports game including football you just some manual labor updating rosters but once you it current still 10x better than madden ever . not buy this game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
all people gave this game review more than two stars bs-ing you . those people probably hardcore ff7 fans - game barely mediocre best . other ff7 releases = advent children , cell phone game , movie/tv show thing . all three things , resectively , sucked . now comes , " dierge cerberus " whoop eeee doo !! only reason why i rented it because title says , " final fantasy " it . only redeeming quality this game cutscenes - other than , boring . if you get more than 20 minutes through game , then all means , it game you	-1
i saw dvd player target $30 yesterday . i especially don't see need xbox 360 remote if it $40 !! space-saving , maybe ???	-1
my only experience this product after i opened it , started play dvd my xbox , when i tried pause it , it didn't work , it brand new batteries . i found ( after much frustration ) if i smacked it against my hand few times then it would work 2 minutes . i took it back exchange hopes it just bad unit , but it sold out so i just got my money back . you buy dvd player not much more than this way overpriced piece junk costs	-1
i haven't even got play it yet because game not work my ps2 . after ps2 logo comes up , screen goes blank nothing happens . i thought it maybe just disc , but i exchanged it same thing happened . i called ubisoft they said many people slim ps2 called say it doesn't work , but they don't any answers . sony said it error format discs , it may not work many ps2 . not buy if you don't want risk it not working !!!!	-1
this without doubt worste game i ever purchased . it basiclly one big empty landscape 16 or so bosses you climb bea t.t hey could made this decent game so easily just puting some minions some characters talk buy stuff . it right now it just really , really , really , crappy version zelda : orcarina time . if you any respect decent video games you not buy this video game unless it sole purpose setting it fire stomping it	-1
ok first all let me say yes this mic nice look feel it .. also wireless it adds its attractivness but over all this mic after long time wearing it really hurt your ear .... it becomes very uncomfortable wear even given me headaches , how me friend needed headset we both bought one ... i no longer use this headset while my freind no choice till he gets his 360 also , this day he constantly say " hold up im switching my mic my other ear cause this ear starting hurt " 360 controller headset wireless it becoming more availible just wait cause end this headset isnt worth price it wont compatible your 360	-1
this far worst instance overzealous copy protection i've ever experienced . i bought this game new local store because i've itching play simcity 4 but game not work my new video card . got this game home it installed just fine , but when it came time launch game , it said disc authentication failed . tried it other disc , failed again . went company support forums found lot other people same problem no one anything help them . thankfully people store very reasonable gave me full refund	-1
i bought this game because it sounded like lot fun . i tried installing it my dell laptop no dice . it would not run . i tried installing it my dell desktop computer again , it would not run . when i went knowledge base , technical support lists if you integrated video card , game not work your system . short , if you " over counter " system , you cannot run this game your computer . i find this ridiculous disappointing . i would not suggest buying this game until you go their technical support page go over all requirements game play . especially since these little facts not listed box	-1
i purchased this remote control make watching dvd ps2 easier . i problems getting it work consistantly right out box . i press most buttons very hard get them work . i hoped it would get better but it only got worse . i am now back using game controler threw remote control away . i would never recommend this product .	-1
people , i don't know what you see this game . it not really bad game , it just average arcade shooter . more often than not , i can't even hit enemy because action occurs so quickly . i pop out behind something i'm dead meat . pick up second one see what it like play good time crisis game	1
playstation controller nice . however nintendo 64 user would remember n64 controller just snazzy , maybe even more so . xbox controller like brick when compared both . ps2 delivered vibrating dual shock controller standard unit . this controller feels great thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing all sorts movement . suddenly 2005 , four years after ps2 released , games like metal gear solid iii : snake eater god war improve this thumb pad function new mini-games feature . controller given new life because this . big negative problem sony ps2 controllers extremely poor quality . this controller , all its design , give you dual shock . first all you shocked how suddenly they break . drop it floor you easily damage l1 , l2 or r1 , r2 wing buttons . even if you don't drop it wing buttons usually break less than year if you enjoy gaming . next shock going through so many these controllers because this design flaw . adding up cost each controller i could easily bought myself ps2 then some more . cord also uncanny ability just wrap around itself kink . i never seen one managed remain straight . also when button breaks it tends release little pieces into controller so even if you don't need button game controller feels like it sand rolling around inside it . all its handheld conditioning controller far robust . i used very similar logitech cordless rumblepad 2 pc same design ps2 controller proper robust model . just comparing two side side makes ps2 controller look like it developed ussr early 80s or something . fact sony absolutely nothing improve quality their own generic ps2 controller probably reason why they made so much money out ps2 unit . it way too expensive even if controller more robust . i hope sony get it right ps3 next time . make these controllers more robust please . ps2 controller always far quality device since its inception only item let ps2 down badly	1
when i bought xbox 6-11-06 it came very good rate time , my son enjoyed it then we returned vacation he turned it we saw smoke i don't feel paying item this price fair only it two months . i can't say person sold me xbox even tried email me since i've emailed him , hmmmm .	1
tediously long weary . nothing interesting , just lot borrowed ideas rtcw , hl2 , etc . i am sick this	-1
i really tried like this game , ea chickened out bought their way out competition . graphics sound great this game , but its ruined ea cheating ai . i never seen game cheat this much my life . no matter what play you call defense always knows what you calling , even if you think you them beat play , your receiver purposely drop wide open pass or better yet defender turns his nitrous oxide installed his uniform cover half field 2 seconds deflect pass . if you throw high pass , not worry lineman installed jet packs which allows them jump 10 feet air deflect or pick off your pass . if cpu wants you lose you lose no matter what you . if you qb going back pass lineman 3 feet away you , even if you press passing button , your qb just stand there so he take sack . this game total bs , there no way get off passes heavy pressure becuase game forces you into tackle animation . when you playing defense , you better off putting down your controller clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while cpu pulls bs miracle plays every single down . remember how i said your receivers purposely drop wide open passes ? not cpu receivers , cpu receivers , regardless their rating catch passes double triple coverage every time . if they don't catch it , ball just gets tipped over over again until he catch it . think you stopped 3rd down conversion ? think again , you get flagged pass interference or face mask penatly . remember your qb forced into tackle animation ? not cpu , cpu get 60 yard spirals while he hit ! what inconsistency you ask ? well let me explain . how it one game you totally , but next game , you can't even complete one pass ! i'll tell you why . cpu wants you lose , so you drop every pass , fumble every run get called every penalty book . i playing game , managed run back punt kr td , before my offense even touched field . then all sudden cpu turned its god mode every thing went right cpu . bs lobs , bs runs bs calls . i not complete one single pass entire first half . its not because cpu playing good defense , its because my receivers dropped every ball thrown them , wide open or not . i ended up only completing one pass entire game , 1 20 i think . this point , i knew i no chance winning , so i just started punting ball first down avoid any more frustration . my so called impact rb only got 2 yards 20 rushes , my so called impact cb gave up 3 td passes below average receiver . what point playing if you not even given chance win ? yes you win games i , but it so inconsistent . if cpu wants you lose you lose , nothing you it . i see why ea bought license , after putting out crap like this , they sure lose lot customers game knows how develop better ai , instead this cheating crap . i am taking this game store store credit i am ea good . ea sucks so this game	-1
i hate this game its worst game i've ever played	-1
you get few outfits some new furniture but not lot . all free stuff out there download sims , stuff pack not very worth it . maxi just milking franchise every penny	1
this pack offered very little anything . decor ( very little it ) uninspired . i hoping get some good artwork least . i know lot people don't like download fan sites but don't waste your money this junk . believe me fansites much better more creative stuff your sims most it free , none it cost much this glamour life stuff pack . this first last stuff pack i ever buy	-1
typical xbox game using checkpoints instead creativity make it challenging . nothing more mind numbing than doing same thing over over again because you keep getting killed right before next checkpoint . granted , you get hours hours playing time it , but only 25% something you haven't already 10 times before . i highly recommend this game people who intellect enjoy working production lines where they same thing repeatedly . if your brain actually requires some kind stimulation , find more creative game . addition , some actions tend bit uncooperative times , such when attempting knock someone out but instead you just stand there waiting get shot . apparently if you aren't facing just perfect position when attempting smash his brains out , you stand there like manakin hoping guy two inches front you doesn't notice . option try shoot him , but unless you get head shot , expect fire gobs rounds take him out since you seem armed what only . 22 short pistol	-1
game itself very interesting - storyline engaging controls unique . it rpg , which quite switch mario . major problem this game interactivity - not enough it . specifically , there far too many cutscenes not skippable . many these cutscenes lead directly into boss battle . most frustrating instance this just before final boss battle - it takes 10 minutes get " real " fight prior save point . this isn't problem first time through sequence , but if you lose 4 or 5 times , this just becomes hassle makes game not really worth playing see end . this major problem most game designers found work-arounds , but nintendo revealed its lack rpg experience this element . it interesting game , but just make sure win , or friend/sibling/(enemy ? ) skip through dialog sequences you if you get tired them	1
this game just waste time everything this crap game gave me huge headache think god advil they said it took then long time make this game what its not worth nothing cameras very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also part this game you follow maze pich dark all you see lines maze you fall off almost every time plus baby crying too just it help you . like i said just waste time . plus max payne looks fuuny this game take good look his face it looks like he resident evil walking dead . they said it took then long time make this game . this game should never release	-1
i thougt there would better story line , what i found very disappointing . boss ( mcgruder ) easier beat than boss matrix-path neo . i mean , i paid good money this game premise it quality game ; obviously i wrong	1
pointless quests no real conclusions . ctd every 30-45 minutes . lengthy dialoge no real human attachment . all all very unpolished product , even patch . if your favorite aspect first game story then not buy this game	1
i bought this game when it $50 because i thought it would great game . i wrong . you dont get lightsabre until far into game all advertisments shows you lightsabre . game extremely buggy poor graphics . i am huge starwars fan would not reccomend this game anyone no matter how big starwars fan they . dont buy this game	-1
sure , graphics sound nice , but this game very linear very forgiving- too forgiving . you save reload just constantly , so long there aren't monsters nearby things made kinda dummy-proof so you can't make any significant mistakes . result , i never really felt like i taking much chance doing anything . dialogue mostly matter clicking responses until you can't click anymore there not much bad consequence clicking them any ol ' order . there really only one path through different areas game nothing ever respawns . you also adjust difficulty levels very easy very difficult but experience treasure don't adjust accordingly . this means if fight too tough after couple reloads you make it very easy still get same rewards you would gotten when it hard . lt ; yawngt ; maybe i'm just little jaded playing online games like everquest so long . online , realtime games other humans playing around you there much more unpredictable , more importantly uncontrolable , much more exciting environment play . i got so bored this i actually stopped playing while close completing very last area game . i just didn't care anymore . this game requires very little thinking or strategizing	1
this remote awful quality ; i've through two them past year . i wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30 ! it worth ten , most . most people would better off buying cheap dvd player , rather than using xbox	-1
my daughter i played all previous games ; we've enjoyed them overall . some games fantastic , challenging fun . this game quite lame comparison others . puzzles weren't really puzzling , just boring tasks . there not many clues find . because there weren't many clues , there no real sense detecting anything . game ended abruptly very short . we not use walk-through solve mystery record time , just experienced lack challenge . we like newness becoming frank joe hardy occasionally . rest pretty boring . if you looking nancy drew game , try one others instead	1
both this game danger design disappointing compared some previous games ( shadow ranch , last train blue moon canyon , secret old clock , etc . ) . game short , i thought tasks bit dull . i also found it somewhat confusing switching nancy drew hardy boys . hopefully her interactive produce something better next time , because these games really addictive , even adults	1
i love idea behind this game it pretty impressively exectuted . i three gripes though : 1 ) it so fast paced i found it really difficult progress past third procedure . 2)i couldn't get magnify reduce ( quick little circles ) work . this caused me great frustration . 3)there no way skip through seemingly endless pages character dialogue if you repeat procedure couple times . i quit playing it pretty quickly	1
this gamecube weak . i owned both nes nintendo 64 those excellent gaming systems . nintendo recent system , gamecube , several problems it design . first all , internal fan slow but , quiet . after hour or so use , system overheats , thus shuts down . second problem , wireless controllers this system suck . we tried 4 brands none worked more than week . brands we tried : pelican , intec , nintendo , osmart . third problem system not built last . i still nes nintendo 64 , which both work great ! i doubt gamecube last past 4-5 years use . simply put , don't buy this product ! also ! nintendo wii going come out soon . description specs , you need stand up interact ( move around stuff ) game . sounds fun but , would you like after hard day work ? it work something like sony eye toy .	-1

this review reference " nancy drew : last train blue moon canyon game + strategy guide " edition . i've played 3 or 4 drew games . this one played faster over before time it took install game . before i installed ' blue moon canyon ' , i installed " morrowind game year edition " , which sold five dollars less than ' blue moon canyon ' . morrowind huge 4 disc game , bare minimum , 400 hours gameplay , possibly might literally endless . entire morrowind set installed up running within 15-20 minutes . after i installed played ' blue moon canyon ' we installed got up running " age mythology gold " also within 20 minutes . this massive game , real time strategy game included expansion pack " titans " . both ' mythology ' games completely installed . this game played explored years . two game set sold five dollars more than ' blue moon canyon ' , or original full retail price strategy guide edition . " last train blue moon canyon " took so long download ... we went out dinner let it download while we gone . we p4 3.2 ghz , 80gb hd , which only 23gb used , 1.5 gb ram . there no reason earth why nancy drew games should take so long , over hour , download ... unless their copy protection program conflicted our toshiba super-multi drive drivers . actual installation not painful download . what painful gameplay . i lot fun playing ' secret old clock ' . whereas most amazon user reviews came across lukewarm game , i liked playing golf game , car chase , " bank shots " reflective light beams aligned . i even felt proud when i finally got sewing completed . i knew drew games wouldn't deliver value two games ( mentioned above ) . but after reading reviews ' blue moon ' i expected more fun than i ' secret ' , even though i knew it would short lived . what let down . game over two or three hours . most gameplay memory test what order what button pushed or stick knocked over , or which way track leaned . ' arcade ' games general store just hit button or this case ' click mouse ' . you didn't even look . most complicated task getting piece paper rubbing . it very boring . price , concern over length download , most unimaginative gameplay set walking back forth train , i cannot recommend this game fun . it few moments math/scale problems but it wasn't enough carry game or balance huge amount needless dialogue player endure listening . i realize i'm adult , but eight year-old little girl ( i bought it ) lost interest after first 15 minutes . she wiser than i . sorry nance , this one waste money , might contribute hardware damage driver conflicts . marf	1
i bought this game week ago . i not purchased prequil ( sp ? ) this game not know what expect . i began playing game immediately got bored 30-45 minutes later . i no played game since . here why : graphics , me , ridiculously annoying . it makes game feel so unrealistic . graphics step lower than " nba street " even more unrealistic . real problem there just nothing . you enter tournements they all feel same . little side missions laughable , i feel like turning off my ps2 smashing controller my head repetitively everytime i play one them . i go why i hated this game . but i won't . bottom line i strongly urge you not waste your money . cover appearance game appealed me made me want buy game ... but don't let happen you	1
my gripe kq6 . one customer said there no differences cd disk versions . this information false . time its origional release , i fortunate high end computer ( its time ) able run windows cd version kq6 which much better graphics character illustrations . i beyond upset when i found out this nothing but dos version . i bought this play windows version my knowlage not work any way any os past win95 ( maybe 98 ) . those who played waiting play windows cd version very upset	-1
i brought this after played caesar3 loved it but wanted something bit more scope controlling dynamics city - i thought civcity game this would offer me extension - wrong - this bad rip off caesar3 , sure , graphics more advanced zoom view but other than i playing same game but less involvement or control . this sit back let it happen you game - keep people happy build everything they'll stay . caesar iv - that what you're wanting , it looks like everything this sets itself up it isn't . feel like i've wasted my money	1
controls very difficult i understand they wanted " realism " but they killed lot fun making you just so damned vulnerable everything . i'm long-time gamer i handle tough game but this just frustrating extreme . plus all people talking immersion ... i just don't see it . i just couldn't get myself care world or story i ; it didn't grab me like some games	1
firstly , i big fan aurora engine pc based rpg games . i loved bg 1 2 plus first iwd but sequal which i found , honest , awful . i raised 2nd edition rule set i never played 3rd ( exception nwn ) but fact this game based newer set rules didn't bother me much . it computer game after all , exact mechanics system i dont understand . thing bother me this game fact it one big battle after . your commanders send you endless suicide runs . it got point where i could simply leave my game runing hour or two while my chacters could hack slash their way through tide randomly spawned criters . it got boring really fast . not too mention difficult well . really sad part , when i read general plot outline , i enthusiastic . i always wanted see what would happen if orc races banned together army attempted invade . but , when you your 5 companions only ones front lines against army ... this point where ( pen paper rpg ) i tell fellow who hiring me shove it	-1
i really could not tell you anything , i still not recieved this game , despite paid it over month half ago	-1
i pretty decent computer ( athlon64/3000+ , radeon x550 ) , but this game not work all . even after i download install patch aspyr ( though there no excuse game not least load straight out box ) , spellforce . exe just sits there sucks up 99% cpu until i kill process . aspyr support unable help . said , despite other reviews here , this game not install starforce . but maybe that why my version won't work ..	-1
avoid this product , wait till ps3 it hard drive hope something better come out . memory cards flash memory flash memory fragile , one whoops it destroyed . damn hell sony making us pop 25 bucks memory card first place . bad : stay away max memory manager ... not load game saves internet onto your memory cards . it corrupt destroy your memory card/cards . one memory card worth more than this stupid thing . i lost two memory cards all my bazillion hours gameplay . also ... disc sucks , when ps2 warm , it won't recognize disc if you break or mess disc up , no way you make copy it use . your screwed ! good : codes work it great whip through game driving you nuts or stressing you out before . if you complaints , call datels us office(727 ) 431-065	1
i honestly not like cheat devices , but since wild arms 4 came out , it actually now use . let me explain ... unfortunately , thanks programming part xseed puplishing ( company translated wild arms 4 ) it impossible unlock two bonus contents game without aid this device , or similar device like gameshark . since this cheapest all said devices , if you hellbent unlocking everything game , you'll want shell out twenty dollars this . if it wasn't this reason , i wouldn't even interested this product .	1
first all , it sad someone would put out product ( 360 ) gets so hot it tends fry itself , unless you spend 10% product cost little series fans . second , i attached this . i plugged it . it wouldn't even turn . waste money . yourself favor just keep your machine open , uncluttered , unblocked area . if you absolutely must provide additional airflow , just point $10 clip-on fan it	-1
i not able get original intercooler work my system . i sent it back got one . second intercooler not work either . it makes nice paperweight !	-1
my son begged this game , price reasonable compared some games so we added it our collection . he enjoyed levels 1 2 , but once we got level 3 it ! unless you earned nickname " fast fingers " or " fury feet " don't bother purchasing this until you rent it . i spent hour trying beat level 3 my 6 year old only thing i discovered i equally well when i randomly hit 4 keys quickly possible ( 57% accurate ) i actually keeping up . this only level 3 i only imagine " dance levels " get harder here , good luck !!	1
my kid played game 5 min only , it not fun . if you want try it just rent i	-1
we bought this game knowing shrek movies bit raunchy , but thinking game would ok 6 year old play . after watching my son play this game few minutes ... i saw he stun chickens put them pot boiling water while they still alive . then after , he punched large turtles threw them tables where there backs cracked open died . i can't believe game rated everyone would little kids ( or whoever played it ) so mean animals . what next , ripping head off rabbit ? i consider myself one coolest moms around , but this totally crossed line	-1

sure it looks good gameplay ok but final boss ( jinpachi ) really cheap lame ! even " easy " difficulty , just couple hits this freak you're dead ! devil within mini-game also stupid , some levels just impossible too hard . i wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want or least just before some critical part game but unfortunately not case here , not mention some save points hidden . imagine getting through most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles , spending around 2 hours or more get boss level , then finally finding yourself trying over over beat boss until you just give up but you can't save your game , then you're gonna redo entire level again !!! one sick stupid game design ! only reason i'm playing this mini-game just get hidden items	-1
dont get me wrong controller inovative feels good really grea idea but one huge problem noone mentioned how these things eat up batteries , put it this way , you need put new aa batteries damn thing every three days , not cool all ! i buying wire controlers now , premium system should included battery charger im othere than this major issue controller great , but again let me stresss this issue ,... it not fun middle online fight fight night 3 your controller ( you just put batteries , well least you thought you ) die , get you knocked out when you clearely winning fight	-1
i bought this because two dino crisis games playstation 1 fantastic survival horror fun , i very taken hype around this game which billed it lightgun game free roaming rather than rails . what they didn't say it almost impossible use ps2 gun fully functioning controller , which what you really need . anything but shooting , all buttons you need really inconvenient places all around gun after half hour play time , i take break rest my aching joints . case you haven't seen it , g-con2 gun teeny-weeny directional pad back it , it this you expected use move yourself around . now , if you try holding gun standard " aiming " style , you'll soon realise your fingers nowhere near right position able reach it . you could just hold gun wrongly reach it , but you need able fire screen regularly kill dinosaurs . they don't sit still waiting shot ! so most game you need able move fire same time . guess what ? it impossible . bravo , capcom . oh , sorry , they didn't stop there , but added further control scheme allow you strafe . this you need still more fingers so you still press directional pad , two further buttons way down gun barrel same time . able pull trigger . but even that end it - if you want still more pain , try using sniper mode ! you may realised , control scheme completely spoiled gameplay me . i'm not fumble-handed any means , but you would need octopus manage all this . which shame , because free-roaming game shooting dinosaurs very exciting idea . dino stalker otherwise presented very well . graphics very good monsters all look very impressive . some stages really good fun but my favourite ones those when you riding some kind vehicle , which means you don't worry movement all - hooray ! levels where you get chased down tunnel enraged t-rex probably most fun game . rest ruined controls , which make your life hell . i'll tell you something else too - most levels time limit !! case you thought slow careful hunt would save your fingers , this rendered impossibility levels clock counts down zero - so if you don't rush through stage , it game over you . kind negates joy free-roaming , doesn't it ? you basically stuck dashing point point , killing everything moves ... might well rails . i don't know why this stupid condition added , dino stalker not created arcade game . it real waste potential , but it only fitting dino stalker miserable failure after release . if you buy it , you only yourself blame . i managed finish it - final stage volcanic pit actually pretty good fun , but this other bosses towards end endurance tests caused me agonising hand cramps get through . save yourself - i made it through so i could come here tell you you don't . could great game , but it all went wrong due impossible way you expected able use gun .	-1
don't fooled advertisments you see almost every magazine . blitz doens't offer career mode it based around game play itself horrible . greatest inconvience game load times . they way too long . loading up your profile inconvience , loading up play game gets annoying when you finish game go save , you start think " f*ck this " . loading time alone kill feeling wanting play . then there gameplay itself . bone crushing hits ? please , outside occasional dirty hit ( which far easier computer employ you , than vice versa ) hits look like early developments madden . plays fairly easy until you get 4th quater when it seems everytime computer magically score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ . then there whole steriods issue which laughable . give player some juice he misses 3 plays ..... conventionally treat him he misses quater . either way , you'll never miss him . this game horrible , graphics load times . save your money go buy game least remotely capture your interest	1
well , it sounds like great game , but after five hours upgrading downloading all specified programs upgrades , i couldn't get video work all , couldn't get technical support all , i gave up returned it manufacturer . great disappointment because i love still play previous versions	-1
this one turned out badly i hate say i bought it . buggy worse than normal , it rough game . fact patch not yet available terrible . support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions . too bad . i trusted pc gamer review it first time they let me down but they adapted more partnership game companies now liberal grading program passes more stinkers . not buy this game ... even when working it not but bargain bin game	-1
this game such sorry state i don't even know where begin . first all , this not all what i expected what i wanted . sid known very complex simulations i preordered this game only because i saw his name game designer . alas , game most dumbed down train simulation i ever seen . looks like sid jumped " easy , fast easy " bandwagon . second , game , best , barely out beta - little more useful less destructive than , say , computer virus . i experience frequent crashes ai often builds ridiculous tracks . finally , aware game one worst copy protection systems i ever seen , which interferes other applications . instance , game won't launch while i run skype . selling game such unfinished state shows lack ethics disrespect customer . shame you , firaxis sid meier .	-1
this so called game very good story plot . it keeps your attention , making you want see what happens next . however , gameplay could not satisfy 8 year old . why you ask ? because there none . you watch 15 minutes cinematics then pretty much told what you . there really not much thought needed since you pretty much led directly where you or object you need . oooooh . there multple endings . whoopee ! you still sit through majority same cinematics virtually nothing . out 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through first time , i would estimate i only needed controller my hand 30 minutes . this makes good movie but don't buy it if you actually like play your games instead watch them	1
i such high expectations this game just them shot down . single player game fine some dumb things enemy ai . muliplayer joke ! well first you get online which basically impossiable . multiplayer which best part 2 totally stupid worthless 3 . one you play yourself . sounds like fun right ? two you drive tank unless you second person tank but you cant just use machine gun which u other vehciles stupid . three there some stupid errors bunch levels where you get stuck respawn yourself . i say rent it before you buy it	1
beautiful graphics nice storyline , but amount times game freezes or you receive error just awful ! not mention , monsters level up you so you'll never advantage . you could pretty much beat game level 5	-1

i can't believe how many people saying how " realistic " this game . not further truth . all cpu lob ball down field 3rd long plays receiver catches it 80% time regardless coverage . what fun ? this itself highly unrealistic . don't even get me started other things this game . ncaa 2006 nothing but arcade game , realism thrown out window this one . ea not know meaning ai . only difference levels amount cheating cpu . don't waste your money , don't make ea any more richer , its obvious they just throw these games together . they just take our money laugh all way bank .	-1
first , let me say i whole-hearedly agree review tiberius . back glory days counter-strike ( 2001-2002 ) , this game be-all end-all 1 ) online video games , 2 ) first-person shooters , 3 ) pc games , 4 ) any video game basically . it real-life weapons , graphics superb time , maps extremely well-made , system requirements still obscenely low , damnit it fun . then , inevitabely , hands time began take their ruthless , indiscriminate toll . video cards supported better graphics , new ( yes , better ! ) games came out ( battlefield 1942 , unreal tournament 2004 ) , hacking became unmistakable poison counter-strike , lot cool , casual gamers grew up or moved . 2000 2004 , counter-strike went utter joy sensation fading diamond nuisance . 2004 present day , it become problem . great games great game developers losing tons money because people still playing this game after five years their mom worn-out 640 megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows 98 . counter-strike still one most popular games all-time , ridiculous number people playing it average day , because people just don't seem enough self-control give up their hopeless addiction . today , server admins , most part , humorless dictators , not stand anything deviates this game undeniable , monotonous drone . people still playing same maps 1.0 release , completely lost all their zest initial potential . it always feels if i've played same round thousand times before , i probably . even custom maps sickening their monotony . fy_iceworld fun 3 consecutive seconds . many other popular custom maps heavy server rotation same way , all look disguisting . i've played probably over 500 servers , downloaded probably over same amount * quality * custom maps , not more than 3 i ever seen server run its rotation , or voted players . furthermore , people still playing game using dial-up , cs veterans always complaining camping , even if its tactic used complete objective . far objectives concerned , counter-strike basically become deathmatch game . no one listen anyone plan ( rare occasion there one ) , no one tries rescue hostages , everyone always calls someone " p***y " or " nub " if you use auto shotgun or awp . top it all off , valve cancelled outstanding won.net replaced it this steam garbage , utility soaking wet incompetence . l337 speak also gained mass popularity jaded counter-strike culture , become its own incessant frustration . but i won't even get into . if you're new cs , don't bother , veterans this game far friendly , you'll probably get called bunch names involving lots zeroes threes if you're beginner . now , if you want indulge yourself great online game , check out world warcraft , battlefield 1942 , sven o-o , or even team fortress classic ( dated game * awesome * community yet lose its initial charm )	1
before i even final fantasy vii , i ordered this game . i loved game , thought ' say , if final fantasy vii this good , then viii must even better!' , boy i wrong ! i'm not bashing final fantasy viii , i kind liked game , but there big problems it . first all , draw system kind hard , but i liked it , it change pace , but way you equip summon gfs ( guardian force ) hard boring . music game reminds me music movie ' akira ' , which bad thing , characters battle remind me crash dummies , way you get new weapons making them junk shops ! not only , but characters not very likeable . main characters : squall- member seed , he jerk everybody . zell-a member seed , he surfer dude dunce . quistis-a teacher member seed , she seems like squall ... one reason or ... seifer- squall rival , he even worse then squall . rinoa- member ' owls ' , square soft ran out ideas , she just like aeris . selphie- member seed , she weird character i sad see her kingdom hearts . laguna- galbadian soldier . he best charecter game . irvine-a member seed , he lady man recycled later final fantasy ix better charecter known zidane . this game second worst final fantasy game ever made . story great , but playing it so bad its almost unbelivable . if square soft remade this game ps2 or psp , i would buy it , but only if they removed draw system	1
i hate this game its worst game i've ever played	-1

overall impression game made rush . assuming " good " alignment , you win simply building expensive buildings edge your influence zone burning enemy platoons sent very unintelligent ai . since winning requires no strategy , game challenging ; you basically same all levels . races against which one fights pretty much same except their " skins " building aspect . defeating them all takes you most 8 hours gameplay . unlike previous version bw , there no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features . cinematics creature apart , it looks like very primitive first version " age empires " .	1
i high hopes this game but i disapointed . controls horrible definately voice acting throughout 90% bad . story line basically typical , it really didn't hold my interest long . i beat game because i spent $50 it day it came out i figured i would least . i gave game friend mine after i beat it he same opinion i . it worth renting but definately not worth buying . hopefully those who decide buy or rent this game devote good bit time trying learn controls	1
this game great design excellent/fun story but it obviously not fully tested before it released pc . whenever there more than 5 enemies screen game horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues . this means bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly commands . clipping so bad sometimes i just wanted find ceo activision shove this game down his throat . this fun game , just don't play pc version . borrow someone xbox play version . this example greedy developer rushing pc port market without bothering make sure it worked right	1
this just sucks main person just keeps running around . he just keeps running or walking which controlled thru key board.no fwd bike control , he won't peddle , but gos backwards quite well . tryed different setups reloads nothing worked . atleast i bought it used not much money . maybe ill find fix try it again later	1
such great visuals i love most star wars rpg/shooters , but , i cant believe this point click game . i hoping kotor2 would implimented normal battle engagement . theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during intense battle actually turn around , click target , then engage someone else after kill . days boulder gate point-n-click should over , but i guess theres crowd this type gameplay . still good game , but dissapointed	1
first off i just want say i've read " secret old clock " it made this game even more boring because i knew basic outline . i see above review adult age 35 loved it , which i understand . but i'm 15 i found this game overly boring . puzzles way too easy , driving around horribly car part game made me want quit playing . it says youll get pay if you some chores people ... i didnt get anything . although i love herinteractive i love all other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 it . i would only reccomend getting it if it value pack nancy drew games	1
paper , idea 24 video game sounds like great idea , upon first glance it , it seems like it firing all cylinders . featuring all major players series reprising their roles ( kiefer sutherland , dennis haysbert , elisa cuthbert , etc . ) storyline tone atmosphere captures feel show , 24 : game falls apart once you get further into it . missions repetitive , animation graphics jumpy glitched , controls unresponsive say least . targeting enemies chore times you use analog sticks , but targeting just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks camera seems want work against you . some this could forgiveable , but further you get through 24 more rushed game feels . it shame too , considering how innovative series it early life everything game going it . if more polish put into it , 24 : game could something special , but it , it only recommended rental fans series	1
i love nancy drew games , i own every one . i bought this game , high hopes -- then i finished it only one day . it simple . yes , like all nancy drew games there interesting characters , amazing graphics , intriguing puzzles , but those good things failed even out bad . game over much too quickly . problem game too simple seemingly unimportant . there not much , three or so mandatory tasks monotonous dull . while character-switch her interactive offered interesting , it could also very confusing . characters , though interesting , not thoroughly developed other nancy drew games . what i consider worst fault all , ending game absolutely horrid . it far worst all games its series . there no action , or chase , or anything really needed brain or quick thinking . it just over . while nancy drew games amazing series whole , this game just left me wondering , " what her interactive thinking ? " i would recommend this game only die-hard nancy drew fans . those you merely seeking fun entertaining game , look some other nancy drew games . i believe " curse blackmoor manor " , " secret shadow ranch " , " secret scarlet hand " best	1
my daughter i played all previous games ; we've enjoyed them overall . some games fantastic , challenging fun . this game quite lame comparison others . puzzles weren't really puzzling , just boring tasks . there not many clues find . because there weren't many clues , there no real sense detecting anything . game ended abruptly very short . we not use walk-through solve mystery record time , just experienced lack challenge . we like newness becoming frank joe hardy occasionally . rest pretty boring . if you looking nancy drew game , try one others instead	1
this game 25 minute introduction or story . square enix really creative stories so good ! however i expect them put something like " skip intro " cause impatient people could really get mad stories ! i , however only get game every five months so i am fine . this only minor flaw . flaw when you want look map or statistics , you wait 5 seconds until it appears . very annoying , but again minor flaw . this game depends how much you like battle same creatures over over over again ! it get very boring after awhile . you train those dumb spirits sometimes you just want them level up quicker . this game gets very boring after awhile you want ditch game well characters . there not much action you limited amount monsters battle . 1.0 ~ 3.5 ----- terrible 3.6 ~ 5 ----- bad 5.1 ~ 6.5 ----- average 6.6 ~ 8 ------- good 8.1 ~ 9 ------ great 9.1 ~ 10 ------ must buy excellent ! graphics- 9/10 great sound -9/10 some voice acting but great fun - 5/10 depends how patient you how you react battling same monster over over again average- 8 my grade- 7 goo	1
i love idea behind this game it pretty impressively exectuted . i three gripes though : 1 ) it so fast paced i found it really difficult progress past third procedure . 2)i couldn't get magnify reduce ( quick little circles ) work . this caused me great frustration . 3)there no way skip through seemingly endless pages character dialogue if you repeat procedure couple times . i quit playing it pretty quickly	1
me , this game seriously disappointing . so disappointing , i didn't finish second case before setting it down forever . i highly entertained - first . it cute , funny , going around clicking things new ds user highly entertaining . however , it quickly got older . 1 . you can't skip through horrendously long dialog - ever . even after you've heard it million times because you're clicking people hopelessly frustration unable figure out what . 2 . i found myself looking internet walk through , yes , this simplistic game . i couldn't figure out what click wandering around hopelessly thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read thousand times just gets too frustrating even my typical patience level . 3 . possible spolier - there seemed glich second story which i talked wrong person wrong time then i could never get ticket into planetarium . after , i just couldn't take it any more gave up . 4 . places people never change . each case , my understanding , it all exact same tiny few places . i'm not big gamer , but i like world bigger than three feet . i let friend borrow it thus far she enjoying it more than me . just help this review - i'm college-age female this my first gaming console , although i've played ps2 quite bit . maybe it really hit or miss but i don't really recommend it anyone but someone high patience level . really high patience level	1
i am huge fan rpg genre played just every one pc . morrowind most boring one i ever played . i turned it off after two evenings slowly walking around , stupid repetitive conversations npcs , lamely fighting rats . interface terrible . you very limited what you carry , so after you kill monster you can't even carry your treasure back town . this " game " all work no fun . not buy	-1

after playing this game third time i thought , ' why i buy this!' this game extremely unoriginal gets boring very quickly . i cannot notice any difference improvements first ballers other nba street . save your money not purchase this dreadful game	-1
my gripe kq6 . one customer said there no differences cd disk versions . this information false . time its origional release , i fortunate high end computer ( its time ) able run windows cd version kq6 which much better graphics character illustrations . i beyond upset when i found out this nothing but dos version . i bought this play windows version my knowlage not work any way any os past win95 ( maybe 98 ) . those who played waiting play windows cd version very upset	-1
this second part xenosaga compares very badly stellar first part , regardless what anyone says . i no longer wanted play this game after only 30 minutes . game begins lots boring instructions very non-intuitive battle system . annoying amount experience points needed defeat nearly every main enemy , including very first one . battle result saving screens painful chore . battle camera inadequate characters look act like small puppets . game very few items , weapons , or armor deal even ordinary enemies , which stronger than expected . skill combination successful main enemy not available until engaged enemy . battles main enemies long , which isn't such problem . however , they often conveniently power up end battle , just frustratingly finish off battle-weakened party . voice acting very uninspired sometimes even annoying . i don't remember any music this game , so plain it . some character changes likely upset least half everyone who liked first xenosaga . very noticeable use swearing , which main reason i don't enjoy or watch hollywood movies during my rest relaxation anymore . new , meaningless characters introduced into story , focus shifted far away main characters . cover character hardly says or anything this time . there one short scene main characters during critical moment , but if you blink you miss i t.t his game far more frustrating than challenging , which not good game trait . i don't recommend even playing this game before reading above , fully prepare disappointment awaits . if you're looking forward anything made first xenosaga great , you extremely disappointed . second xenosaga better completely avoided .	-1
we got this game free box corn chex . we thought , oh this fun since show cool . so we got home played it it so annoying ! there just like black screen before after question shows up black background . just , don't buy it if you want any fun	1
i brought this after played caesar3 loved it but wanted something bit more scope controlling dynamics city - i thought civcity game this would offer me extension - wrong - this bad rip off caesar3 , sure , graphics more advanced zoom view but other than i playing same game but less involvement or control . this sit back let it happen you game - keep people happy build everything they'll stay . caesar iv - that what you're wanting , it looks like everything this sets itself up it isn't . feel like i've wasted my money	1
it pretty much all said , let just say it again ' cause i'm sure firaxis/firefly plant positive reviews here . game takes ages load , voice acting silly ( british ? australian ? herman hermits ? ) , progression totally linear ( ie game fails become more complicated higher levels ) , graphics date 2002 , citizen ' fetching ' system completely random opaque . sit watch awhile : your huts change size every thirty seconds . most importantly , boo sid , boo . you could've produced this bad caesar3 ripoff called it anything , but you called it " civcity " , even put tiny civilopedia it . haven't you got enough money ? civ series brilliant . don't cash it	-1
i swear if it wasn't i liked final fantasy 7 8 so much i'd just break this game then i'd move happy . but i can't because would waste money only thing kept me game fact i did'nt want waste money . this game makes kingdom hearts look like rated game . oh my god this so childish . you know how most final fantasy games they try make main character cool they didn't feel like doing this one . you monkey-man ! how stupid . plus other character way more dumb looking main one im just happy i beat put awful exp . behind me . ahhhhhhhhhh	-1
bought this game strength some reviews here but i very dissapointed it . clunky control system really put me off	1
i really wanted like this game .. unfortunately me , it blows . i'd trade it migraine if i could . gameplay pretty horrible , sword scenes reminiscent pc adventure games circa 1992 , where you press " attack " key swing your sword aimlessly bad-guy . run gun part game nothing write home either . it feels like teleported into body cracked-out , 1 legged , drunken monkey . also , i know graphics aren't wii strong-point , but no excuse regress back 8-bit . when you're trying shoot someone across room , it really sucks when you can't tell them apart flower pot ..... or lawn chair ? cut scene obviously supposed look like sin city . i stress word supposed cause they probably strung together some poor intern after development team went into hiding . they look like amateur flash slide-show . kinda like what your local mom pop video editor would put together if your little nephew gotten his way sin city themed bar mitzvah . this game joke . anybody associated it should embarrassed .	-1
this game looked so crazy i couldn't resist it . i mean disney squaresoft trying merge final fantasy load disney cartoons must seemed like cool idea japan since they love cartoons so much , but usa it just insane . top you voice talents mandy moore lance bass , production values go you knew you one most ridiculous games history . hardcore fans bothered this looked like kids ' game but aren't games supposed aimed children teens anyway ? i ultimately disappointed kingdom hearts . world characters kingdom hearts not really final fantasy disney crossover it just place kids you control out their little melodrama . it like idea disney meets final fantasy just takes back seat . once you get past all hype kingdom hearts boring frustrating . nagging issue tiny areas this game . " planet alice wonderland " consists four small rooms course you spend great deal time them fighting off monsters . combat blend chaotic button mashing watching your party members act like total fools until they die . worst it respawning monsters , you can't take step without fight re-fight hoards shadow munchkins you just defeated . because this you'll spend majority your money healing items . bosses nightmare since they hard survive take forever kill ( 30 minutes normal . ) since combat so simple it really makes drawn out battles beyond boring . after beating 2 bosses i this game . i know kingdom hearts 2 , mushashi samurai legend , final fantasy 13 all same combat woes . i wish squaresoft would learn respawning enemies bosses 9 million hit points thing past	-1
please promise me you never play this . it not worth your time . if you paid money it , try find person you gave money kick them shin . hard . then throw your copy this game dumpster . seriously though , this game absolutely terrible . graphics bad even psx , combat quickly becomes boring all hell , story line confused fact there second dimension pointless . there no reason there 40 something characters , most them exactly same statwise , all them poorly designed . most annoying thing world , bar nothing , re-equip all your character spells whenever you switch characters . you like 50 spell slots . god . i don't think i even need say it , but those crumbums square couldn't pull hit out their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too . they should really stick straight video final fantasy 7 anime movies now , lest they risk making something like this again	-1

you played any games doom series ? how metroid prime ? medal honor ? golden eye ? well , then you've played halo 2 , also , because all first person shooter games exactly same . i don't care how many times x-box magazine ( odd how magazine drools most over x-box game system magazine . ) calls it greatest game all time , i'd rather play mario power tennis which atrocious . story absolutely appauling terms science fiction orientated theme , utterly mundane , unoriginal , boring just all around unentertaining . gameplay so generic it if this first creation some fresh out college video game designer , music cliche , voice acting flat , master chief just all around retard . weapons , oh boy , weapons , again lame aspect game . alien weapons like something kid " toy gun " section toys us , human guns nothing i haven't used resident evil game . when first halo came out i didn't get big deal , i didn't even play it , then eventually i got myself x-box , decided give this installment shot - huge mistake . come think it none games x-box even worth owning system : fable decent , but got old after beating it few times , knights old republic series boring , everything else x-box i could play ps2 or gamecube	-1

i really wanted see how developers could represent playing dragon , spyro only one came mind time . i decided get it , i put it my console , turned it , blown away ... stupidity . -basic storyis stupid . bad dragon plant mean gems kill good dragon . spyro good dragon , defeat evil dragon . everybody dances because goodness prevailes . -gameplayan atrocious story overlooked if gameplay good ( mario ? ) but spyro probably worst gameplay ever . it combines horrible , precise jumping puzzles abysmally stupid enemies . puzzles require you tap jump button certain time . if you don't , you go back beginning puzzle . it maddeningly hard some points , i am grown . so how hard would it kid ? enemies , they should get darwin award . many instances i breathing flame ( it limited reach ) enemy walked right into it ! enemies dumber then retarded 4 year old but margianally smarter than paris hilton . also , they very weak dying 1-2 hits . there also very few types enemies ( like around 2-6 ) but they same ai equally pose no challenge , seeing they weak attack you one time . boss battles so simple they make you want shoot yourself how moronic they . also , playing other characters ( hunter , blinx etc . ) not fun . conclusion don't make mistake i made steer clear this game . get better ones yourself whomever you giving gift . ( oh , don't listen other people who gave this crudhole good reviews , they either . retarded or . never played decent game .	-1
one couldn't stand nba ballers , i thought i would give this game try . pros : create ballernice graphicscons : defense ? if you fan pheonix sun basketball , you love this game announcer needs learn englishthe whole " i-ball trick stick " horrible you sreaming you're stuck second side game required before you advance 1 tourthat stupid mic trick allows you score 4 points one shotstupid watch this trick you can't stop despite fact you still move your player . you can't even block ! you not choose who you want face other game modes unless you playing two player . guess which game i'll trading nba live 2007 or wwe smackdown vs raw 2007 this fall ?	1
don't fooled advertisments you see almost every magazine . blitz doens't offer career mode it based around game play itself horrible . greatest inconvience game load times . they way too long . loading up your profile inconvience , loading up play game gets annoying when you finish game go save , you start think " f*ck this " . loading time alone kill feeling wanting play . then there gameplay itself . bone crushing hits ? please , outside occasional dirty hit ( which far easier computer employ you , than vice versa ) hits look like early developments madden . plays fairly easy until you get 4th quater when it seems everytime computer magically score 21 points no matter what defensive strategies you employ . then there whole steriods issue which laughable . give player some juice he misses 3 plays ..... conventionally treat him he misses quater . either way , you'll never miss him . this game horrible , graphics load times . save your money go buy game least remotely capture your interest	1
this game really big disappointment me . i try this game because all hype all reviews here . played nintendo 64 game titled mario kart 64 i felt like it not much improvement . fact , i feel mario kart 64 better game . only improvement graphics . still , why characters not fingers ? this stage game you would think they would fingers now . anyway , after i played game i played bit cheated . i bored it within ten minutes . game supposed shine multiplayer but it fizzled . there so many gamecube racing games out there so much better than this game much lower price . one example better combat racing game burnout . if you get any one games this series you see what good combat racing game feels like . i feel mario kart double dash !! dumbed down version mario kart 64 . i so much wanted it great game . it no longer hopping ability previous game . me it just wasn't very good . double dash !! probably would better very young gamers they would probably more forgiving its shortcomings	-1

this so called game very good story plot . it keeps your attention , making you want see what happens next . however , gameplay could not satisfy 8 year old . why you ask ? because there none . you watch 15 minutes cinematics then pretty much told what you . there really not much thought needed since you pretty much led directly where you or object you need . oooooh . there multple endings . whoopee ! you still sit through majority same cinematics virtually nothing . out 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through first time , i would estimate i only needed controller my hand 30 minutes . this makes good movie but don't buy it if you actually like play your games instead watch them	1

one most common complaints xenosaga ep . ii battle system annoying ponderous because " even ' regular ' battles , it forces you spend many turns stocking just so you decent damage enemies . " this actually form codespeak . what these people really saying " i'm not very bright , even after several hours playing ep . ii , i somehow never realized how use battle system efficiently . " ep . ii puts great deal emphasis each character attack attributes . attacks classified either physical or ether , then there elementals ( fire , ice , lighting , aura ) finally there types ( slash/pierce/hit ) . sound complicated ? eh , little more so than average rpg . not nearly bad something like vagrant story . all you use analyze any enemy you're unfamiliar see their weaknesses , then use change command bring character proper attack . when you come across enemies physical/elemental weaknesses , there ethers which you cast add element character physical attack . if their weakness ether/elemental , then just use standard elemental spell ethers against them . this all you need make battles flow nice , normal pace . some reason , vast majority ep . ii players seemed never realize this . instead , they saw their only option using stock command nine ( nine ! ) turns row before beginning their attack . even wimpy garden variety wandering monsters ! they took no heed enemy weaknesses , using characters physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs . ether/ice . rpg players used reputation more intelligent gamers . i wonder what happened ... lot ep . i fans never bothered play ep . ii because negative word mouth spread so quickly amongst fanbase soon jp version released . but now ep . iii out ( it truly fantastic ) lot them finally play ep . ii soon . i hope they better than first rounders	1

if you liked first disgaea you just love second one ! game builds upon all strong points previous game . now instead taking forever get powerful characters you achieve characters like archer , ninja , etc . much quicker . main characters still hilarious , i love fact you get see laharl , etna gang again this one . ( go prism rangers =/ ) . once again plot isn't too twisted , but it enjoyable . back game play though , its similar old one , but you more options . one , you join dark assembly . item world you not only level your item , but go assembly , improve luck your item , purchase items such alcohol bombs influence assembly . there also new addition subpoena . these felony charges your characters receive based upon too many murders , too much hp etc . etc . these " medals honor " demon world , allow your characters more prestige , not mention they once again make you want go item world . bonus , you transfer bailiff your subpoena onto your item , so you get felony charge , level your item same time . this game fabulous addition any gamer collection , i highly recommend it ! enjoy	1
final fantasy vii : dirge cerberus said last spin off ( aside psp crisis core ) , one goes furthest into future vii world . game seems like must-play final fantasy vii vincent valentine fans alike , it . thinking , most those fans probably play mostly rpgs , this game relatively easier than popular fps ( shooters ) like halo . rpg-fan , yet still wanting learn story game , i very happy easy difficulty ( though it bumped up something more difficult there plenty extras difficult get outside story mode . ) controls little bad , but nothing someone can't get used . one square second or third shooter games , this one pretty good . i'd recommend if you're doing what i playing it story , then get official guide so you get all hidden capsules you go ( which unlocks cutscenes once you retrieve them , you never get them again ) . guide actually pretty good this game , well soundtrack . if you're fan final fantasy music , definitely pick soundtrack up . lastly , if you're final fantasy fan or rpg fan , get this game everything related it . it worth it . i couldn't put this game down , even if some characters bit under-developed . if you're shooter fan games like halo you probably disappointed	1
i same opinion everyone else , controller very convenient , appealing , affordable fun , but ...... it suddenly stopped working .... i think there some problems wireless connection , its very frustrating middle action boom .... your controller stops respondind ..... you get killed ..... it sucks !!! i see lot people same problem i .... what i solve it , changing batteries then putting them back again , or use dual shock while then plug logitech again ... worked me ..... it sounds silly but somehow works .... so , if you want great wireless controller , this it , but aware this problem little annoying you probably it too ......	1

gta series created new thresshold video games . creation gta 3 , games became increasingly more violent more controversal . san andreas no exception . if this game not bear gta tag , i probably would rated it higher , but needless say , i'm bit disappointed what rockstar this addition gta series . previous gtas all quirky jab political social icons ( particularly conversation political social icons ) . san andreas this , but much lesser extent which disappointed me . thing which disappointed me this game rpg-like system they put into it . your accuracy determined how often you practice , rather than players ablity shoot . also , unlike previous gtas , you must now press button slow your walking speed down manually aim fire gun . i hated this change gameplay . this severely limits your ablity go rampages , forces you use their god-awful auto aim system . if they not added this function game , i probably would enjoyed it lot more . said , there plenty things i enjoyed this game . first off , i enjoyed new depth theyve added missions . previously missions followed : kill this , blow up , run way these guys , avoid cops . missions this game actually feel like rockstar put lot time into each individual objective . one mission particularly comes mind mission where you hop plane , small shootout inside vehicle , then fly liberty cities ( location you cannot travel normally ) assassinate some crime bosses . little things like this show extra effort designers put into game . thing i enjoyed this game it more challengeing than previous gtas . very last mission you cussing like mad if you havent achieved fire proofing firetruck missions . this game designed skill level someone who playing gta long time . also map friggin huge ! its 3 times size your regular gta game . however , unlike previous gtas , its not packed little goodies special jumps every corner . its still fun explore every corner map this game though . so now break down my reviewpros-incredibly large map-challengeing-more new vehicles hijack-an overall improvement missions-plenty extra features-gang wars-good voice actingthe cons-new style shooting huge hinderance-areas not packed goodies before-fewer political cheap shots than sa predcisoursoverall i would give this game 8 out 10 comparison video games everywhere , but only 4 out 10 when compared its predecesors ( 5 average ) . one other note : if you ati radeon x700 you may encounter some problems playing this game ( not lag , but actually loading game )	1
it works really well their no problem cable enhanced quality picture much better original a/v cables	1

this first karaoke revolution game i received , i enjoy it very much ! however , songs game i found quite old , even someone like myself , senior college . i dont know rest you , but 80 blur me . i didnt know these songs very well , which put major hinderance game play . i liked high amount songs they put he recent game , but i already ordered karaoke revolution volume 3 after seeing more recent songs i would know . i found " sing dance " mode challenging , if you dont know song heart , dont play it , because you need watching arrows where your feet should going . i would also recommend wireless microphone dance pad ( if they exist ) since cord get way your dancing moves . i thought it really cool game sense initiative , over 50 different unlockable items ( although 90% which items you use create your character , or just new character ) . some songs listed here need unlocked through game play . i'm sorry i couldnt think every artist these songs , but if it isnt listed , assume its least 15 years ago . 1 .

i can't get enough okami ! i've beaten it am started second play-though . any action-rpg game fan least try this game ! title basically says it all . it typically japanese play words , since , depending how you translate it , " okami " mean either " wolf " or " king gods " . those people whom not enough information really understand game , here basics : 100 years before game beginning , huge 8-headed dragon monster called orochi menaced small village kamiki . after suffering orochi tyranny years , village champion , nagi , white wolf village dubbed shiranui , defeated orochi . shiranui died his wounds after fight , village built shrine him . peace reigned 100 years , until evil suddenly mysteriously reappeared ... you control shiranui reborn quest save land evil . you travel all over land nippon ( which japanese " japan " ; how original ) fighting monsters , helping people , healing nature curse evil . story nothing new , both very linear quite predictable . but it very well , mixing japanese mythology into classic hero story , generous helping humor give it flavor . story one major downside , though : it told through cut scenes contain bucket-loads exposition . you often find yourself button-mashing desperately try speed things , not work very well because important cut scenes don't let you speed up dialogue . instance , very first cut scene opens game literally takes least 15 minutes get through before you get action . most rest not nearly long , but several them take good 5 minutes least . say it gets tedious understatement . still , cell-shaded graphics largely make up tedious cut scenes . they very beautiful , yet simplistic style evokes traditional japanese ink painting . despite simple style , though , level detail outstanding . fact , it so detailed there occasional spot graphical slowdown . this game really pushes hardware ps2 its limits . music sound also fantastic . most music evokes traditional japanese art much graphics , while sound effects range wolf barks footfalls wind blowing gently through trees , more . mood always set perfectly whatever environment you're visiting . except , possibly , voices . rather than real voices , people talk form gibberish sounds like someone trying talk underwater . while it not bother me personally , some people simply not listen these voice effects . either you'll hate voice noises passion , or you won't care all . either way , this not good point game . controls take bit getting used , but when you gotten used them they become second nature . unlike " legend zelda " games , there no enemy lock-on during combat . instead , you automatically target closest monster(s ) when you push attack button . this simplifies combat without turning it into button-mashing cake walk . it works perfectly ... unless you get hit controller bug . yes , * bug * game . thankfully rare , i only encountered it twice 60+ hours game play . still , when it happens it extremely annoying . during combat , while you're wailing away monster , options-menu suddenly open no reason . usually , analog control your controller also go crazy , either just turning off or madly flickering off . either case makes game impossible play , course , since you control your in-game avatar left analog stick . first case easy fix ; just turn analog control back exit menu . second case , you only fix it literally unplugging controller then plugging it back . far more common than controller bug load times . they usually not terrible , but it seems like loading screen comes up least every five minutes or so . these long cut-scenes , you might sometimes wonder if there actually any game play included . but there * * game play , it lot fun . there great deal keep you occupied , compelling story line many treasure hunts , races , puzzles , mini-games . fighting save world , you go fishing , feed animals , catch thieves , lot more . plus , after you beat game once it unlocks lots extras , including image galleries sound track . all wonderful atmosphere definitely make this game worth checking out . rent it before you buy it , if possible , make sure you deal long cut scenes , numerous load times , weird voice effects . but if you fan action rpgs like " legend zelda " , you definitely want add okami your game library . summary : pros : - great story- great graphics- great music/sound- wonderful atmosphere- lots culture mythology give it flavor- plentiful activities mini-games- unlockable extras after beating gamecons : - occasional graphic slowdown- too much exposition- tedious cut-scenes- lots load times- rare controller bugneutral : - voice noises you might or might not hateover-all score : five stars fun-fun-fun ! but three stars over all because many problems	1
when i first looked this game store i wasn't real sure it . i totally surprised when i got it home tried it out . it starts out slow but only prepare you what come ! it greatest storyline add great graphics , wonderful characters easy learn controls . put all together you okami !! i am avid gamer i love all types but mainly enjoy action/adventure . i am 36 year old mother 4 i so enjoy sitting down my kids kicking their butt ( game coarse)we all so much fun together . i know alot people look down video games general but i spend quality time my kids ! anyway , this game absolute masterpiece ! it it all ! i played god war , samari warriors 1 , 2 ex . legends , dynasty warriors , norrath , balders gate just name few . this game icing cake ! i never written reviews any games before but i just couldn't keep saying something this game !! i plan play it over over because i know there plenty more this game i may missed first time . this game qualifier , if not winner game year !!!! respectfully , pretty mam	1
i all " grand theft " games this one my favs . i highly recommend it all others . i recently purchased " liberty city " awesome	1
i really , really enjoyed this game . it only game i played almost 2 months , i so hooked it . my only criticism missions too rigid , so outcomes very much same during re-play , even if you make different choices . i thought it really neat character changes according what you - e.g. too much eating , he gets fat .	1
seriously . you could just hold up finger close camera lens just wave it back forth . perfect way cheating . game not bad after all .	1
memory cards came exactly advertised they worked great . no read errors , very noticeable increased speed load time compared other card types .. would recommend anyone looking value pack memory cards because this well worth it	1
these best memory cards you get ps2 . only get this one or sony playstation 2 1pk memory card . rumors spread non-sony memory cards damage your ps2 lose saves you memory cards	1
ico game very different others . it focused puzzle solving short but unforgettable story mixed fantastic visuals audio . imagine what ico would if action incorporated into it , you would something like shadow colossus , ico prequel . sotc colossal achievement many different levels . presentation : you stand front deceased woman whose identity unknown told defeating 16 colossi roam land , you may able revive her ... but it may come price ! this sets up shroud mystery surrounds sotc you start your journey . you given nothing but bows arrows , sword , your trusty horse agro . graphics : land sometimes colorful , but it supposed desolate so you won't see much life here . real kudos goes animation occurs during boss bottles . different motion blur affects really bring game new level realism . agro animation also cinema-worthy well . gameplay : meat potatoes sotc gameplay . ride your steed direction colossus begin battle . you 2 bars , grip strength health . grip determines how long you hold things , such colossi themselves . best part gameplay isn't your hands but your mind . each colossus puzzle must solved . it determining it weak spot , or even how get thing . colossus so varied each one keep you guessing what next . while it hard , it one funnest experiences you've ever . audio : some same tracks repeated throughout here , but they never grow old . music seems match mood . when you've just met colossus you'll hear soft music while you figure out what . then music rise you mount beast . all pieces here sound good great pieces . overall : when you've beaten it picked your jaw off ground surprise ending , it not over yet . you time attack mode hard mode which used collect few unlockables . while such modes seem trivial me , i mention this extremely fun experience , so even i go through it again . this absolutely no-brainer , get shadow colossus now	1
right , just so everyone knows , i never played this game , however , i think you should read this . i bought fable , found my computers graphics card not compatible it . it good enough but not supported , so avoid this i suggest checking support section website before you buy check your card compatible . they actually put list cards site , i assume this problem not uncommon so i advise you check this before buying game . just thought you should know	1
first things first , there mute button this unit . if user taps power button , sound mute off . i'm guessing previous reviewers who complained there no mute button either didn't read instructions or couldn't figure out product three buttons it ( power/mute , volume up volume down ) . second , this best way use xbox communicator when you logitech wireless controller . it works well , i noticed no sound quality decrease regular xbox communicator	1
grand theft auto series playstation 2 gone hand hand , which each game debuting ps2 before it travels other consoles . all changed release last year side story , grand theft auto : liberty city stories . this game , designed take advantage psp hardware , impressive technical feat , managing pack lot what made " big " gta games so memorable . but it fell short few key spots , most notably story , characters , series ' biting sense style satire . stuff easy overlook when you could carry liberty city around your back pocket . but ps2 , where you compare it directly three grand theft auto games appeared there , whole package significantly less interesting , even considering ps2 port budget price . not much changed , so if you've already played this psp , there not much reason take ps2 version . game got slightly longer draw distance playstation 2 , streets look like they might few more people them . but neither these things dramatically changes game , they can't save game otherwise murky visuals often poor frame rate . but it also controls little better ; right analog stick back effect , you've got all camera control other buttons you're used hitting ps2 . it neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy , but if you didn't play it psp , liberty city stories ' $20 price tag just right . just don't go expecting anything approaching grandiose nature gtaiii , let alone bigger , crazier vice city or san andreas . if you've already played it psp , well , there little reason play it again , because this same game , multiplayer modes stripped out . return liberty city , new york-themed locale first made famous back grand theft auto iii , liberty city stories all retreading through well-worn territory . if you still remember streets liberty city , you'll see plenty same spots here . but game designed less powerful psp , you'll probably notice liberty city stories much smaller scope than what we've seen series more recently . missions , which grew epic proportions san andreas , much shorter feel pretty meaningless lcs . there plenty moments where you'll complete mission immediately think , " well , least i'll never again . " story , however , biggest casualty . liberty city stories tells tale one toni cipriani , regular-type mob guy who good deed head leone crime family , salvatore leone . toni go away awhile , but heat died down , he back job liberty city , maintaining his loyalty sal while wiping out family enemies droves way . you ascend become salvatore right-hand man , you'll start finish gang wars other mafia types , few triads , yakuza ... pretty much all usual suspects present . if you're familiar various mafia presences over course past three gta games , you'll recognize few names faces here . but story stands alone doesn't require you remember various cast members . that good thing , because mafia characters other gta games largely forgettable . game storyline really isn't up par console installments series , because very little actually happens . even potential plot points squandered , like when toni finally becomes made man but bad cutscene doesn't actually show ceremony . game mission path doesn't deviate into crazy territory , most characters fairly lifeless . there no enigmatic weirdos like truth , crazy hippie san andreas , or steve scott , porno director vice city , break up heavier-handed mafia tasks . this dulls game personality , preventing its characters events becoming memorable we've come expect gta games their excellent storylines .	1
my experience developer tri-ace games dates back original playstation era star ocean : 2nd story . like most gamers this side world , this probably one first tri-ace titles created enough buzz form niche fans . other game , which credited simular yet even bigger buzz , original valkyrie profile . unfortunately , yield initial pressing run game so low ( so tri-ace wouldn't lose much if game didn't sell or catch ) time i heard hype surrounding vp wanted give game try it much too late ... copies game selling astronomical prices e-bay much like how sealed copies final fantasy vii selling now . because this i ecstatic when sequel - which this case actually prequel - announced so i could finally experience what i missed out first time one form or . granted , vp2 not complete carbon copy original , but majority gameplay elements cross game/generation gap , so essence this game should probably give you idea what original itself like . so , would i say i blown away or impressed what i missed out missing original vp ? not really . start , game simply beautiful . there some dazzling effects , leaves grass waving breeze various types weather pounding some locals . this what one should expect last generation ps2 title . sure , every once while battle camera might clip some polygons so it looks like your characters standing air , but so minor it doesn't matter . only gripe i i wish characters weapons changed depending what they currently equipped . however , since character designs so dependant default look weaponry , above simply wouldn't work very well . combat valkyrie claim fame , much like it other tri-ace games like star ocean . this good thing , considering amount time you'll spend battle mode leveling up game massive number characters ( which only handful actually involved story , others just seem there ) . quick glance , battle system seems button mashers dream , but like good 3d fighting series ( soul caliber or tekken ) those who know what their doing always get further or less difficulty things difficult enough . other combat related issues also sprout up : reviving ally requires you near ally body status effects so not your friend - especially when whole party inflicted once ( especially poison ) * shutter * . fun combat , there quite few hitches aware , such wasting ap dash getting nowhere because your party caught edge " something " environment or when party members become separated same reason , limiting your attack options until you take time go back get them . this becomes especially aggravating when you're trying finish battles quickly efficiently possible receive experience crystal bonuses . change 2d fighting environment vp 3d one vp2 works , but above issues make you yearn 2d battles original which would probably devoid these problems . game skill system area initially seems interesting clever but quickly becomes quite cumbersome . you'll form rune words your equipment accessories unlock new " potential " skills . note word " potential " previous sentence . unlocking new skill doesn't grant character skill automatically - only though battle skill used permanently learned . first glance this good thing since it prevents abuse ( think ffix skill system here ) , but player then quickly finds out it " may " ( well , usually ) take long learn said skill . instead awarded set amount points towards your skills after enemy defeat like most normal rpgs , percentage earned towards potential skills based average level your current party enemy(s ) . because this you'll constantly seeking out stronger stronger enemies you'll hardly ever find " undeniable great place " level up . you'll also contending never ending equipping unequipping equipment while doing this often means your party usually far wearing strongest available equipment all times - something usually given most rpgs . traversing dungeons probably most noteworthy aspect vp2 after battle system . first few complete cakewalk teach you ropes , later ones really test you sanity your brainpower . correct sealstone usage photon know-how go long way towards completely clearing them all their contents . kudos tri-ace awesome auto map feature - features like this need become industry/genre standard ! sound department , motoi sakuraba makes rather subdued yet solid entrance , seeming ditch his rather unique yet unorthodox style composing . it not until much later until you hear piece you know " yeah , that sakuraba , no doubt " . voice-overs good , but same time just few tiers above decent . valkyrie profile 2 also falls victim problems prevalent other tri-ace games . some moments unbalanced gameplay creep up player difficulty goes up few notches without much warning . story once again slow start ( this even surprise anymore tri-ace games ? ) , some story twists you see coming mile away ( one revelation end chapter 3 so freaking obvious ! ) . all this said valkyrie profile 2 worth playing if you've never experienced vp ? yes . however , now experienced it , i honestly think i could waited price drop instead buying it day it came out . despite this , i still look forward playing re-release original psp .	1
after my little brother lost my original copy i buy new one i am so glad i . i love game it so much fun play . like all final fantasy game graphics amazing gameplay	1
first off , let me say most part , katamari damacy amazing game . if you don't know story behind it , well , it wasn't thought up game designers that why it so original . game ideas came lady who didn't even like video games , they used her ideas make it . world where if you've played one rpg , you've played them all , if you've played one shooter you've played them all , etc . katamari damacy huge breath fresh air , i'm glad it popular . music strangely catchy , it great sense humor , attention detail absolutely astounding ( ton work must went into this game ) , it surprisingly very addictive fun . fact , unless you've actually played this game , you won't understand how fun addictive it . show me many games i say " i'd like " or " i wouldn't like , " but katamari damacy game you actually play understand . there even 2 player mode where you compete against friend ! you roll around " katamari " ( ball stuff ) pick up more more stuff automatically sticks your katamari . bigger your katamari gets , bigger stuff you pick up ! if this sounds stupid you , there reason : you haven't played it yet . trust me , it rocks ! while katamari damacy looks like kid game ... it not . there too much strategy , too much nuance here young minds . other hand , younger kids play chess , so .. maybe . but generally kids play stuff like halo 2 , requires little thought . my complaint level 4 . i've tried 10 times beat this level what i see , i don't think i ever able , so me game stops here . it 10 minute time limit , closest i've got 73 cm ( i need get 1 ) . i'm not gaming genius or anything , but i'm least average gamer regularly play online against other gamers very well . my opinion , they really " dropped ball " this level such strict requirement . honest , i'm really surprised anybody beaten this level , so little time . how many more times should i try ? 5 ? 20 ? 100 ? it disappointing . maybe " me my katamari " more gaming friendly ? thing , view screen isn't quite big enough . it very easy lost , so little view . you can't change camera angle , you only turn around . it would probably better bigger camera view camera changes angles automatically . also , controls turn around " charge " too difficult . turn around you press l3 r3 same time ... why not just us press button ? charge , you flip analog sticks up down really fast . too much trouble feature that pretty useless anyway . why would you want " run " when you'll just run into something anyway ? game consists lot moving back forth side , you don't need move forward fast . so it not perfect game , but it very impressive nonetheless .. i just wish i could play rest it . :(	1
so , these little fellas inside my computer . they run around all day shouting , " doodlee-doo ! doodlee-doo ! " i'm thinking they're up no good . i'm thinking they're plotting against me . but i can't turn them off . they say if i then evil befall me . caution ! beware	1
this well pu t-t ogether game lots fun play . you'll want play it again soon you finish it . i'm not big star wars fan but i nuts this game . this first rpg i ever tried once i got over fact " i not doing fighting " , i really liked it . i highly recommend this game unless you already weak relationship your wife/kids ( who you won't seeing much ) or if your boss hates you waiting you come late bleary-eyed so he pink-slip you	1
i don't really review games , because videogames nothing much talk . but anyway , these obe star reviewers all idiots . okay so sometimes idiots who play this game ten hours day idiots also , but that not point . people who write one star reviewers all stupid fragile hilary clinton supporters ans support stupid dumbf *** jack thompson . freaking imbeciles . okay now , this game rules . this game kciks beacuse i anything i want . if i want race car , blah blah blah . i just wanted top get myu point across one star reviewers . if you don't this , get it , i don't care how , but get it . remember , most people who write crap probally actually never tried it or stupid like jach thompson	1
you might guessed , this cool game i played arcade . it rocks ! time crisis 2 wonderful but this just outstanding . i mean , it cooler graphics , more usable weapons(including grenades ! yowsers ! )better sound effects above all such terrific explosions , shot hits , music gameplay it makes this best time crisis game i've ever played my whole , entire ( beep)ing life ! when i played this arcade , i tons tons fun . why you think i put five stars fun rating ? make this game even more enjoyable , i used fact i am lover animals good people , most especially lions , tigers , jaguars sexy women all sorts . i imagined those kinds innocents mentioned threatened , enemy game poacher slime threatening them(as you know , i not only love big cats , all cool animals decent human beings , i also hate , hate , hate poachers ! )and i hero sidekick who meant save women three large cat races . needless say , every time i killed enemy , bullet or grenade , i let loose words : " go hell , poacher scumbags ! " which course made game all more enjoyable , saving lives which i imagined either big cat species or beautiful woman . anyway whether you imagine this or not , this game best , coolest most fun time crisis ever made if you like shooting games or video games general matter , you must either play this arcade(like me)or if you got ps2 , buy it enjoy ! i'd say it rivals masterpiece silent scope , it so perfect	1

i just received this game yesterday i've already put few hours worth time into it . you can't help but notice rockstar trademark graphics intro . although controls character movements i think improved over san andreas controls movement . i found it challenging balance time this game . clock moves pretty fast , you run around finding challenges well watching clock make sure you aren't truant class or trespassing night when you're supposed bed ! you also really watch out prefects , which way , same term used harry potter . maybe it british thing ? i disagree one reviewer saying jimmy not bully . he isn't like other bullies , but he win respect others ( gta style ) protecting beating up bullies . so basically jimmy bullies bullies . breaking into lockers , running errands underpriveleged , flirting girls , getting good grades class , riding around skateboard , one my favorites dodgeball gym class ! these all things i've come across first few hours play ! what next ? get this game ! it vast array ecleptic gaming skills entertainment styles , you won't regret it ! if you also looking completely original game , graphics like i've never seen before i noticed alot bully buyers get okami , which i also , like no other game graphics-wise . very artistic those who girlfriends get tired watching you play same ol . it pleasing eye . very artistic original .	1
hilarity , adventure , wit fun this game nothing shy stupendous ( amazing great , marvelous ) . it certain nostaglia it new twist adventure/puzzle genre . think all games consumed our time back day such king quest , police quest , leisure suit larry put it tune trials , evidence investigation hints rpg , text adventure anime you'll land phoenix wright . it concept seem retro but it really like nothing you played before . star this show phoenix wright , lawyer who new scene must prove worth fey co law offices . his first case , you must take murder case defendant lawyer . court , you prove court defendant ' not quilty ' cross-examining witness testimonies . your object find faults contradictions their testimony referencing evidence prior statements . you ' press ' them everything they say make them open up more their testimony or get them confess more information . game doesn't stop there though , after winning your first case you go also investigate crime scenes , talk witnesses find your own evidence your next case . think law order but you handling both sides coin . sure , there detective but he bit slow witted quick come mis-conclusions . where you come , further investigate all missing gaps detective doesn't fill , use finding investigation prove your defendant innocent later court provide court clarity what actually happened . it plays like puzzle/adventure you must find clues evidence present them correct times ( object testimony , prove contradiction or trigger event investigation ) order progress through game . these items stored your court record . this game plays more like interactive comic book definitely not bad thing . most your time spent reading text , i would say this takes up 75% game . this doesn't hurt game score any because 1 ) game great story intriguing around every corner 2 ) interaction characters oft times funny not all dry . it reads like quality script written comic book or tv show . following 25% interaction , ability choose right option or present evidence right moment game . this interaction goes seamless story fits appropriately ds . stylus greatly utilized presenting evidence out your court record exploring crime scenes . there good reason why this makes most people top ten ds list . graphics : 3.5 out 5 . although this game only consist anime-esque stylings still life characters only slightly animated amongst static backgrounds , graphics still help carry story . it looks like makings slightly animated , interactive comic book . character art well drawn each character changes looped animations based their current mood . however , graphics could easily shown lesser system such gba . perhaps graphics revamped enhanced slightly ds version . only real thing separates it gba title its use stylus its length . sound : 4 out 5 , good use sound effects use music add suspense drama game . gameplay : 5 . story : 5 . replay value : 3 . overall : 4.5 must ds owners	1

boy , folks ea really outdone themselves this time . just when i thought 2003 greatest ncaa arcade game ever ea releases ncaa 2006 . this blows 2003 out water . i never knew it could sooo much fun cpu complete 80 yard td pass every single time . nor i know bomb most acurate pass game . who needs realism football sim when you just bomb ball down field it target every single time . this game punishes you trying play like real football game , so why not just bomb it every time . if your receiver drops wide open 5 yard pass , just means he wants you throw it 60 yards down field he'll much better chance catching it . where else you find game where qb constantly break tackles , spin one foot throw perfect spiral 40 yards down field right target ? its game !! wow !! i love how rb break 7 tackles there way 81 yard td run . oh yeah those safeties beasts . they apparantly very strong gravitational pull which causes your te ol completely ignore d-linemen linebackers run block safeties who not even play . every safety should nfl if they able . wow ! oh don't forget kickers . only arcade game mid 70 rated kickers drill 50+ yard fgs against wind 10 yards spare every single time . if you don't believe this great arcade game , check out scoring my latest game !! sexton threw 6 picks , yet still composure throw 6 td passes nearly 500 yards only 13 passes . wow , it really game !!!!

good comfortable controller ( better than n64 ones ) . it works much better than 3rd party controller , such madcatz . if you plan , or played " super smash brothers melee " (great game ) you notice how much easier it pull-off moves nintendo brand controller . it worth extra money , no-matter what it says third party company package ( dont fooled third party controllers extra button : " " button , it nothing because nintendo brand controller doesnt one developers design games according nintendo brand controllers ) . i never use my cheap madcatz controller ( madcatz controller often malfunctions well ) , this one much better , black goes everything . my rule thumb : nintendo brand game accessories more reliable , longer lasting , eye appealing overall better than third party distributers . * please vote yes if i helped	1
this truly good system . iv'e sat it , dropped it , kicked it , thrashed it , it still working fine . i consider buying psp first but then i thought , i ipod nano , dvd player , laptop . i didn;' see point 2 above . also , honsetly , who would want go web slow psp . you imagine how hard it type !! anyway , games i recommend nds mario kart ds , animal crossing , megaman battle network five , people reall hard core gamers , spiderman . ( this extrmeley har game trust me)also , i find picto chat quite usless . 33ft range isn't enough . also , i reading psp reviews 85 percent them said psp more mature gamers . what got me alot kid reviews saying . all these kids playing rated games sorta scary , but that just my opion . also if you " fat " ds , dont buy ds lite . thres no need unless your eyesight bad . all it brighter screen sleeker design . so it not werth it . once again this only my opion , im just giving my advice . wifi feature pretty cool . i am aware psp this too way . anyway , mario kart ds great job usuing wi-fi . feeling sitting your room playing people across world this handheld quite extroindary feeling . well , all all , if you really need gaming device good grapghics multi media features get psp . but im warning you it very very fragile . if you music device computer just want good gaming system great games very durable , get nds . they both good systems just think what you need system , you want gaming device , or multimedia device . its your choice end . i hope this review helped , i just want make your shopping tad bit easiers . cheers , hisham amery	1
classic final fantasy games ( 1-3 [ not 6 ]) notorious their difficulty . this not hold true until you reach center moon . then , you find yourself guzzling elixirs , potions , ethers just kill one monster . example , behemoths ( found past b5 center moon , bahamuts cave ) counter every spell attack brutal 2300 hit one party member . most boss fights ( asura , bahamut ) tough monsters ( behemoths , wicked masks ) gimmick fights . bahamut actually one easiest fights game , just cast reflect all your party members . let me reinstate what previous reviewers said this game+ crisp graphics+ great music + sound+ fun+ more once you beat game- somewhat short ( beat eg zeromus 18hrs 42mins)- very difficult- prepare grind 10-15 levels once you reach center moon ! i enjoyed this , you bet i'm getting ff3 ds . great blast past , must-buy any final fantasy fan , rpg lover , or gba owner	1

there lot different opinions madden nfl 07 swirling around so i figured i get it well . my money , just new football game worth it . seeing how madden now only football game available year year , if you don't like madden brand video games then i feel so sorry you . however , i think this great installment . no means this best released but there no doubt it lot fun . madden 06 ? you basically 07 . not lot changed last year . few things running options ( juking whatnot ) moved right joystick , 50 yard dash training camp , new camera angle your superstar linebacker . also , while i've only played quarter exhibition game lot superstar games , i still yet hear john madden . i don't know if he not this game or not , but if he isn't just makes no sense . pros:it still maddenlinebacker viewoverall superstar : hall fame featurehaving all big name rookies kind nicecons : it hasn't changed much last yearyeah , that my only big complaint . i can't help but love this game though . if you're looking save money then there no huge reason buy this unless you play leinart , young , bush , williams , then all means check this out . however , if not those guys doesn't bother you then you really don't need this year game	1

i remember when " doom 3 " first came out there lot hype internet . people claiming it would blow away release " half-life 2 " id new engine , etc . etc . etc . unfortunately , " doom 3 " rather standard shoot-'em-up . it fun little while , but it lacks originality inventiveness games like " half-life 2 " ( which amazing ) . " half-life " kept me engaged because terrain changes ; characters change ; so . " doom 3 " it basically just lot walking around through dimly-lit corridors . monsters jump out you kill them . it fun while but then it becomes tiring - much like haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight . furthermore graphics engine really isn't what everyone made it out . i just bought new pc this year it runs this game very well maximum settings - gameplay isn't choppy or anything . but even full potential graphics i think they're just " ok . " shadowing brilliant but textures average some characters cut-scenes downright laughable - one commanders early looks like character " avp 2 , " game came out 2001 ! in-game play much better - characters look more realistic - but i wonder what rush cut-scenes . one would think they'd spend more attention detail these . overall i admit while i found this fun times it gets tedious after while . i mean , gimmick flashlight annoying ( someone else pointed out ) - i think beginning it okay but they should planted upgrade early game , such helmet flashlight attached top ; or nightvision goggles last minute or two before they recharged ; because dropping your flashlight picking up weapon while you're shot enemies annoying . reviewer pointed out , pda gimmick gets old fast . overall this moments absolute brilliance but i felt like so much more could it . they should abandoned concept " alone dark " throughout entire game bit more it - i would loved explored martian planet more or even levels don't look exactly same . because repetitive nature game ultimately what sinks it . it good , but i think " half-life 2 " far better graphics engine hl stunning , even two years later	1
i looking black white deluxe version ( expansion pack ) came across this . i little hesitant purchasing it because one reviews ( computer dude ) said none games activation numbers . let me start saying this not true . this little four page installation manual tells how install all four games ( really five including black white expansion pack ) back all five activation numbers . i installed black white without any problems up half night playing it . only difference these games originals all documentation ( manuals etc . ) except four page installation guide , game cds . so if you looking couple these games this great deal information computer dude claiming their no activation numbers inaccurate	1
i've playing ncaa 2007 few weeks now , here my thoughts : 1 ) game simply good job capturing feeling it sport any other game . anyone who big-time sec game understands stadium shake . 2 ) i not play " career " mode , i simply prefer control over whole program . 3 ) gameplay very strong , anyone who played ncaa or madden past notice tightening up controls . 4 ) i personally not like first person camera special teams plays , it makes it frustratingly difficult return kicks . 5 ) likewise i could without auto slo-motion " key " plays . it absolutely destroys flow play highlight catch or hit during play . ea , that what replay . 6 ) system annoyingly apt hit me unsportsmanlike conduct penalties , not just td but simple catches or defensive plays . 7)you now more control over recruiting in-season recruiting , including mulitple pitches on-campus visits . 8)after all these versions ea come up new set unlockables . changing logo , or sponsor (!) not new unlockable make	1
splinter cell first series three amazing games ( date ) . it available xbox , ps2 , game cube , pc game boy advance . set 2003 , you play sam fisher , elite operative gathering intelligence third echelon , top secret initiative nsa ( national security administration ) . you work alone during your missions support remote team who periodically feed you info guidance throughout missions . if you caught enemy , your country deny your existence any connection you . like sliver glass - small , sharp , nearly invisible - you splinter cell . splinter cell now highly renowned ground-breaking game introduced world true stealth gaming . light shadows key elements game play vital role your success . unlike most action games where you quickly run around guns blazing , splinter cell you must tactical your approaches slip your enemies if you never there - creeping around shadows best approach . however , sometimes you seen no choice but eliminate any witnesses . after doing so you should then elect hide bodies shadows not alert anyone your presence . causing panic easily create real mess sound alarms quickly end your mission - bad way . this play light dark very well executed amplifies immersive qualities game . even now , years after its ' initial release , splinter cell still worth picking up playing . fact , i originally purchased splinter cell game cube take advantage exclusive connectivity features which enable player use sticky cams tactical map displayed their gba , which very neat way . only after playing two following splinter cell games ( pandora tomorrow chaos theory ) xbox i then decide buy xbox version original splinter cell . i played through all missions again , this time including exclusive downloadable maps xbox live , found it even more enjoyable than fist time around . splinter cell truly classic timeless game should every gamer collection .	1
theres alot rpg out there ppl stumble or find some research this would one those . finding it , i found myself one happy camper when i got it got it going . you play this very long time , or you play this short amount time , but im positive if your into dungeon crawl types you love this one ! my favorite part this particular game not key chart sitting front me all times glance remind me what key what . i hate games so many controls you cant just play them w/o memorizing so many key strokes even move much less play . there also active forums lots info this game even though its not well known game here usa . all all i recommend this highly . great graphics but you wont high end rig run it . there already addition this out , replay value high this one	1

what i mean here 3 half stars which my little scheme things means good pretty clearly outweighs bad i recommend it bit enthusiasm . 4 star games very rare me this game made good run it . i can't even imagine 5 star game . i've come think there too many inherent problems games 5 stars . anyway , ahem , this gun . very nice game i looked forward lot . i played it just after it came out hopefully havent forgotten too much i t.t he positives : graphics ! this seems bit controversial some people complain them , but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism detail . gun detail not like , i dont know , half life 2 or something . i didn't repeatedly go " wow , unbelievable todays technology ! " but i really enjoyed them . they pretty look , they set scene well they extremely refreshing- bright , colorful , open western vistas instead dark , gloomy , tense , industrial , claustrophobic filled horror creatures commandos like , i don't know , 95% all shooters . it lovely ride my horse around spotting buffalo hot springs such . i appreciated quite bit . difficulty : well , i can't remember if this game difficulty levels . but i like difficulty levels make bee line easy choice ! i not like dying ! even if i reload right away , i am not too great these games . well , so , up until last part game ( more later ) i no real problems generally felt clever talented but not coddled unchallenged . poker too easy though i could not get hunting gave up it part way through ( i thoroughly completed everything else ) . characters/voice acting : pretty good characters helped superb voice acting . i don't want any spoilers here so i'll just say quality characters let down storyline , but i still liked them . they looked pretty good me . gameplay : it quite fun varied . it some best bullet time ever ( called quickdraw or something ) . i loved how you could flick target target single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised speed mowing down enemies way made it less ridiculous i beating 11 people gunfight . horse riding very well it nice pony express . i liked poker it though found it bit limited , both ranching mining really nice helped fill out world variety things you . length : i may exception , but vast majority games go too long me . feel them things i them become redundant i don't finish , so i like gun seemed manageable . most part i pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things little too cut dried , like way you get every upgrade possible . negative : story : it should gone bit lighter , i mean , it seemed think it some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games not capable pulling off anything nearly sophisticated . they just too much their plate vis vis gameplay choice . cutscenes acting nice , it started solidly , but storywise it progressively deteriorated , or i guess completely unable fufill its set up . it gets little hard discuss without spoilers but , well , more romance would nice boss battle goes not just difficult me ( remember how i hate ! ) , but it irritatingly stupid , senseless reality game . conclusion : wow , only one big negative , but huge , long , ending boss battle really bugged me . really , good game though . oh , way , i pretty midlevel computer ( fading fast ) didn't any real technical problems , maybe couple ugly frame slowdowns , but mostly it smooth . that just , you know , what that worth . anyway , if some what i am talking makes sense you go try this game out	1
man , i am sick people mentioning violence cursing sex that this game . duh !!! this redundant saying sun bright hot . i don't even see what big deal . gore it isn't exactly realistic ( blood splattering gushing isn't great-looking ) i've seen much more " disturbing " games . violence almost like cartoon violence some ways . it isn't really big deal . there some very moderate cursing there some sex . yes , you pick up hookers . no , you don't see any action . yes , there strip club sluttily dressed women but these aren't exactly real-looking people . just lighten up . if you don't want your 8-year-old exposed it then don't buy it him but i better not see your hipocritical ** buying him or even pg-13 movie ! this really no different than watching some pg-13 movies any movie . fact , they may worse . i think you should relax if kid 12 that generous . now enough bulls**t ! game ! it great . what else you expect ? you could play this game hours never get bored . you whatever you want : steal car , speed around town , run over people , drive-bys , rob store , kill person no reason variety weapons , see how long you evade law , mission , sub-mission ( such paramedic ) , pick up hooker get some health , etc . etc . etc . there plenty side missions those what'll take up most time , not any storyline or asset missions . hardest ones paramedic , vigilante , firefighter , brown thunder pizza boy missions far i am concerned because there you time limit if you're vehicle blows up you're f**ked start all over again . you'll take long time getting all hidden packages , rampages all stuff but that not so hard because it not something that really " hard " . just tedious . there also some race missions tough but they some persistence . controls great . driving excellent so on-foot ones . auto-aim works easily enough though you sometimes target ones you don't want , but you get around this without too much difficulty . boats harder control though helicopters tricky . but boats worst since they habit over-accelerating over-steering . but controls general good enough so you pretty quickly get used them , before you know it , you'll cruising around town like pro . graphics quite nice . cars very realistic-looking . fact , after playing this if you go outside look real cars they'll remind you ones game . you'll even feel like driving them like you game ! but obviously you won't because you're not stupid f**ked up like guy who killed those cops then like p**sy blamed game making him it . don't listen those a**holes . it all bunch crap . only complaints i would people . they could look better blood could little better too , especially when it gushes someone you shoot . i would like see more blood too . camera angles main flaw game . sometimes you'll want it point different direction so you see what you're shooting . problem when you're helicopter . get screwed up you turn around angle catch up you . foot if you're not auto-targeting you you button adjust camera angle where you're facing but when you're vehicles not so . only time this really problem though chopper . sound excellent . even sounds themselves nice . you great voice acting some well-knowns even nonwell-knowns , but it all fantastic . dialogue fantastic too . you'll hear people street talking amongst themselves they'll stuff such tell you move , sometimes not so nicely , when you park car middle flow traffic . they'll scream plead their lives or even taunt you when you point gun them or attack them . your character even say things people , like when he steals their car or kills them , such , " my need greater than yours , " or , " it only money . " it great ! humor value this game top-notch lot sounds i mentioned above , well how fun it kill people whatever reason , if there reason , but also radio ! i can't believe more people aren't commenting this . this one highpoints this game just like gta3 , only this time they don't make up all their own songs , which bad or good depending how you look it . i love cruising around town listening kchat , vrock or vcpr , latter which funniest all . i usually listen these because they funniest ( talk radio obviously funnier than music stations even though there talk dj call-in listeners commercials ) because i like rock music they play actually good bands like iron maiden anthrax . they make up some their own music . i know they make up in-game band , which you actually missions , called love fist , group drunken scotts . but radio hilarious , not just talk radio but commercials especially well ("' knife after dark'--rated ' retarded ' . " ) game some flaws but overall it d**m near perfect . makers game basically took all they gta3 added it but failed really fix these few flawss i mentioned . but they're nothing comparison overall fun this game provides . there least over 100 hours , even if you're familiar over-all gameplay gta3 , if you try 100% or least something close ( i no idea how i'm gonna complete all those submissions ) . look , this one easiest decisions you'll ever make your life . just buy d**m game . if that not enough convince you , one radio characters game , jeremy robar , says , " just listen these endorsements . remember , these people volunteered . they aren't paid much .	1

half-life 2 pc put x-box sounds like it should work . core gameplay still same good fun once you get few hours into it . graphics decent but won't blow you away like pc versian . so what problem it half-life 2 x-box just little watered down . well there one single problem really irritates me point i would give it three stars . l.o.a.d.i.n.g !!!! this game loads more than you actually play it . it simply ruins action ! your middle tense adrenaline pumped chase your really into it when it all suddenly stops game loads . loading times last seven thirty seconds it really just makes you want swear t.v. screen . half-life 2 x-box isn't bad game but it completley inferior p.c. problem which loading problems well . it possibly worth rental if sit through all constant loading but beyond loading issue it worth playthrough . there no multiplayer single player all your getting so don't buy .	1
reviewer below must some other conflict game , because i am currently running game iwd1 windows xp i make this post	1
like 90% people who played this game , my primary motivation playing through watch mini season 24 . story takes place during considerable gap time 2nd 3rd seasons show . actors show voicing their characters music script written guys who work real show , it should not too hard please me this game . respect , game fulfilled , but not exceed , my expectations . while i enjoyed watching this extra " day " , gameplay left lot desired . there quite bit variety , which nice , you get play almost every character show . there so many different types missions standard " get point point while shooting people " missions only made up 60% game . rest game involved driving , computer hacking , interrogating , sniping , such . this would really cool if all these missions actually fun . pretty much any mission involving driving sucked , since controls incredibly sloppy . interrogation kind fun first time , but it didn't need several times . there three or four different computer hacking missions got over over again , so they weren't much fun end game . rest game , i'd describe it mediocre . there wasn't anything spectacular gameplay ; there too many missions where environment so dark it impossible see where i going ; there no reason all there two missions involved shooting down helicopter . addition , there too many missions unnecessarily difficult , my opinion . one such mission , you playing jack you defend girl who defusing bomb . there basically endless supply terrorists who keep rushing out start shooting you , if girl takes any damage all she starts whining stops working . it wouldn't nearly so annoying if it weren't fact there doesn't seem any strategy whatsoever beating mission . i must made dozen attempts varying degrees success . i no idea what i differently when i finally beat it . pretty much any mission involves you protecting person extremely annoying , because person usually tend stand out open taking damage instead finding cover . despite fact your partner firing their weapon constantly , they never hit single enemy , so you take everyone out yourself . all , game worth playing through story if you're fan show . otherwise , you could find much better action games out there	1
purchase xbox console dvd movie playback kit matches region which you located . after you buy dvd kit put dvd infrared sensor into your xbox , dvd kit permanently codes your xbox based region your kit from(the region code dvd kit only written outside packaging kit ) . point forward , you only play dvd region xbox dvd kit , ofcourse , dvd carrying label ' all regions ' . you cannot play dvd region even if you later try using dvd kit other region your xbox . instance , if you us region 1 dvd kit you import dvd abroad , say , region code 3 , it not play your xbox console . but here how you change dvd region your xbox play it . 1-send your xbox console repair it re-adjusted play dvd desired region . you pay repair here even if your xbox still warranty period . 2-next , buy dvd kit sold desired region use after your xbox console repaired . here , you only play dvd this region , ofcourse , dvd carrying label ' all regions ' . it permanent change . thus your xbox console acts like ' region specific ' dvd player rather than ' region free ' dvd player . but all said , i no problems dvd kit . i sony dvd player but i find picture clarity better xbox . ( all above info procured xbox customer care departmen t.t o this end , i hold it correct )	1
early game you use pistol rifle take down some stormtroopers new republic you explore their base , no force powers . but events make turn worse you go luke request your lightsaber back . then you begin discover force powers you search out dark jedi/killer your girlfriend rest game . amazing graphics increddible duels , this game simply magnificent . plus multiplayer awesome ( especially when you play ctf give other team boat load storm troopers you your friend rebels one bot helping you against twenty or so stormtroopers makes game game you'll never want trade ! plus duels fun play again again . i would five stars but game two or three puzzles quite difficult . all all great game any starwars fan must own , any shooter fan really , if you like both , oooh you need it really bad	1
valkyrie profile rpg came out during later days psx . while it never achieved massive success , it went become rpg classic garnered very loyal following . fast forward 2006 , we see re-release this awesome rpg psp . however , don't make mistake writing this off plain old port . valkyrie profile : lenneth includes " new " high quality cg movies help immerse you story . graphics consist highly detailed sprites pre-rendered backgrounds ; when seen vivid psp screen , it just makes game look downright beautiful . some combos just awesome look . battle system mix real-time turn-based fighting surprisingly intuitive ; newcomers old pro no problem getting used it . first glance , it might look simple , but you progress through game , you'll find depth it makes it quite fun . main story , itself , very well developed ... even if this rpg doesn't follow traditional linear way telling it . one things i enjoyed most this game character " episodes " you see when you collect new soul help battle save valhalla . if you enjoy rpgs , or feel adventurous enough ... i highly recommend you buy this game . it definitely must psp game .	1
one main reasons i decided become gamecube owner due its ability play gba , gbc , gb games external source , television , projector , 5 " universal screen , etc . i could care less its inability play dvds because i already owned playstation 2 . then afterwards , i started using less game boy titles more game called super smash bros melee , which most my former floormates used play almost all time i would just stand there watch . system itself cube-shaped , hence name gamecube . like original xbox , it comes four controller sockets controller similar appearance , but smaller ( no , it not better than ps2 controller ) . like playstation 2 , it uses memory cards store data . unique gamecube handle back unit , making it easier carry . furthermore , it purchased variety colors : platinum , black , purple . other colors imported , though i would recommend finding store paint jobs . i'm giving this 8.3 /10 , but that only because north american , i can't help but feel somewhat cheated . whatever reason , when it comes video games their machines , us dwellers always deprived really neat things , like panasonic qs ( gamecubes built-in dvd players ) , gamecube/game boy player bundle deals , playstation xs , nes axe colors , tri-star adapters , game boy hunters , availability systems multiple colors , etc . interestingly enough , i've found this problem prevalent mostly nintendo sony systems . ( whoever said life isn't fair sure wasn't joking . ) if panasonic ever released us if this system lest available more colors here ( without import - unnecessarily tedious , complicated excessively costly procedure , way ) , then this probably could gotten something closer 5-star range , but all due respect , one would think nintendo would start showing little more consideration respect us americans than tha t.t he kab score : 8.3 super .	1
we bought this my 6 y/o daughter go x-box we bought christmas . we not owned game system except game-boy since original nintendo came out . this game fun us all . we all play same time , which makes some family fun . my daughter able play some alone without getting too frustrated well when we all play . personally i enjoy comedic elements well thought out . if you hard core gamer you probably get bored it quickly . it may not challenging you like . we gotten over half way through without cheat book , which amazing most games .	1

nancy drew : last train blue moon canyon ( 13)-before i begin ... my review spilt up into sections in-depth look topic . if you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't patience i would not continue reading , but if you want learn most product before you buy it you'll continue . -gameplay interfacethis point-and-click mystery , arrows hands simple easy use . they also made improvement arrows since last game . hands manipulate items or add them your inventory(toolbox ) . when playing game you also panel bottom screen including : inventory(depicted toolbox , which i think should backpack instead ) camera cell phone journal , help menu button ( other games coin purse when money used game ) . main menu pretty simple . however , loading saving game little clunky you can't delete saved games . it also prompts you your decision ; it makes saving/rewriting games take more than one click . this type game interface perfect , but i'll knock off star irritating save/load page . ****-plota fairly used plot this series , finding treasure . but her interactive made this treasure finding story little more interesting . jake hurly , miner owner custom-built train , falls love young french woman named camille way finding gold . camille later dies , jake possibly finds treasure but he nowhere found his now " haunted " train found out out nevada desert engineer dead . many years later , lori girard ( daddy little fame seeking , rich girl ) finds train puts it back into shape trip copper gorge , colorado . she invites infamous guests train find out what happened jake hurley where his mine using clues jake left train . pretty simple treasure story ( this series often uses story but different ways ) now turned into intriguing mystery , good work her interactive . game also some side mysteries like lori getting kidnapped someone throwing emergency brake(both happen publicity stunts ) . but you find who those things only minutes after each event happened . what i didn't like there not really culprit because there no crime committed . very end when crime attempted after you find out who culprit . jake hurley part plot fantastic but sub-plot(s ) weren't very exciting . ****-charactersi loved characters , but you couldn't really interact them much . lori girard one my favorite characters , i loved watching dumb blonde trying get publicity how she always kept forgetting nancy name . since lori hostess she probably main character . tino baldcucci great character well . he private investigator but all he really get such fame right place right time . he conceited lori , you'll probably interact him lot more than john grey . john grey first black male this series , he host ghost hunters , cable show verge cancellation ghosts . he pretty good character but not leading role unfortunately . then there charleena purcell romance novelist introduced nancy drew : secret shadow ranch ( 10 ) , who nice very smart . she process making her book that deadline , who you'll find out used one lori story ideas her latest book without permission . i like her better now then when she nd 10 , bad she no memory game . finally there frank joe hardy . these teenage brothers work american teens against crime ( atac ) who invited because their dad friends lori dad . boys nice enough invite nancy well . i personally liked this addition game because you get play frank short-order cook . they really don't much case , they just good source info . i am looking forward playing them more nancy drew : creature kapu cave ( 15 ) . i really didn't like how there not lot character interaction this game . but when you interact times it really fun . that something add nd 16 beyond . ****-setting graphicsi love train , feel so exciting . seeing scenery pass windows great . cars so detailed beautiful . i think my favorite place train projection car . later you stop copper gorge , little town colorado . there mysterious crypt museum/taffy shop cheesy but enjoyable . crypt small there wasn't much , but i mean real life all you crypts mourn . graphics great . very realistic . its amazing how much graphics this series keeps getting better better . this probably most unique setting series . i personally love trains , boats planes so this made me really happy . *****-puzzles/activitiesthe puzzles fairly easy . i liked how lot puzzles combined into one find where jake mine . what disappointing repetition puzzles . there four or five pipe sets you connect which got little annoying . you also retrieve lot items like gemstones , tools , duct tape , pen other stuff . i don't understand how they made finding gemstones easier than playing almost impossible game tino get simple pen . some puzzles unique , like camille doll sorting puzzle her favorite dance step , playing " camptown races " piano , using metal slugs mathematical way open doors scale . but some these activities needed no skill all like combinations , word search , two memory games . this game variety but also repeated some puzzles well which brought down its score . ***-endingonce you find out where jake mine your sent off there get head start " treasure " . you'd think after all puzzles you went through you would think finding treasure mine would somewhat harder than everything else . you open entrance , memorize couple things , follow some lizards then use info you memorized . not difficult if you smart . then you find " treasure " your so called " culprit " . you wouldn't know this person culprit when he/she finds you mine talks you , but then he/she loses trust you you get caved . then you get out(i thought this fun , felt like roller coaster ) stop " culprit " . i liked ending what treasure but getting through out mine relatively easy . although culprit kind obvious , i liked what culprit plan or goal . overall it good ending yet little easier than i thought it should . ****-overallthis one better nancy drew games out there . definitely one add your shelf . flaws this game don't affect game much they could if setting different . plot pretty good most puzzles fit into it . i enjoyed this game lot after i played it more than two times . i think any game needs played more than two times get full experience . some parts game really exciting compared other parts . repetition some puzzles isn't too bad . this game outstanding but there never going best nancy drew game . it really depends your opinion . add all these up divide 6 ... 4 *' ( gameplay interface)4 *' ( plot)4 *' ( characters)5 *' ( setting graphics)3 *' ( puzzles)4 *' ( ending) = 24 stars divide 6 ( categories ) = 4 starsthanks reading	1
i absolutely loved this game . i couldn't stay off my computer , it addicting . game long but puzzels clues really get you thinking , it very entertaining i would recommend it everyone who loves mystery . i can't wait until next one comes out	1
all you non-believers out there , buy this game ! i like you ... reading reviews , looking box various stores , pondering , considering , thinking myself , " should i buy this game ? " now i finally spent mere $20 played game , i am wondering why i didn't so sooner . avid playstation supporter , ( stood line hours paid over $600 my ps2 back day ) , this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment . cinematically driven storyline , supurbly coordinated character control , creative levels character design , great soundtrack , decent bosses , pretty cool power moves , , ( importantly ) , puzzles not overly frustrating point throwing your controller through tv screen ... except maybe climbing rotating spike columns . closing , all i gotta say same thing i said my first sentence this review ... buy this game	1
this game amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! only problem order get some achievments , you play it veteran mode . sometimes you near end level checkpoint occur right middle battle . one time i getting shot tank it saved game . only three shots kill you . i restart whole level it took me hour complete it .	1
very good overall graphic , voices good , sometimes funny , sometimes sarcastic . pc game should readme file gives maps , walkthroughs	1
thinking . analyzing . solving problems . reading . logic . these just some skills brain age help you develop ( or re-develop ) . no , it not resident evil or splinter cell . but it fun addictive ; it certainly challenging if not more challenging , it nice pallet cleanser plethora pure entertainment value games my kids i play . brain age bit advanced times my grade schoolers , but parts they get really help them develop skills they concurrently working school . big brain academy much easier ( not better ) alternative younger children . there daily training area gives your skills workout . there test area challenges you quickly accurately work through various tasks , then provides you calculation your brain age based how well you test . sudoku it own area train brain number logic . kids reading this no vote me death saying this , but this great game parents get their kids . it one only ones ( big brain academy other ) i never take away my own kids when they've misbehaved or simply just too much video gaming . they never complain . one word advice : brain age hard time recognizing " 8 " if you write it way you'd skate figure 8 ; it likes it better when you draw 8 two circles top each other . addictive fun . buy it .	1
this game very good . they only add coople people stoy line but cool . game folows movies well . you even blow up buildings . only thing i dislike this game littel repeditave . lastly , you get high speed cases cops	1
this game literally alpha omega its genre . storyline great , characters really good , freedom depth game almost unbelievable . planes , choppers , bikes , cars , you name it ... drug dealing , gun running , cop bribing , you name it . even still , this game 2 or 3 pretty big flaws . namely it not great graphically , but strong pc good graphics card , it hard really complain . what most bothered me half dozen or so missions , objective so poorly phrased so i ended up spending few hours trying wrong thing entirely ! i flying plane trying land it cliff instead hit marker thousand feet air ! directions mission said take it cliff so i ... also , some missions might take lot attempts before you succeed so patience . lame my last quasi complaint , i think storyline could longer ! i wanted see few more missions where carl wuzi fun after big heist i wish cj would definite resolution catalina . if anyone not planed any gta games before , i hadn't either , then this game might overwhelm you first couple nights , you really hate it ! but if you buy it , warned , this game take 2-3 weeks playing 6-8 hours day if you want get close 100% completion it addictive !!	1
i like gta series games this one great too . i turn up my settings max ( my computer over year old ) there no problems . kid reviewer claims he doesn't like " n/f bomb " . why this rated mature ( so he should not even playing it ) . give series taste some things cannot eliminated . this fun games just exploring city or completing missions	1
i unlike lot other people not buy this game when it first came out . my initial thought what squar thinking . i thinking this could nothing more than childs game . it wasnt until i talked number other people , right before kh2 came out i finaly listen all those people spend $20 get game , ( price game then , ) low behold , time i finished watching just opening scene i hooked . i played game what seemed like hours , ( it really only very long weekend . ) but game became so addicting i immediatly went out bought second one day it came out . story line par final fantasy , final fantasy vii , my two favorit games world . i would recomend this game anyone even slightes bit imagination . if you even dare dream you instantly love this game i . it well worth price , my only regret i not buy it sooner	1
while it shares name " chrono " many people think it horrible sequel , it fact not direct sequel like so many people think it . it very well rounded amazing game play , it follows up twenty years after fall lavos . keep mind when playing this game it chronological sequel rather than direct sequel so many people fail realize . while game numerous playable characters , it still maintains very good story , if you follow it closely , but times , become very confusing if you miss certain details . chrono cross net you around 30-40 hours gameplay , if you don't stop playing game extended amounts time , story just becomes completly amazing	1
if you ds owner , this game must-have . you not disappointed	1

i old skool ds , it ok . when they released lite , i skeptical it . it right after microsoft 360 scandal , i critical new technology . i wanted wait until it out few months pick one up , see if it any glitches . i'm glad i waited , because they released coral pink one ! i picked it up first day , it so adorable perfect . ability change light levels great , old ds hard play outside because you couldn't really adjust lighted screen . it soft pink color , glossy , tiny . i marveled it size compared old ds . it super hot . charger old ds not fit into ds lite , so if you old charger/old car charger it won't work . :( that not such big deal since it comes charger , but i kinda sad old car charger wouldn't fit . stylus better , soft rubber tip instead hard plastic one old ds . colors it amazing ! sound pretty loud , i find i don't it up very much hear it fine . i'm glad nintendo finally realized not every gamer d00d .	1

time , white only option . red would pleased my child more . i've found sp games which claim work wireless attachement , not work ( communicate ) ds games . but ds lite , its reasonable size , perhaps slightly larger buttons would nicer . now they offer pink black , which nice , but exchangable covers would nice . stylus just barely managable adult hands but work fine my child . screens bright no longer dimmable ( backlighting could turned off sp . one nice feature many games allow some amout co-play ds , even if your partner doesn't copy . stores like " gamestop " often kiosks allow you download demos different games . thats nice but you cannot keep demo thru power cycle , so that bummer . biggest pain yet i not found cable communicate ds lite sp ( one exist ds sp ) . oh , power supply cable different well . so , while less bulky better layout , ds lite steps you even further away accessories which worked sp ds ( first versions , not lite ) . such proprietary way . i'd really like see more adult software these things . they not far pda their audio recognition handwriting well	1

i got this x-mas i am huge spyro fan ! i started second one this now fifth release not counting gameboy games , second playstation 2 . last one , enter dragonfly wasn't so successful i feared there wouldn't ; but here it ! so many things added . buying items item shops , keychains keys open boxes , riding around professors new gadget ball , mini-games featuring not spyro , but his friends , etc . i kind miss flying spyro through rings speed race , but ... this new spyro clearly trying keep up newer platform games others seem enjoy , but luckily they kept things too hard you give up eventually you don't worry wandering around getting lost game . spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole , etc . he moves , he even meets little dragons like him- ember , flame . hard enough keep you playing get through challenge , but it never seems overwhelming . some mini-game second levels pain , but you come back later . strategy guide also helpful . this time , i don't think anyone complain spyro hasn't evolved or it same old thing , but spyro fans love spyro even if it same game but new adventures levels . he spyro ! hours enjoyment	1

month ago , i decided purchase my first game system since origional nes . i got ds , i must say i love it . somehow , they found idea seemed only gimmick ( dual screens ) turn it into something new fun . so far , i bought new super mario brothers , mario 64 ds , metroid prime : hunters , mario kart , japan-english dictionary program ( my main justification buying it first place ) . it great way kill 5 min . or kill few hours . once you get used using stylus , it becomes very natural . pros : -fun games all skill levels-nice styling-wireless connectivity-multiple people play same game off one card-bright screen good graphics-nice sound-long battery lifecons : -it fits little awkwardly my hands-you must buy screen protector ( stylus scratch up lower screen pretty badly)-in some games , stylus blocks your view different sections screen-the onyx black looks cool , but it gets extremely smudged up finger printsoverall : cons nothing compared pros . i highly recommend it	1
i think it great game , you play online other people around world . it good your're able play online , because after awhile easy level , gets boring . there different levels keep your intrest . campains really awsom . they never become boreing . mythology it real . this game real high , easily gets addictive . days fun .	1
i bought this game used wish i could find dozen more like it . i not like video game violence . i don't want kill people . but i love whole exploring world , figuring out puzzles angle . this game perfect . it attractive graphics , interesting premise good challenges . downside , it doesn't really call out replayed once you get through it once . which why it better buy it used ( why i wish they'd make sequel !	1
destroy all humans series brilliant . #2 , you now 1960s , hippies kbg agents all around you . if you didn't play original destroy all humans games , it involved grey , big-eyed aliens coming down earth 1950s . you ran around reading their thoughts , taking over their minds , slaying them . half fun incredibly funny sense humor game you interacted these humans 50s . destroy all humans 2 , we jump forward 1960s . president us ( jfk ) apparently female-loving space alien . kbg realize this try help out . next thing you know , aliens attack again - you're charge . you run around city maps , watching hippy chicks shout out " back off , pig ! " reading their minds . you mentally throw objects , take over bodies , much more . this game much more " active " than other adventure games - you hammer buttons get actions occur . you can't just passively press one button all set . graphics great . you really get immersed into world 60s , appropriate cars , hippy vans , murals painted walls . outfits people wear super . there traditional items collect , objectives achieve people slay . but again , most fun what you hear way . commentary hilarious . thoughts you overhear get you laughing out loud . if humans happy see you doing something " alieny " , you zap them free love - daisies dancing their brain , hippy music , soon distract them any troublesome thoughts grey aliens . even better , if you friend come visit , you o-o play ! now , there few anachronisms - didn't " love one you're " come out 1970 ? or maybe they're saying stephen stills got his inspiration hippy dude named freak . any case , i'm sure destroy all humans 3 set 70s , so we'll get enough soon enough . meantime , sure get your hands this version , help bring peace world	1

this well game , especially if you liked movie . characters voices behavior consistent movie there cute storyline game . there number stages you follow order , completing one move nex t.t here pretty small age window its good -- i'd say 6 10 . under 6 , stages too hard . over 10 they're sort easy not engaging -- you fly thru pretty quickly . it would bit better if you could jump around play " games " you enjoy instead go sequentially , but it still well worth buying	1
i find this game very indepth when it comes ability change formations plays just what you see . however , my major disappointment comes graphics . i understand ps2 doesn't not standards xbox360 , but this false advertising showing this very detailed game not showing which system this ran . i just hope when ps3 comes out , madden rerelease game it give xbox360 owners something whine . ea should more infomational giving what things look like consumer rather then just showing best picture they	1

i am going write this review mostly those familiar original disgaea . such i not get much into aspect gameplay system game aside things changed or important note . said , let begin . game begins land veldime , alternate world first game , where evil overlord named zenon hidden well , everyone . when he came into veldime however , he placed curse land changed all humans into demons . effects weren't all immediate some still several human qualities but if curse not reversed soon , there no turning back . thus hero adell ( oddly enough only person unaffected zenon curse ) sets out defeat overlord . opening there attempt summon zenon adell so he fight him , but it goes awry zenon daughter accidentally gets summoned instead . bound adell summoning pact she no choice but accompany him castle where he intends kill her father ( albeit not without scheming bit herself ) . nutshell , story good . nothing amazing but ample opportunity humor most come love original . only really new additions battles ability stack attacks , if you quick enough , throw diagnally . basis stack attacks after building tower aliies using lift command , person bottom tower still ability attack . doing so they begin passing enemy up tower everyone taking shot him then spiking him back ground . essentially , team attack up 10 characters . there updates dark assembly 6 factions senators introduced . it easier pass some bills if you lucky since quite often some senators show up vote drunk ( random vote basically ) or even asleep ( no vote all ) . perhaps most entertaining addition though felonies . you recieve felony things such power leveling , much hp/sp/mana , or even killing your own allies . benifit felonies top any stat boosts you may get , it easier pass proposals dark assembly , every felony character they gain 1% extra exp . this works all way up 300 felonies ( 300% exp bonus ) . game made all necessary additions make gameplay top original , however my opinion there feels like something missing . characters seem bit more " book " not wonderfully absurd original . voice acting isn't quite good first disgaea ( plus etna new voice actress ... ) . despite all however , game plays much better even looks bit smoother boot . all all it great game worthy sequel amazing game . while some may like changes characters others may not , there no denying core game much better than original keep you addicted just long , if not longer	1
i bought it my grandson not heard any complaints matter fact i haven't heard any noise he busy playing it	1
ok . now i know i'm not brightest star sky but whodathunk when game calls you ' blow ' , while stewing or boiling something , you actually supposed blow into mic ! i failed so many recipes just because i didn't know what when recipe called ' blowing ' . yes , i know what you saying , " you read instructions before you played game ? " course not ! this game appears juvenile primative , but it proven me least , most advanced nds game date . even if you don't enjoy puzzle games or you teen/mature gamer , this game worth owning just experience full capabilities your ds . i'd hate know what mature game developers doing this whole ' blow ' thing . yuck	1
boy , folks ea really outdone themselves this time . just when i thought 2003 greatest ncaa arcade game ever ea releases ncaa 2006 . this blows 2003 out water . i never knew it could sooo much fun cpu complete 80 yard td pass every single time . nor i know bomb most acurate pass game . who needs realism football sim when you just bomb ball down field it target every single time . this game punishes you trying play like real football game , so why not just bomb it every time . if your receiver drops wide open 5 yard pass , just means he wants you throw it 60 yards down field he'll much better chance catching it . where else you find game where qb constantly break tackles , spin one foot throw perfect spiral 40 yards down field right target ? its game !! wow !! i love how rb break 7 tackles there way 81 yard td run . oh yeah those safeties beasts . they apparantly very strong gravitational pull which causes your te ol completely ignore d-linemen linebackers run block safeties who not even play . every safety should nfl if they able . wow ! oh don't forget kickers . only arcade game mid 70 rated kickers drill 50+ yard fgs against wind 10 yards spare every single time . if you don't believe this great arcade game , check out scoring my latest game !! sexton threw 6 picks , yet still composure throw 6 td passes nearly 500 yards only 13 passes . wow , it really game !!!!

i recently bought this wheel local game crazy anticipation upcoming release gran turismo 4 so far despite few problems i've satisfied my purchase . good1 . great compatibility ps2 racing titles - it works basically all ps1 ps2 racing games - not just nascar games ( i've using it primarily gran turismo 3)2 . easy control customization . 3 . feels good your hands4 . well madethe bad1 . i wish adjustable lap rest could lock into place ( sometimes it slips back when your taking tough corner)2 . while pedals well made not use them carpeted surface - they slip . ( customize wheel like i , setting gas brake l1 r1 dont even bother pedels unless you better surface them)3 . wheel allows customization it sensitivity but i wish it could get little more sensitive then it ( more life like)overall it good solid purchase if you can't afford drop 150 bucks something top line . it definately alot better then using controller racing game .	1
this truly good system . iv'e sat it , dropped it , kicked it , thrashed it , it still working fine . i consider buying psp first but then i thought , i ipod nano , dvd player , laptop . i didn;' see point 2 above . also , honsetly , who would want go web slow psp . you imagine how hard it type !! anyway , games i recommend nds mario kart ds , animal crossing , megaman battle network five , people reall hard core gamers , spiderman . ( this extrmeley har game trust me)also , i find picto chat quite usless . 33ft range isn't enough . also , i reading psp reviews 85 percent them said psp more mature gamers . what got me alot kid reviews saying . all these kids playing rated games sorta scary , but that just my opion . also if you " fat " ds , dont buy ds lite . thres no need unless your eyesight bad . all it brighter screen sleeker design . so it not werth it . once again this only my opion , im just giving my advice . wifi feature pretty cool . i am aware psp this too way . anyway , mario kart ds great job usuing wi-fi . feeling sitting your room playing people across world this handheld quite extroindary feeling . well , all all , if you really need gaming device good grapghics multi media features get psp . but im warning you it very very fragile . if you music device computer just want good gaming system great games very durable , get nds . they both good systems just think what you need system , you want gaming device , or multimedia device . its your choice end . i hope this review helped , i just want make your shopping tad bit easiers . cheers , hisham amery	1
i put great deal interest my purchases . lot extra down-time work internet connection , i find myself reviewing everything before i buy it . only after i am very impressed convinced many positive reviews i take out my credit card . but this product , microsoft xbox360 media remote , one exception read many bad reviews deciding purchase it anyway . let me tell you ... this remote perfect if ... 1 . you would like one , easy-to-use remote control both basic tv xbox 360 doubles your dvd player . 2 . only buttons you would need tv : channels , volume ( tv speaker/output control only ) , numerical channel input , muting , * intput selection * ( yes , it switch your tv inputs ) , return ( toggle 2 tv channels ) , power . 3 . you not need specialized/advanced buttons found oem remote or advanced learning remote tv . 4 . you not need control a/v receiver , dvd player ( other than xbox 360 ) , or digital cable box ( tivo , dvr , etc . ) 5 . you budget but would still like quality remote . if you say yes all or most , then don't hesitate grab one these remotes . you completely satisfied . especially immediate access tactile dvd buttons versus 360 annoying on-screen dvd navigation . this feature it almost worth $30 alone . . . i also own logitech harmony 880 living room which i highly recommend anyone not fitting into catagory mentioned above	1
i grew up nes snes , so seeing these games new graphics some bonus features very nice surprise me . i just much fun playing through this game i playing ffii snes . fortunately there some improvements made dialogue , which made it much easier follow characters little deeper . square added some items extra equipment . also , you option switch all characters towards end game , which gives game new flavor . there some small bugs it , but most don't hurt gameplay too much . only downfall this remake they took away weapon-doubling cheat ... :-( thus , no more stacks 99 excallibur swords edge throw ..	1

this game so much fun ! i don't own it , but my friend , i want get it my birthday . but i think i should tell you why exactly anyone needs own this game ! first all , there 50 songs sing . some you unlock , but all you sing already available song . you're rated notes you supposed sing , if you don't exactly know lyrics , you just hum if you want . there character editor where you make your name , characteristics clothing character . or you pick already made character . thing which totally descriptive you pick body type your character : muscular , curvy , skinny ... works . there unlockables , too ! over course game , you unlock songs , outfits , accessories ! you also medly sing-off activities . medly when you pick 5 songs sing individual parts each them . sing-off ( i can't remember if actual name ) when you different types styles game . so you short song , medly , all kinds other things . then you see " who named champion karaoke ! " this game incredibly fun enjoyable , you see . if you buy it , i suggest you buy two microphones , then you sing duets ( also incredibly fun ) . this game perfect all ages ; my neighbors children age 7 he loves singing his heart out some his favorite songs . so take my word it , you thankful you	1
fable reached point where all rpgs dream going . it absolutely pinnacle adventure criteria . creators put you game , they make it fun , they make it interesting . fable game absolutely defines whole light side/dark side thing . because no other game concentrates subtle , small , important details leisures quite like fable . people learn adore you , people learn fear you , you life , you're not just some dummy string instructed exactly what . you hear ? fable life . it adventure . hint unrealism , just point make you eternally amused never decease until fat lady sings . battle system : 9 . it not guns , it not shoot'em up blowing their brains out . it classic swordsplay acrobatics , blocking , stabbing , leaping , lunging , ducking , dodging , running away , nothing say except ' die ' . not mention , you eat pie . it all realistic , hitting someone back , head , torso , all cause different amounts damage , there decapitations if you're lucky . game even keeps track your decapititations , how cool ? there archery , shoot someone arrow , further you pull back your arrow , more damage it , but less accurate it . you see ? realism . plain , clear simple , just like drive-thru guy ordered . leisure life : 9 . flirt chicks , flirt guys . ( eww .. ) flirt chickens . whatever . flirt anything face . get special haircut , facial hair , tatoos , some chicks find them attractive , some scary . some may think you're michael jackson sword get heck away you . hey , that life , right ? one first games ever allow you get married any woman , ( or man ) actually sexual intercourse them . yep , you heard me , sex . don't get cought up kinkiness boys , it lasts 5 seconds when screen goes blank , it only crickets giggles . buy house , rent out your house , live your house , steal anyone , kill anyone , picklock doors , fish , dig , kick chickens , abuse your wife , whatever you wanna , you probably it fable . main adventure : 10 . yes , this game not all just chicken-kicking . there plot . filled surprises , cliff-hangers , ultimate rewards . gameplay : 4 . quite possibly only downside this game . it too easy . i completed game naked didn't die once . there no way change your difficulty . this , however , make game much more fun you don't reload just get lucky order defeat enemy . but all sincerity , you may very well just whiz your way past this game mere hours if you put your mind it . but then again , why i am thankful all bonus material game , because actual game itself go pretty fast . it may seem confusing hard-to-get first , but all rpgs , so just stick it .	1
when i first started playing fable i amazed how much possibility there forge your own destiny . where one simple decision could alter your destiny good or evil forever . when you start out young boy who village burned , plundered , entire town murdered , you feel sorry boy his life taken him . then he become hero . you embark long journey make choices way you forge you own personal destiny . well written storyline back it up this game amplifies your freedom forge your destiny .	1
there lot different opinions madden nfl 07 swirling around so i figured i get it well . my money , just new football game worth it . seeing how madden now only football game available year year , if you don't like madden brand video games then i feel so sorry you . however , i think this great installment . no means this best released but there no doubt it lot fun . madden 06 ? you basically 07 . not lot changed last year . few things running options ( juking whatnot ) moved right joystick , 50 yard dash training camp , new camera angle your superstar linebacker . also , while i've only played quarter exhibition game lot superstar games , i still yet hear john madden . i don't know if he not this game or not , but if he isn't just makes no sense . pros:it still maddenlinebacker viewoverall superstar : hall fame featurehaving all big name rookies kind nicecons : it hasn't changed much last yearyeah , that my only big complaint . i can't help but love this game though . if you're looking save money then there no huge reason buy this unless you play leinart , young , bush , williams , then all means check this out . however , if not those guys doesn't bother you then you really don't need this year game	1

valkyrie profile cult classic . no matter how you look it . it one those games you either loved or hated . obviously enough people loved it enough square-enix re-release original psp make second one playstation 2 . end result great game should satisfy fans original . despite what it looks like , valkyrie profile 2 : silmeria not sequel valkyrie profile but prequel . this means if you've never played first one , fear not , you aren't missing anything . story centers silmeria . she valkyrie trapped body princess alicia . because this it seems like alicia split personality , she got crazy or something . result , alice doesn't very many friends ... if any all . silmeria , exiled odin , leader gods . she now wants revenge what he her , since alice no friends , she agrees help . it interesting story , but much like first one , gets off really slow start takes while pick up . game story told through beautiful cinematics not quite best looking game ps2 , but beautiful enough . backgrounds , characters monsters all detailed . especially some games cutscenes . voice acting also suitable enough game . game also sounds really good . good news valkyrie profile 2 there no time limit . fans first remember there time limit before battle end game . valkyrie profile 2 away thank goodness it . this gives you far more time explore everything game offer , dungeons quite interesting . most dungeons pretty simple . it sort plays out action/adventure style . you photons you fire your enemies certain objects . your photon also reflects off some objects , it actually vital use this some dungeons . so photon isn't just there , it essential . even more interesting valkyrie profile battle system . battles contact based . battle you've got your characters one side your enemies other . first it seems like battles take place real time , but reality , enemy only moves when you move . this gives you more than enough time plan out strategy . each enemy attack zone . if you're it , you'll attacked . most rpgs getting attacked no big deal . valkyrie profile 2 it much more than just big deal . difficulty this game escalates really fast . you'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed some your enemies . luckily there solution . most battles leader . if you defeat leader you win automatically without worry defeating others . it helps if you want end battle quickly , especially helps when your party decimated . still , battle system calls complete strategy your part . they say it takes 40 hours complete valkyrie profile 2 . however , you'll find yourself spending most these hours leveling up take new challenges . i mentioned , difficulty level rises fast . meaning you'll probably lot battling dungeon before moving next . even worse , you'll backtrack out dungeon once you complete it . even worse than , enemies respawn when you reenter room . good thing this least , dungeons aren't overly long . again , however , you'll spend quite some time leveling up . addition inside battle , outside battle just interesting dungeons . you'll often come across sealstones . when you pick them up they grant enhancements your party . they either positive or negative . example your strength could go up grabbing one ... go down grabbing . carrying it puts effect your party . however , you also put effect your enemies setting stone dais . needless say , you'll want put negative effects your enemies ... unless you're looking harder challenge than game already . outside dungeons battles you learn plenty skills throughout game . when you buy equipment , you link it together give your characters special skills . this lot fun play around . although , it should said , it gets tedious set it up after while . game shows you which skills you've created through your equipment , but there no way it auto-equip stuff gives you skill . first this no problem , but then your characters start build up your list gets longer , it becomes pain set up all these skills again . it comes down way too much time menu when there shouldn't . valkyrie profile 2 overall pretty satisfying game . if you get past sluggish story ( which really turn out really good end ) then you'll find yourself love this game . it different first one , but not so much old fans find themselves disappointed . actually it quite opposite . if you liked first game , then all means , pick up this one . good+an interesting story+beautiful graphics+excellent music score+good voice acting+large cast playable characters+interesting skill system+just all out fun playthe bad-the story slow-really steep difficulty level , lot game no doubt come you spending time leveling up dungeons before moving on-the skill system interesting , but not able your equipment auto-equip really annoying when you've got lot characters lot items your inventory -- equipping your characters shouldn't tedious chor	1

it feels so strange describing this game people who never heard it before . " yeah , you play this tiny little prince , your father , king all cosmos , got drunk one night destroyed all stars sky . your job go around earth this psychedelic sticky thing called katamari roll stuff up into big ball . really , that all you - just roll much stuff possible into massive ball , if it big enough , your gigantic , well-endowed father shoot it up into sky become new star . , uh , that plot . " wtf ? yeah , you just gotta play it . that best advice i give . what exactly it attracts me such bizarre game ? perhaps it satisfies some strange compulsion mine just ... roll things up ... into ball . i dunno , it just plain fun . controls very simple - you only use left right analog sticks navigate through your brightly colored , exceedingly cluttered environment . what really adds enjoyment this game sound . every object you pick up lets out unique sound it unapologetically absorbed into your ball junk , it quite amusing . furthermore , soundtrack catchy upbeat , you're sure get songs stuck your head hours ( days , weeks , months ... lol ) . i also love fact this title enjoyable playable both gamers non-gamers alike . controls quick pick up , simple objective easy jump into . truly , this game just off-the-wall fun , if you're willing try something unique healthy dose craziness , give this game roll	1
this doesnt come communicator part goes controller , this just headset ... it sucks ... you'd better off buying one cheap ones , headset wraps around your head , this one always falls out my ear ... my opinion , waste 25 bucks ... -chris	1

i only assume handful people rating this game one star out five gta fanboys or total curmudgeons . forget comparisons gta . yes , some open-world gameplay elements familiar . but this basically tony montana simulator , that ( very considerable ) usp game . it all " what would tony ?

i picked this up zelda when buying wii . this game not those who like realistic driving games , physics nothing short just silly/insane . ... but it so fun ! i love how you get stars " nice crashes " running other trucks off road . action fast driving very intuitive .

after incredible " monkey island " series halted , i feared i would never find series games such imaginative storylines , entertaining dialogue , lush scenery . then " bully " came , i hooked . this really great game , you shouldn't set against it because it really nothing all like grand theft auto . there no blood , no sexuality ( except kissing ) , there so many involving engrossing storylines . characters also some best i've ever seen , each their own stories personality . whole clique thing also reminds you your days high school . get bully -- it awesome game . people who like this game should also look " monkey island " series games pc ps2 , " nancy drew " series pc	1
i little late booming cult following phoenix wright acquired , just bought game this month . however , it not dissapoint . i always fan point click adventures pc but dissapointed trace memory , not so much it bad game but it soo short . i hesitant spend money again game i could beat 10 hours time , but luckily i . phoenix wright one those games enough challenge it you don't feel like you breezing effortlessly through it , yet open enough younger players able play enjoy it well . length game fairly long , five cases solve , each one becoming longer more difficult you play . i must say you really get into characters this game each case connected some way others , i really liked last case added use luminol finger printing tools ( makes you feel all csi , stuff ;) ) . i look forward second one coming out soon , definately recommend this one best ds right now	1
i ordered this game based reviews alone . it great ! not disappoint . only flaw some evidence very specific , even when something else objected . other than great game . hope see sequel	1

this game out while . i playing it long time now . i ever boring moment while playing gta : sa ? no ... i honestly cherished every moment gameplay . why ? because this game so much content capability , it not possible dislike this game if you actually sat down play appreciate it . people giving gta : sa low ratings must joking . control - superb . when i want my character something , he it , no questions asked . if i want fire gun enemy , i get fire gun without put up errors or jams . if i want hop car take off , i get just . content : this game vast improvement over even gta iii . there so much , it impossible ever get bored . every second entertaining ... there always something work and/or improve . challenging missions everywhere ; if you don't want missions you go lift weights , build up your muscles ... or you go put some neat features/colors your personal cars . radio : good stations songs cover just any genre . graphics : course there always room make graphics better , but graphics this game very good , despite there so much disk . this game covers everything , there never really let-down . if you haven't bought/played this game , i suggest you . it worth every penny , keep you entertained accumulated weeks time . good luck	1
no other game looks or plays like this ; missions locations varied colorful ; villians range fat guy dynamite strapped his person corrupt law officials ; , usual , rockstar keeps game play challenging but not overly frustrating ; lots unlockables offer high replay . this one most unique best looking games any system , period . i still throw this one every 6 months go thru . story straightforward engaging ; lots really interesting concepts(machinegun coffin , crazy midgets , whole ' dead-eye ' thing ... ) it controls very well . great game outstanding company . hopefully sequel works .	1

i bought paper mario 2 my neice play when she comes over visit , now she comes over play game . it interesting story line many characters interact . puzzles only moderatly hard so she hasn't gotten stuck lost interest , but story long enough we haven't just breezed through it either . it better if you take so side trips work " missions " fight arena ( where you build up your levels faster ) . you also revisit previous lands re-fight random encounters . only drawback game play long cut screens you read . game flow would better if there option read these you , like super monkey ball 2 . i know , i know , educational aspect reading yourself , but that her parents job , not mine :) game masters find this way too easy but if you just want entertainment without getting stuck long periods time puzzles then parper mario 2 work you . well worth $20 pric	1
i'm 15 i star wars : battlefront 1 2 , star wars : knights old republic 1 2 , this game , i'm getting lego star wars mail any day now . i really like star wars : battlefront 2 star wars : knights old republic 1 , but this game hard place how much i like it . i got this game 2 days ago after work like 2 pm i played it until like 1 am then i woke up next day 9 am i beat it maybe 1 pm . so it took me half day beat . i really mad when i beat it because i fun it just suddenly ended . it really stupid ending too ! good : - you really good control over your squad variety different orders such telling squad mate set up sniping position one spot or telling your slicer slice open door you . this good so you dont everything yourself you dont rely your squad give you covering fire when it takes whole minute slice into computer data base . -the weapons pretty sweet they ones you never really seen before ( except maybe thermal detonators or wookie bowcaster . )-if you become incapacitated , you tell your squad come revive you , or if you don't feel like fighting , tell them just maintain their current orders revive you after fighting . -the way heal yourself bacta station , which i think better than running over health container . -the ai good so your squad actually knows how figh t.t he bad : -the game lot shorter than i expected only 3 different planets/ships-there only 5 different enemies : battle droids , super battle droids , trandoshans , geonosians , magna guards . -the enemies all act same every battle . -super battle droids really annoying fight because they really tough beat if you just blaster rife ( unless you're noob play it easy . )-telling your squad things gets repetative after while . -the ending sucks . -once you beat it , you only play game over harder setting , which not really fun , or play your friends multiplayers , which isn't fun either . so you just put it back shelf while until you're bored feel like playing it again . so , all-in-all , this really fun game until you beat it . so i suggest you " pace " yourself .	1
this game very good it jsut sucks u u cant quit , before u know it , it don	1

we just got ps2 after no game system all since old atari i when i 13 . so learning all quot ; new fangledquot ; controls bit tricky . starsky hutch , well fun game , straight-forward enough learning curve easy enabled me get right into action without die thousand times just learn how maneouvre . i get better controller , game still proving fun challenging without frustrating	1
gun aims western version gta , but falls short . taking non-linear , story-and-side-mission type action genre good idea , but game just feels incomplete me . it fun play but my medium/high end pentium 4 , 3 ghz , 1 mb ram , geforce 6800 gt system , framerate slows down quite bit . not just when entering new environments but random times when i'm wondering why . game probably wasn't fully tested . voice acting good but graphics aren't spectacular even highest level . course i crank down graphics increase performance . gameplay isn't bad but gta much better tasks more difficult require more time accomplish . game took 8-10 hours beat story missions 15-20 hours me acquire 100% completion . i also issue not able assign some keys ( like semicolon key ) game . i hope there patch correct annoying issues like this . funny part game when talking people give you tasks like indian hunter , marshal , others . they talk their hands , sometimes their hands move even when they're not saying anything . it downright hilarious untested sort way . game good received editor choice award pc gamer . i think it overrated , but they mention framerate-hits lower-standard graphics gun weaknesses . i give this game 78% due many performance/graphical issues i've experienced . activision online technical support hasn't proven its worth me , least not yet . hopefully patch come out	1
game lot plot development cutscenes . if you into it then that great . i find i scan gist then move next dialogue . said , all backgrounds simply best ever put screen . i find myself actually commenting aloud myself how beautiful game . action good plot suck you . nothing novel battle system , while plot managed surprise me after playing both it predecessors . completely worth your while	1
i am kid , i not reveal my age , but i playing gta few years . it entertained me so much . i just got ps2 version , i am ordering pc version . here my rating , detail . 1 - horrible2 - bad3 - so-so4 - good5 - impressivegameplay - 4i'm sorry . i can't say gta vice city no glitches , because it many glitches . other than , gameplay perfect . kept me busy hours . audio - 5holy . sound gta vice city so cool , 80 radio , realistic firearm sounds , car engine , pitterpatter your shoes .. wow . that all i say . graphics - 3gta never , i repeat never took full advantage graphics . they always low quality their time , but good enough so it playable . it pretty modern . missions - 5the missions go deep , affect storyline ways you can't imagine . one even involves going around ice cream truck selling ice cream drugs it . it vulgar , but fun . overall - 4.1 out possible 5 . highly ranked game my book . i hope you enjoy it too	1
bottom controller sticks out quite bit , but this not affect gameplay other than it same size regular gamecube controller . simply fantastic ( unless you're one those people just need rumble some reason ) . but one slight problem : it just me , or trigger buttons occasionally fail ? example , resident evil 4 , i'll holding button aim , but it quickly go back forth normal view , if button cancels out . however , this rare , maybe it just me . once again , excellent high-quality controller	1
it fun game . if you like super mario don't miss . it wasn't good previous classic games like smb , smb 3 , or smbw but it sure fun . i played every level except last one too hard . i looked up video youtube decided good enough . i hate , hate , hate , when levels too hard you computer pass them . last level only hard one . i tried 25 times gave up watched video online . if game too hard i'm not going sit there all day doing same thing over over again . this great game ... except last frustratingly repetitious level	1
if you're looking game teaches you some life skills or some morals/ethics , this not game you . if you're looking game where you get blow all sorts stuff up wreck havoc mayhem , you've come right place . some challenges game nearly impossible . which fine because then you just drive around city cause chaos . cheats make game much more fun since it gives you weaponry you would otherwise not able get ( instance , tank ) . this game great when person needs relieve some stress wants forum take out their frustrations , without fear legal consequences . but this game definitely not kids . killing innocent people , carjacking vehicles , beating up prostitues money murdering cops material totally inappropriate children . but adults looking non-wholesome fun , this it ! my only complaint game some glitches ( walking through walls , getting stuck walls , etc . )	1
castlevania curse darkness true gem , among xbox games . i think , it more designed bridge game that coming out future , two player ( probably xbox360 or play station 3 ) . so they get you ( gamers ) used someone other trevor belmont . one dracula not dead . he get reborn , he needs one devil forger masters get reborn . so its either hector or isaac who die bring forth dracula . so since your hector leaves only isaac who becomes dracula . ( dracula mad hector running off during big battle , thus blaming him his down fall trevor belmont . ) but here only point whole game gets me hector way up army evil he change heart just because dracula wants kill every human who wants them destroyed . part brothers me but who cares its fun game anyway hacking slashing all creatures dark . so its like complexed stories line . but way you don't know what what . it come you movies not all what you see what . like beginning you meet zead saint germain . now zead wants help you your quest saint germain wants try stop you . they both hate each other , zead seems so nice germain like total pain . why not any help helps you average death your wife town people who bur her witch sounds good . you fight saint germain latter , tell you truth he hard , he pulls out gun try shoot you , when he near death . latter you find out zead death " grimm reaper " ., after you fight isaac zead takes isaac turns him into lord dracula , final fight . when you beat dracula you seen ending . now everyone says this game short . when actual its two games you play trevor belmont its totally different then playing hector , game play concern more classical castlevania nes snes days . so if you don't like devils want more classical game try beating it once play trevor . but you also find out ending saint germain there finial battle ( hint game castlevania works ) . so honestly game play cool , battles fun if you play long enough you truly enjoy this game its plot twists . it took me 30 hours beat it , hector i'm finish play it trevor belmont , but say its good . i cant campare this play station games my last castlevania castlevania snes . it reminds me lot game stages , but these more detail more fun 3d . one more then there love stories end , yes i know not what you where expecting , hector julia laforeze . doesn't it melt your heart . yes isaac sister hero . how ironic . there hidden stages more bosses after you beat it its truly gem among xbox games . some mad cause i wrote this but cheesy plot line dracula death fighting so long beat this game figure ill just go ahead tell it . its great game	1
saw movie , get game ! ( i also project zoo , good too . ) overall not bad , but then again we love wallace gromit . loved fact friend could join any time help , but you stay close though . we found camera engine tad pain - like two players , camera might get stuck wall , blocking your view - ( tunnels could problem ) but quick fix we one player would exit play moment , would reset camera , then other could rejoin . it challenge beat game 100% but my sister i just ! got brain wedgie finding all rabbits , but loved it just same . loved free roam explore - try reading little signs scattered walls ! they cool ! play it again . addictive game , fun boot . thirty something - yes i still play video games ! some say all weird ones . thank you nick park allowing games ! making movie	1

i just finished hl2 xbox thought some my observations might helpful other prospective buyers . my review primarily concerned my struggle getting hl2 pc or xbox . i bought hl , hl opposing force hl blue shift pc when they came out thoroughly enjoyed them . due hl2 xbox price horror stories i'd read online use pc version hl2 , i decided go xbox version . i make right choice ? hl2 very good game $20 xbox version , represents excellent value money . great graphics , great sound engaging game play . however , i think hl1 pc better game than hl2 xbox . why ? first , original hl much more open ended there often more than one way something or get somewhere . hl2 , i found there only one way . second , controls hl1 better configurable . hl2 xbox , i found some controls really awkward difficult use . example , there air boat drive direction throttle same thumb stick . i assume throttle direction separate keys pc version ? third , when there lot going , example , several combine soldiers firing you , explosions fair bit scenery display , xbox slowed down almost halt ! it just couldn't cope amount processing . i never problem hl1 pc assume suitably equipped pc could cope hl2 just well . lastly , others mentioned you didn't go very far hl2 before you saw `loading ' screen . frequency which you saw this become distracting annoying after while . one plus hl2 there no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there hl1 . remember all hopping floating platform floating platform plants light up when you went near them ? all nonsense gone away which relief ! reflection , most my gripes hl2 more xbox version rather than game itself . if i choose again , i'd buy hl2 pc certainly get any hl2 spin off games pc if they appear like they hl1 . if not , i'll wait hl3 which ending hl2 leaves open .	1
okami fantastic game , perhaps last great game released ps2 . stylish , fun , packed good bit humor , this game kept me occupied over week . although it certainly played good bit faster , most people probably rack up 30+ hours playing this game through first time . action-adventure style gameplay owes quite bit zelda series , but celestial brush adds nice ( original ) gameplay element . okami not overly difficult , i found it bit easy side . camera also bit troublesome few places well , but i would hard pressed find many other faults this game . unless you real dislike cel-shaded graphics , i would heartily recommend this game any ps2 owner	1
this master piece , its art its beatiful ... where i start , words don't describe this game .. i love it , music wonderful . this game combines all good elements gaming into single one ( mystical ninja ( music weirdness ) + zelda perfection ( i mean there no missable events or items game ( although there only one missable ???? game )) + some dragonball ideas ( not power ups ) , i played this game 133 hours ( course everything completed ) i'm sorry it ended ( you finish game much faster but i tend enjoy such masterpieces ) ... result : if you love traditional japanese music culture + perfectly programmed games ... then this game you	1
besides baldur gate ii , icewide dale second most fun crpg game out there . more action than role playing , which fine me . this single-player multi-character game , you get create entire party 6 adventures . plot fairly weak , but action plentiful i love fact you get develop 6 different characters . if you get just one icewind dale games , get icewind dale ii . character generation development much better ( not mention gameplay graphics )	1
this my second ps2 . i traded my first xbox 360 , which only lasted 91 days before it died ( read all it my 360 review ) . leary version 1.0 ps3 , i opted go back ps2 its proven reliability copious games less money . i got set hdtv cables , wireless controller , not looked back . what fool i fall microscams empty promises ! this best game system ! you even play online free ! games more challenging last lot longer than 360 games , which i could beat week , playing hour day . warranty awesome 1 year parts labor ! i am not worried , however , because i my original ps2 10 years without issue before trade-in ! fantastic system unbeatable price ! i keep this one least year before trading it ps3 , once all bugs fixed price goes down $400 .......... until then , long live ps2 !!!	1
so you're looking nba game but don't know which one get ? i shall sort through good bad offered both nba live 2006 nba 2k6 . two i played ( live ' 06 2k6 ) , i honestly say nba 2k6 better buy me . $20 i've countless hours some most joyous moments some most frustrating . however , nba 2k6 more all-around basketball game . if you're good offense poor defense chances good you won't win many games you might think . but if you're only good defense horrible offense , you won't win much then either . you basically play even game altogether ( this based all-star level ) . fans offensive-minded games , look no further than nba live 2006 . basic controls straight-forward easy get hang so there won't any real problems newcomers series ( such myself ) . best aspect featured live ' 06 undoubtedly freestyle superstars . my favorite team 76ers see allen iverson pulling off moves he real life game nothing short rush . highlight when you're left wide open shot , chances extremely good you'll drain it . whereas 2k6 , you still basically perfect release . overall look each game , i'd say nba 2k6 steals well . when you're looking allen iverson ( or any other player matter ) there no question who you're looking . he got his tattoos , his cornrows , mustache , everything . nba live 2006 , other hand , almost tends look childish times . don't get me wrong , graphics dunks awesome look , but you're dribbling upcourt i can't help but think player arms too long . course , could just me . 2k6 also seems more realistic courts ( i could without shots fans though ) . nba 2k6 pros : -fantastic gameplay-the more you play more you learn , making it game you invest time in-the graphics great-when you turn up difficulty it actually gets hardernba 2k6 cons : -offseason legacy mode kind lame-too frustrating times-when other team run , it nearly impossible hit anything other than lay-up-loading time almost ridiculousnba live 2006 pros : -easy anyone pick up play-freestyle superstars-commentary lot better than 2k6-dunks fairly easy execute make some excellent highlightsnba live 2006 cons : -camera angle horrible-far too offensive-minded-almost too easy times-fouls called too liberally youso there you it , fairly unbiased view each game . if live ' 06 drop down $20 i'd highly recommend it , because reality , it really fun play . but $30 i'm not sure if it worth every penny . plus , 2k6 great street ball mode addition legacy mode , so live 06 ever really chance	1
(...) this 2nd game i purchased my macs , it only one i still play . it really good . story original well executed , voice actors excellent , gameplay fun . graphics may not state art these days , but they subtle more believable when compared many today games which rely overmuch special lighting effects . some puzzles frustrating but once learned you find they really quite easy . jumping puzzles chasms result deadly falls , but hey , who said galaxy safe place ? hone your force jumping skills . your other force powers . you'll need them . cinematics well really carry story forward they segue you into next level . john williams score used effectively . if you like immersed star wars universe , this game you . game based quake 3 arena engine , so it plays really smoothly any new hardware . even older ibooks like g3 i perform well enough play jedi outcast . my powerbook , game flies . multiplayer game good , standards capture flag other team play , but it really shines jedi duel , where fights one one , winner remaining fight next player server . this pure star wars light saber dueling it takes skill finesse good duelist ( if one doesn't use cheats , ) . i wish lucasarts would release more games like jedi knight ii : jedi outcast . jedi academy good , but more like expansion jedi outcast . jedi academy pick up end though , dark side ending leaves plenty room new jedi knight game kyle katarn hunting down his wayward apprentice	1
this one best racing games i ever played . you so many modifications your car	1
this isn't your typical run through game , you actually think take risk times . it get little difficult stated alot reviews but that thing i like most it . i rate this just good jedi academy . my only flaws default controls , those pain . i highly recommend changing force powers pain use first but once you got used it it wasn't bad . this decent story line all star wars games fun play . i use few cheat codes some levels ( like level skip)because it gets pretty tough , but i didn't much , maybe twice . anyways , this definately must all star wars fans out there .	1
i think its safe say this game sucks ! before i got this game i thought it would great . i heard so many good things it . once i got it though i realized this game wasnt great everyone said it would . graphics ok but gameplay sound dont impress me all . plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes . all talk you able use force force pretty weak this game . you also dont get force until level 7 some missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning , push , pull , ect . really only good force power grip . ( grip allows you choke people)another thing sucks there different powers force so when you finally get force you build up your power force few levels ( wich could take hours ) finally get your force power strong enough kill enemy , not just wound him . this game also extreamly hard . its like metroid prime you get lost it'll take long time find your way around . if you still want get this game after reading this review suggest renting it first . ( dont dumb like me buy it without renting it . i wasted $50	1
truth , there really hasn't great mana game since secret mana back 1993 . every mana game since met astonishing mixed feelings , children mana no different . why i buy it knowing this ? same reason many mana fans continue invest mana games . there always hope next installment give us same joy secret mana . unfortunately , children mana not this . it doesn't rekindle magic secret mana gave us , but shouldn't suggest it falls short it either . world peril when mana imbalance threatens send world back into dark ages . it up hero or heroine stop this happening thus you'll set out save mana tree world itself . children mana no means great storyline going it . least where it falls short story it more than makes up gameplay . no matter how you look it , children mana dungeon crawler . it rpg , but it falls into dungeon crawling category . when you enter dungeons they're just swarming monsters , you'll surrounded before you know it . so you'll make your way through dungeon battling everything sight until you reach boss , take him , then you're . rinse repeat . process , times become annoying , but children mana offers some variety interesting aspects gameplay make up it . first tidbit interest how combat works . it actually pretty fun go through dungeons killing things . it surprisingly addictive first couple hours . you've got three hit combos you perform enemies . you knock enemies into other enemies . there quite bit intersting things you . however , what also sets it apart lot dungeon crawlers you can't ahead yourself too fast . first foremost , you can't equip use everything you find right off bat . game actually restrict you using overly powerful weapons until you access certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations . this keeps game too simple . you'll also access magic , course . each time you go into dungeon you take spirit you use magic spirit provides you . it interesting play around well . dungeons you also dual wield weapons , although not way you'd think . when i say duel wield i specifically mean you equip two weapons but only use one each time . so you can't go swinging both them same time , which probably would've added more variety gameplay otherwise . lines giving your character different assortment weapons , you also give them gems improve their stats or combat abilities . it interesting , but not really all deep . you'll mostly find or purchase these gems . interesting aspect game completely linear should you decide dwell into many sidequests game offer . children mana not shy offering you side missions go , they're actually pretty well worth it . problem gameplay , however this rinse repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast . objective just every dungeon find what called " gleam drop " then bring it back " gleam well . " it annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out same way . fight through horde enemies , retrieve gleam drop , fight boss leave . over time it becomes increasingly repetative . however , children mana great remedy too . it multiplayer . up four players play time , game so much more fun way . you your friends make your way through dungeons together , sometimes it just blast . there moments slowdown when playing multiplayer mode , but it nothing get too frustrated , because it doesn't happen too often . multiplayer alone adds lot variety complexity gameplay . far graphics go game doesn't look too bad . sprites look like they're ripped straight ouf sword mana ... game completely 2d . however , mana games not taking graphics limit , they've its unique art style , which children mana absolutely gorgeous . it artwork just beautiful look . each environment given extremely good detail . only problem , i mentioned , sprites not nearly detailed . musically , children mana sounds fantastic . it one best sounding ds games out date . very few current games hold candle up it fantastic soundtrack . bottom line simple : children mana very fun game play very mediocre storyline . there just enough variety interest gameplay keep one going adventure , even if storyline just not all great begin . however , keep mind children mana really just dungeon crawl , it uncrealistic expect rpg that all dungeon crawling fantastic storyline blow you away . whole , if you're looking game that fun , you'll find it children mana . however , if you're looking game deep storyline endearing characters , you won't find it children mana . good+beatiful artwork+fantastic soundtrack+there lot variety gameplay+multiplayer blasts+tons sidequests dothe bad-the storyline isn't good-the gameplay lot vareity , but it hard get past fact it repetativ	1
this pretty cool game kills off lonely , boring hours my life , but i feel some levels too long time limit -- not i finish them quickly , but i think they should designed shorter levels . instance , i think make moon level gives you 25 minutes complete it . well , that just great if i 25 minutes kill , but that quite bit time just sit down space out world while i roll junk up into ball . so like 10 tries level kills off 4 hours my life , which gets me closer my sweet , sweet death , but sometimes i like my playtimes shorter fixes . those times , i play zuma , but i wish i could play shorter version katamari	1
there used cereal called kix jingle , " kids like kix what kix got , mom like kix what kix not . " eye toy play2 kix video games . i am parent six year old girl . like many parents , i worried getting video game system my daughter , given prevalent headlines kids not getting enough exercise . then i saw eye toy advertised , i thought it could serve means keep my daugther active , but still allow her participate video game activities which kids love . i bought eye toy play 2 video game , i couldn't happier results . my daughter loves games . they very inventive , if you've seen advertising , you already realize eye toy camera puts player image right middle action . system doesn't work perfectly , but close enough simiulate activities cooking kung fu . game format also allows fun head-to-head competition which great kids parties , etc . best part , my daughter works up real sweat when she plays games . games her jumping , diving , dancing , punching , kicking . she gets great exercise lot more fun than if she just sitting there . games aren't just young kids either . kids up young teen age years seem enjoy them too . matter , i enjoy them , but i'm not worried appearing cool . we also bought my daughter sega superstars disc eye toy . those games geared older children , but there couple which my daughter loves o.o verall , i couldn't happier how this experiment turned out . i really hope more people become aware eye toy benefits , because i think they great solution vexing problem . maybe eye toy should buy old kix gingl e.p.s. one thing eye toy should come lamp . buy one your own ( we use desk lamp flexible neck ) make sure area player very well lit . if not , camera difficult time seeing player , results aren't good .	1
one more interesting video game ideas i've seen long time . japanimation style very cool gameplay very engrossing . using stylus pen perform medical procedures shockingly addictive frequently very challenging	1
all games ds , no other third party title made this good use stylus touch screen than atlus ' trauma center : under knife . playing young , inexperienced surgeon , you use stylus cut , suture , bandage , more effort save your patients . you certain amount time these tasks , well keeping eye your patient vitals while doing such surgeries like removing glass shards re-starting heart flatliner . there storyline trauma center , but it only here way make game move . highlight game what makes it worth picking up fact this one titles makes ds best portable system out there today . level interactivity inituitive , but game loses steam because it ultimately too short . after completeing each surgery , you'll able re-play them boost your surgeon rating , which nice little bonus itself . all all , trauma center : under knife definite must check out all ds owners , but keep mind game isn't everyone	1
one main reasons i decided become gamecube owner due its ability play gba , gbc , gb games external source , television , projector , 5 " universal screen , etc . i could care less its inability play dvds because i already owned playstation 2 . then afterwards , i started using less game boy titles more game called super smash bros melee , which most my former floormates used play almost all time i would just stand there watch . system itself cube-shaped , hence name gamecube . like original xbox , it comes four controller sockets controller similar appearance , but smaller ( no , it not better than ps2 controller ) . like playstation 2 , it uses memory cards store data . unique gamecube handle back unit , making it easier carry . furthermore , it purchased variety colors : platinum , black , purple . other colors imported , though i would recommend finding store paint jobs . i'm giving this 8.3 /10 , but that only because north american , i can't help but feel somewhat cheated . whatever reason , when it comes video games their machines , us dwellers always deprived really neat things , like panasonic qs ( gamecubes built-in dvd players ) , gamecube/game boy player bundle deals , playstation xs , nes axe colors , tri-star adapters , game boy hunters , availability systems multiple colors , etc . interestingly enough , i've found this problem prevalent mostly nintendo sony systems . ( whoever said life isn't fair sure wasn't joking . ) if panasonic ever released us if this system lest available more colors here ( without import - unnecessarily tedious , complicated excessively costly procedure , way ) , then this probably could gotten something closer 5-star range , but all due respect , one would think nintendo would start showing little more consideration respect us americans than tha t.t he kab score : 8.3 super .	1
i don't really review games , because videogames nothing much talk . but anyway , these obe star reviewers all idiots . okay so sometimes idiots who play this game ten hours day idiots also , but that not point . people who write one star reviewers all stupid fragile hilary clinton supporters ans support stupid dumbf *** jack thompson . freaking imbeciles . okay now , this game rules . this game kciks beacuse i anything i want . if i want race car , blah blah blah . i just wanted top get myu point across one star reviewers . if you don't this , get it , i don't care how , but get it . remember , most people who write crap probally actually never tried it or stupid like jach thompson	1
i'd start off saying morrowind one most unique rpg i've played . it least immersive engaging baldur gate 2 or planescape : torment . developers accomplished what they wanted ; make game where one he/she pleases . there countless ways play through this game ! playing through thief type character far different than playing through more combat oriented character . world huge , it takes hours upon hours explore . there so much if you don't stop turn around sometimes , you're bound miss enterance anscesteral tomb or smugglers cave . now some technical things . i'm running this game p4 , 2.53 ghz , 768mb pc2700 memory , geforce4 4200 ti gpu . game runs great 1024x768 resolution full shadows distance . since graphics little dated , i more than excede recommended system , i've chosen install sevaral mods ( which great way keep this game fresh ! ) . most notably , " better bodies " , " better heads " " morrowind comes alive . " first 2 make humanoid people look less blocky more realistic . morrowind comes alive adds many more npc ( generic travelers , ones something offer ; it goods sell or hostile bandits nice looot ) random places , giving game even more immersion factor . over all , i highly recommend this game . fact , i bought it keep me wanting play world warcraft , it worked	1

games released , product you should beable get it freeware or amaturish remake . even dos box emulator comes it cannot opened without file which you must risk downloading third party site , . rar files not open themselves you know . like vivandi , microsoft too chincy develope internal download programs this job(as easily they could ) . vivaldi compounds this afrustration not even putting install program job . you cannot run these games out emulator you cannot use emulator it unopened zipped up thighter than paris hilton jeans . four stars " fun " confounding waste time trying config it without getting virus " two crapola quality compatiblitiy it requires xp despite not able work it ! also king quest 6 not include enhanced windows version which better grapics portraits animaetoins . who works vivandai again ??	1
king quest games classic , but why they not including king quest 8 : mask eternity ? i know it not well received when it came out ( i personally liked it ) . but just because it not well received , they won't include it . it part series , should included well	1
this game matches real thing quite well , but too few questions endure . if you've never seen show , it simply series fifteen , each increasing dollar amount until last , million-dollar question . it drawn out . there speech clip each dollar amount , answer , other things . infamous quot ; final answerquot ; option only appears when you take while answer , unfortunately . lifelines realistic , minus fact quot ; phone friendquot ; really quot ; phone regis friendquot ; . quot ; fast fingerquot ; scrambles choices , first correct key pressed wins . graphics pretty good there neat animations . i recommend this millionare fanatics or trivia people , but only those who won't run out questions	1
disclaimer : i am not employed or associated any way game publisher or developer . i am just consumer . i put disclaimer because people tendency point out all positive game reviews here " planted developers " . may true some cases , but , not here . civcity : rome not without it flaws . mouse cursor bug known issue high-resolution settings , game developers acknowledged this releasing patch soon . how this slipped their beta testers beyond me , but , i'll agree some others here , it nearly game-breaker . aside , if you love things set ancient rome , like me , if you love city builder ( cb ) pc games , like me , you'll absolutely love civcity : rome . don't fooled title , game absolutely nothing civilization series games . it more like blend caesar iii simcity , heavy influence stronghold ii thrown into mix . i personally spent many hours playing game , medium difficulty , i find interface in-game advisors extremely easy navigate . some stated game interface " clunky " hard navigate ... i would love know what game they comparing civcity : rome , because , interface slick very easy use . graphically , game beautiful look . those who say graphics dated living fantasy world . just take look screenshots ! admittedly , graphics not pretty those upcoming caesar iv game , but , they very well , especially newer systems . tutorial manual both very generous well , in-game voice acting charming appropriate , gameplay challenging addictive , learning curve what you would expect any city-builder . i strongly suggest anyone interested city-building games , especially ancient rome based games , check this game out . it well worth 40 bucks you'll get many hours enjoyment . if you high resolution monitor , you may want wait first patch , though . cheers	1
i bought 2 these controllers my kids , because i didn't want cables middle our family room nor i want them sitting too close tv when they played . this controllers excellent . they work perfectly , they easy store because lack cables , weight fine small children , range signal more than enough they aren't battery eaters . i use them well they wonderful . they much better than ones comes playstations	1
i've never bought wireless controller before ... so i wasn't sure what expect . but it turns out , this probably most comfortable video game controller world . logitech wireless ps2 action controller every bit comfortable dualshock 2 , then some . it very curvy controller fits almost too perfectly into palms your hands , buttons placed great . buttons never noticeably stick , full d-pad hundreds times better than sony segmented d-pad , analog sticks extremely sensitive , responding lightest touch , there start/select/analog buttons there 9though analog called mode this controller ) , new button turns vibration or off . placement these four good enough you won't using them often anyways . lag time wonderful this controller . there no noticeable lag whatsoever . radio frequency causes no interference , reciever small barely noticable , if not bit , dare i say it , " cute " . controller weight excellent too . it runs batteries , yet unbelievably light . battery door not stick out back uncomfortably either . your batteries also last you 50 - 300 hours vibration on/off . you won't even know you're playing it when you're middle violent gunfight somewhere . it just good . size also comfortable barely larger than dualshock 2 . plus , there no cords trip over , pull out controller slot , or add mess cords behind your entertainment center . there one small bad point this . vbration feature not good dualshock . but there just too many good things here this controller make it invaluable buy , even this minor drawback . verdict : guilty charges most invaluable piece ps2 hardware ( aside console itself ! ) world . sentenced bought consumers around world . case dismissed	1
using only two cordless controllers ; this one xbox 360 controller , i like this one lot more . it comfortable , small enough not too big , just right weight not too light . i couldn't ask better controller- unless logitech made wired controller leather handles into wireless one , then i'd find myself much more pleased :) buy this one , there isn't better wireless controller out there	1
two ingredients classic game . much like katamari damacy , this game makes you play new way . opposed games really require additional fingers play properly , this one uses only three buttons ; shoulder buttons " o " . shoulders you tilt world so you roll back forth brightly-colored landscape , " o " you spilt into little blobs join back up again . levels works art , each one unique . it shame there no hint book game - poster size copies each level would delight see . ( japan they actually posted entire first level mural-sized ad subways)the obstacles cute they come ; not since mega man series villains so cute infuriating . music ... oh god music . all gibberish ( so they didn't translated ) all adorable , you'll humming them days . this little diversion dominate your life . replay value infinite - you'll spend days trying get last berry . mui mui	1
i baught this game because , i hopping good multiplayer first person shooter wii . but , this not case ... multipler crap . it jsut your basic oldschool 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 ... i am more prone multi player games like time splitters , where you all time . so i pretty dissapointed . story great though . it really takes advantage wii mote , great storyline !! i jsut wish it better multiplayer :	1
final fantasy sometimes thought kiddy game chocobos moogles . final fantasy xii proves this series present awesome storyline graphics all ages adore . don't worry if you haven't played all other final fantasy games . you don't need . there subtle carry-overs , but this game meant stand alone . you young orphan city recovering after war . cruel empire taken over your home town , you enjoy causing trouble soldiers . soon , course , you're swept up epic rebellion . storyline here just * amazing * . not just plot itself , but voice acting , dialogue , graphics , they top notch . this really like part extremely well drama movie . they delve into issues honor , loyalty , love , betrayal , more . i'm adult gamer , i staying up many long nights because i wanted see where story going . some subtle interactions characters cut scenes just amazing . small nods , looks their eyes , you hard pressed remember they animated computer game . gameplay itself revolves around party characters going quests , fighting battles moving through large world . each character gains experience skills they go . you buy them new weapons armor , train them spells , aim them their career growth however you wish . there dual system play here . first , you need physically own weapon or item you wish use - say iron sword . but then you need know how use it too ! you can't just hand iron sword 10 year old piano player expect her know how use it . skill called " license " . you online license chart lets you manage what each character knows . licenses relate each other . if your character learns basics sword work , now they learn more advanced version . it very intuitive adds fun element game . it not just one straight line you choose stuck . it all-directions layout where you try new skills or expand out you learn system better . i really like combat this final fantasy well . instead random battles where enemies appear out nowhere assault you , all enemies " map " you . if you're running path desert see something really scary distance , you run away it ! you don't worry enemies springing up out nowhere slam you into ground . enemies general challenging but not impossible . there spots where you really think enemy what its weakness defeat it . you can't just brute force bash away everything hope succeed . still , great gameplay , gorgeous visuals music voice acting , i really come back plot characters standing out here . there lot talk gaming world game finally goes " little pixels screen " you move point * caring * these characters , what they going through , feeling emotional their highs lows . i really think final fantasy xii hit level . yes , there one or two twerpy characters annoying . even star wars luke whining takashi station beginning , set his " basis growth " . general , though , every single character here seems real , seems complex , you don't want put game down . highly , highly recommended	1
this game very good . they only add coople people stoy line but cool . game folows movies well . you even blow up buildings . only thing i dislike this game littel repeditave . lastly , you get high speed cases cops	1
this game pretty much like gta , same sort graphics , same way driving , same way shooting ... but better part fighting how u threaten people streets scare them instead just killing them . this pretty much follows " godfather " movie story line . example luca brossi dies micheal leaves sicily . one create there mob face game which really cool . then you get accepted corleone family , even get talk don himself . unlike other games if your doing mission some character help you , character doesn't die kills people instead just standing there . my favorite mission when your sonny taking over one enemy families warehouse . game just great amazing ... go buy it	1

chrono cross , which semi sequel 1995 chrono trigger , cant even come close its former games plateua . chrono trigger arguably greatest rpg ever created . so while chrono cross ' not good ' it still whole heck lot things righ t.t he gameplay , story , battles this game all top notch . its fun get handle over numerous tough boss battles this game because elemental magics strategic system . black beats white red beats blue , etc . its always fun interesting see what next dungeon or boss offer . gameplay never sluggish always keep you your toes . also , when you beat game you option replay entire game again all your beefed up characters before . if things going slow you speed them up fast forward button your second play through game . truly brilliant ! so why this game get 4 out 5 if it so darn good ? because its confusing/tedious magic system over abundance characters . most magics summons this game joy watch behold their might . but this game there no magic points you must ' equip ' every single magic spell you . could mean 50+ spells equip per character ! setting up each character late game take upwards 5-10 minutes easily . each spell only cast once per battle unless you buy multiples spell . probably games worst point its ridiculous amount characters . chrono trigger something like 7 recruitable characters you play , each their own terrific unforgettable personalities . chrono cross 44 recruitable characters . 95% your 40+ characters personality wood stool . some characters literally say ' i join your party ' than join never say anything else ever again ! 44 playable characters instead 7 spreads each one way too thin makes them all lose individuality . end this game still one greatest rpgs ever made first playstation . while its few flaws keep it true classic , it still one greatest rpg experiences past 5 years .	1
after release star wars episode iii : revenge sith theaters we got lego star wars ; game lot fun play simply because it emulated movies rather well all characters made entirely legos . lego star wars ii : original trilogy even better simple fact nostalgia . any star wars fan enjoy this . you'll begin game cantina mos eisley . this hub , there you go into any three episodes play through them . start you'll only able choose new hope , but after completing first chapter , you choose empire strikes back or return jedi . you go through three episodes you'll some most memorable moments movies acted out entirely legos . these moments aren't only memorable , but they're given hilarious charm . these moments also actual original versions movies well . other words , han solo shoot firs t.t he game visually striking . seeing your favorite characters original star wars films legos quite treat . not only you get nostalgia star wars , but legos well . even better hilarious antics most scenes . benefit nostalgia even more how john williams ' classic score accompanies each every level game . star wars fan this game ultimate nostalgia . you play through each classic episodes , you'll control several characters . not all once , but you'll end up switch . times you may only two characters , others there may many seven your party once . your characters , depending who they , also their own unique skills they use . jedi example , double jump use force . those who wield blasters grappling hook allows them ascend accessible platforms . droids open up special doors you . other characters , like jawas ewoks able go into vents access areas other characters can't . all actuality , they're really no different than their counterparts original lego star wars . also like original lego star wars , you'll constantly switch characters order get through each every area . you'll switch r2-d2 open up door , example . more than one person play time , which also really cool . you also beat up your allies if you wish , they respawn instantly . gameplay isn't completely same , though , there some small tweaks made here there . additions gameplay aren't huge , but they welcome . you progress through levels all your characters may able assemble certain materials together form droid help them fight . original lego star wars this ability only given jedi , but here everyone it . there also moments when you'll dress up stormtrooper order gain access through certain doors . you'll also given chance some point dress up bounty hunter you'll able use thermal detonators . characters also their own unique abilities . chewie , example , rip stormtroopers arms right out his sockets . all these welcome additions , that not even all there gameplay . time time you'll command vehicles . landspeeders , millennium falcon , x-wing more you take some more memorable moments film , like destroying death star . it probably only take you five hours very least complete story mode all three episodes . however , lego star wars ii full extras . each time you dispatch enemy , whether it story mode or not , you'll earn money . you also destroy certain objects obtain money . you use money you gain purchase cheats hidden characters . each time you get new character they'll walk around hub , you switch them . " purchasing " characters isn't only way get them . you could easily just use one story mode you've got him or her . you'll also get hidden characters if you've got save data original lego star wars . just unlocking all characters takes lot time . importance unlocking characters so you play through certain aspects free play mode . there places story mode default characters couldn't reach . these hidden characters might able reach it , though , so you find yourself playing through levels again . good news these levels so much fun playing through second , third or even fourth time no hassle all . free mode also offers way you customize what character looks like . you could put yoda head luke skywalker body , example . this mostly just lot fun mess around . some combinations just all out crazy . you could , example , put chewbacca head leia body when she wearing slave outfit return jedi . this really doesn't whole lot gameplay whole , but it quite fun mess around , combinations endless . only real problem this game i really think there little , if any , challenge all . each time you die you respawn right where you left off you infinite lives . there really no such thing game over . if you die only penalty you lose money . however , sheer fun factor game enough away , still makes lego star wars ii treat . lego star wars ii surpasses original just everyway . it star wars game classic trilogy instant perfection . if you love original star wars movies , you'll definitely want this game . positive side+based off original theatrical versions not special editions+beautiful game+addictive gameplay+c o-o mode+several extras hidden characters+customizable characters+tons replay valueon negative side-the story mode quite short-while not really much con this game , it got very little challeng	1
i purchased nintendo ds ( pink color ) couple weeks ago . because i travel several times year , i needed something could entertain me during long plane trips . year ago , i purchased gameboy advance but i didn't like graphics . screen too small it difficult see what going . needless say , i sold it few weeks after . i still interested buying portable game system however didn't know whether purchase ds or psp . psp cost quite bit more but it also allows you play movies it . i ended up going ds because store where i bought it only demos ds , not psp . nintendo ds good graphics ( least far better than gba ) . one thing you must look when deciding which portable game system best you selection games . majority nintendo ds games kids . however , there several games adults play " tickle your brain " . i tend go puzzle games but few kid games fun well . what i also like ds you don't press down too hard screen using stylus . you purchase screen protectors your ds but unless you're pressing down much harder than you should , you won't need these . also , you store stylus bottom your system . box contains extra stylii case you lose one but handy storage compartment should prevent this happening . you don't charge system too often . usually one charge lasts several hours . however , whenever i'm playing home , i always plug adapter . also , there headphone jack case you don't want annoy other people audio game you're playing . headphones don't come system so you buy them seperately ( i bought ds starter pack which comes special ds headphones ) . far portable game systems go , i suggest purchasing ds . they're perfect any age ( preschool age adult ) price isn't * too * up there .	1
this fun game . i rarely play games ( last two i really played dungeon keeper final fantasy 7 ) very enjoyable , really not all difficult if you pulse story really cool . my gripes it too easy , evil mode rather boring , you age everyone else not , too short . too short major gripe . only difficult part prison sequence which also best drama story my opinion , i actually got angry then saddend events . they need make sequal which much longer , actually point evil mode gives some simbalance game time character age . buy it anywa	1

this good collection . it even better if you ps1 emulator fast pc . this would cut down lag . ( course , if you such , other options arise . ) some mentioned lag issue . one who played through these snes , i assure you there horrid lag . ps2 faster cd drive some form caching ps1 titles which helps dramatically , but no means removes delay . chrono trigger console , fights started no discernable lag . creatures background jump out you you're fighting no visible delay beyond jumping animation . ( or whatever they ) ff2/4 screen fade black , then faded , but this took eighth quarter second . ( estimated)chrono trigger great game . story fun , characters great . story non-linear you get great feeling control . how many games give you choice killing off one bosses or accepting their help ? ( your choice affects ending reasonable fashion)ff2 ( 4 ) also great story . when i played through it first , i commented how it felt like playing through book . much less choice progression than even earlier ff , though . fun , regardless . finally , he sound quality lower ps version than original console . fade effects music such gone . i haven't played through sufficiently notice any other changes , but one rather glaring . i really liked use fadeing make it sound like you getting away source . ( such millineal fair music fading one wanders away town . ) ps version rather ungraciously terminates some distance , then some further distance fires up new music . jarring . original chrono trigger would get 5/5 , but these issues particularly hinder it .	1
there aren't many games now-a-days get me interested enough play regularly , but dominions 2 one definitely . it multiplayer , multi-platform ( mac , windows , linux ) , turn-based strategy game . there tun different strategies go , many nations , magic items , spells , different units . excellent game hardcore strategy person . only drawback interface . it certainly not perfect takes bit get used . but there lots documentation online help kind stuff . i'd highly recommend this game anyone who likes good multiplayer turn-based strategy . it best i've ever played ( i've played quite few	1
you already knew it good game becuase it final fantasy , probably biggest most popular series history video games . this one probably little worse than best final fantasy games ( such iii vii ) but , despite , what you here game boy advance rpg graphics actually aren't bad , storyline pretty good too . you just can't go wrong final fantasy games .	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1
i like football games . especially good ones . this one no exception . fact , it may best i've played . i madden 2003 i pretty addicted it , but 2006 changed . so many improvements made , like new qb vision . that pretty neat thing use , but it takes while get hang it . you turn it off play old style if you want , though . franchise mode well improved , i think i've gotten where i spend more time dealing owner things than actually playing football . it pretty cool . only thing though you no longer turn salary cap off , so you contract players within means budget , which teach you lot how owners operate . new superstar mode cool , too , you become nfl legend . i haven't yet played online mode yet , but i hear it good , too .	1

third installment since rebirth classic series presumably final chapter " sands time " saga , " two thrones " takes best elements " sands time " ( game one ) " warrior within " ( its sequel ) caps franchise style , finesse , gameplay sharp scimitar blade . you once again assume mantle nameless prince persia . returning home babylon long last find it ruins its people war army sand monsters , prince also finds himself company old friends ... old enemies . cursed , he comes find his body soul split two , periodically his wicked self , known dark prince , rises forth wreak havoc take control prince body . storyline entertaining , its characters more developed than most video games , it strikes nice balance darkness light-heartedness ... something " warrior within " failed achieve . essence , it what you would get if you took tone presentation games one two rolled them together . mentioned before , gameplay not far either . while " sands time " set tone its acrobatic platforming , which remains pretty much tact , " warrior within " took game weak combat mechanics fleshed them out into something little more interesting . happily , both elements retained improved upon this new installment . what more , " tenchu " -like stealth kills now available . while they're far perfectly executed ( sometimes they seem unresponsive ) , they nonetheless offer fresh twist opportunity avoid hand-to-hand combat many circumstances . dark prince significant addition . regularly , throughout course game , prince transforms into this alter-ego - sand monster version himself able use weapon called daggertail . this weapon functions much like belmont whip " castelvania " game , allowing dark prince attack his enemies also swing poles light fixtures access new areas prince couldn't hope reach . while stronger than prince combat , unfortunately dark prince he must sustain himself constant supply sand power or succumb death when it all used up . makes these portions game more intense , , rare occasions , little more frustrating . also new series chariot trials , sequences during which prince must escape via horse-drawn wagons through hazardous environments full speed ahead . while they provide nice change pace when they actually occur , they relatively few trial error nature them lead irritation . there only few glaring flaws " thrones . " sound effects ambient music retain their inconsistent , buggy feel . too often dialogue sputters repeats like broken record , music kind fades departs little rhyme or reason . well , graphics suffer some pretty blatant clipping problems . engine aged pretty gracefully , but it aged - least character designs architecture go long way keep you distracted occasional failings visuals . " prince persia : two thrones " , many respects , very similar game two come before it . therefore it not novel first game longtime followers , but it doesn't feel long tooth it might this stage thanks new gameplay additions entertaining continuation story . it certainly better game than " warrior within , " more welcoming almost every way . this series lot life it , " two thrones " well worth your time effort .	1
this game when released best 1st person shooter console game available . but today doom half life versions xbox , there actually something compare halo , it doesn't stand up . first off , plot utterly pointless . i never felt invested or sympathetic master chief , just frustrated when he died i would replay section . weapons lame . released after pc version quake iii , halo weapons seem limp comparison . none " futuristic " aspects seem particularly believeable or useful , matter . vehicles suck . driving vehicles halo fun operating forklift , which actually quite entertaining gta san andreas , so maybe it not quite fun . i guess it more like driving " super action wacky bike " southpark " chimpocoman " episode . 2 player story mode rules ! best part game only reason reccomend it it great game play friend . multiplayer deathmatch average . give halo props first decent multiplayer battle xbox , but it wasn't good it pc competition when it came out- much older quake iii still looked played better- now seems ok but no better than mos t.t hat said 2 player campaign multiplayer make this good 10-15$ diversion , just don't expect immersive atmosphere doom iii or intriguing plot twists half life ,	1

game when you first buy it awsome . i mean who wouldent want throw cars helicopters , make people fly 20 yards your finger , bunt-kick police car down 5 blocks ? game lasts bit because " smash smash get some cash " gameplay ( more smash points you get , more moves you get ) . moves best part . one point game , you get move lets you grab onto helicopter or big boss . i always loved riding helicopter 5th street ... its alot better then skateboarding bus if you ask me . anyway , once you get all moves beat story mode get canadian boxers , it gets extremely repetitive.at end game , when you get critical alert status , same guys always come . 5/5 stars first 3 weeks-2 months ... 4 next month , basically declining 3but , whenever you board nothin , no good tv , all your friends offline every other game getting booring , its nice take good ol trip back this game smash mech or .. you know , old times sake	1
previous hulk games haven't quite up-to-par other superhero franchises , featuring tedious bruce banner stealth bits instead placing emphasis where it should : smashing stuff , stuff smash up real good . fortunately , isn't problem latest installment . this game all creating much destruction possible any way you see fit , it ripping car two make hulk-sized novelty hulk hands , using truck shield , or fashioning boulder into world largest bowling ball . not only , but hulk large variety moves give player lot options combat . i can't really comment story , since i skipped it . i've never biggest fan green machine mythos backstory , so i suppose your mileage might vary . but not much , thanks flat-as-cardboard voice acting . all all , this game really makes you feel like you're control gargantuan green goliath . boss fights especially great : when you go against giant hulk-busting robot levels entire city blocks each laser sweep , you know you're fun . unfortunately , game drags repetitious combination escort , destroy , fetch story missions . i appreciate banner wants return himself normal , but destroying entire building just snatch cat scan ? that little lame . plus , you'll right end mission when bevy hulk-seeking missiles hulk-crushing mechs always seem show up gun you down . even poor greenie can't much when he wailed all sides . bottom line : probably best superhero game this console generation . hulk smash	1
star wars battlefront allows you play some best troops ever , such rebel alliance , imperials , republic , cis ( confederacy independent systems ) . 3-d graphics make it easier enjoy ; well sound storyline . battlefront , you not play featured characters saga , but you get fight alongside them epic duels . disadvantage you can't wield lightsaber either . instant action , you get pick any location , any side fight . you also choice choose clone wars galactic civil war . matter fact , you drive vehicles , but no space combat ! if you want play episode iii battlefields , your hopes up . only locations episodes i , ii , iv , , vi . there numbers areas battle . but pros cons , cons going hard time through game such : what type soldier ? where my command post ? where my enemy ? pros there nothing wrong . star wars battlefront one best star wars games there star wars , perfect gameplay , terrific graphics , great sound . i highly recommend game any star wars buff out there	1

" , " watch out road block ahead ! " , " you've lost him ! " , etc . if you're not playing , it still great watch ! p.s. i initially bought this my son , got hooked watching him play .	1
what great time you rome ! basic gameplay intuitive . there isn't lot you haven't before . interface pretty standard minimized off screen screenshots or just zooming around without distraction . all these types games , you spend lot time building developing . you need take some time enjoying this one , closeup views city work play what so new here . graphics look somewhat standard zoom out , top down view . there lot looks familiar . until you start get closer look texture details come life you realize there level realism here you watch shadows lengthen plaza near sparkling fountain midday sun moves across sky trees sway breeze . wow ! no other roman game out currently comes close . this everything you always wanted caesar iii somewhat cotn , ( children nile ) although buildings here more substantial better realized . i would liked see more decorative options more variety housing goods you produce . it part appeal adds longevity continued interest game . but what there very good indeed . all structures beautifully attention detail . landscape breathtaking , variety ways put your city together around terrain . enough hustle bustle city streets bring it life . i mention you zoom all way down into arena or colliseum , watch closeups games or swivel around floor arena watch all spectators coming out moving around or cheering ? lot thought went into this game , people who love what they . there some bugs trade routes . hopefully these addressed soon . meantime , avoid placing ports or depots before you goods stock those routes . maps overall somewhat small , although game this graphic intensive would reasonably limit size facilitate performance . there very limited sandbox modes available , least now , i find no user created scenarios currently available due part complexity unsupported editor . i am currently running mid-line gaming system nvidia 6800 , system run oblivion fairly well . i update some drivers well defragment my hard drive run this game smoothly . i hadn't experienced many lags until i built up larger city or playing several hours my system started protest . while it may few faults , most things matter preference adequate , clean system . core game itself fundamentally solid . it takes work build up economic stability based trade taxes how well you handle your production chains . you create , any scenario , stable cities largely run themselves , aside requests/demands empire . stable gameplay , depth , realistic economic simulation , great music breathtaking graphics , it not only very good game but best current selection roman city-builders . so if you chose , i would recommend this one first . enjoy	1
first point , thankfully this wasn't directed good ' ole george . setting game 4,000 years before star wars : new hope , few years after devastating mandolorian wars . this truly fun role-playing game ( rpg ) including interesting characters- everone them unique histories ( including yours ) , almost flawless turn-based combat system , sinister universe dominating villian , ect . this point , graphics aren't greatest , but still nothing scoff . there some bugs dialogue movies , but nothing serious . music , produced gaming-world famous jeremy soule amazing completely allows player become immersed gameplay . basically , every action ( mostly dialogue ) good ( light side ) , neutral , bad ( dark side ) outcome . some reason , dark side way going things more fullfilling .... many movie seen force powers ( lightning , force choke ) well some powers known knights old republic ( kotor ) included keeping you your toes while playing . * spoiler alert * incredilby ( it small universe ) all characters you meet become apart your party your past self . * over * two parts your journey , once begining once more fourth way , player gets choose class his/her character . first time around , what kind grunt old republic you ? second , what kind super-all-powerful-kick-a**-bite-your-head-off jedi you ? one best xbox games ever . period . one better rpgs out there well	1

there alot reasons so you dumb people rtae it low probably never played it heres why i think its great . why its great : -fun editor just mess around ( no need test map people fight)-many units make diffrent stratadgies-god powers great-many mythical units make game unique-the titans crazzzzy-you beat campaign ? well download new free one online go main website aom =d =d =d -beat every campagin exsists ? you still play online make many skirmish wars even make your own campaigns-many fun maps-can easy or hard depending what difficulty you choose so its great everyone-new armies/gods/powers all good stuff =] so basically this games greta buy it actually better yet buy gold edition which this expansion original which you need use expansion . fun	1
this game very fun lots action sure . many people may find this good enough game satisfy them , but i am not one them . mythology part good creatures gods described portrayed very well , but plot campaign messes it all up . last campaign much larger it more fun . i disappointed new campaign . i'd say first one better . if you make big deal graphics though , than this game you . it excellent graphics features . ocean mountain looks so realistic . they good job showing you underwater . these graphics blow away graphics age empires series . if you expecting good campaign , your not going very happy . plot isnt so good its very short . it half other games campaigns . big difference normal games titans always come out . they're kind annoying . overall this game good but not good prequal . graphics-10/10campaign plot-3/10music-6/10mythology-9/10overall-7/10	1
i've got honest , this game more entertaining than probably last three games i've bought , not they bad though . funny thing these kind games ( so long you're using light gun ) they improve your accuracy firearms . it no substitute real shooting , but then again , how often you spend hours shooting probably thousands rounds like these games ? now , game itself , graphics good enough , but arcade style makes it look ... well , not real . but then again part what gives game it charm . buy game , light gun	1

if you've played one madden game you've played them all , most part least , madden ' 07 almost carbon copy madden ' 06 . this incarnation contains all essentials , franchise mode , all nfl teams including all afc , all nfc nfl europe historical teams . create your own player , fan or team then play single games or entire seasons . all usual mini-games madden cards back , well online play those who network add-on ps2 . nfl superstar returns ' 06 , giving you opportunity create player set random ' genes ' or parents , which give wide array player attributes , determining how good your player what position he starts . you also opt load ncaa ' 07 heisman players continue their illustrious career nfl . within superstar you control only your player when he field , option controlling or not controlling your team when he not field . after several seasons hopefully you've gained enough statistics ' cred ' make it into hall fame . both franchise superstar modes allow use different ' roles ' each player aquire meeting certain criteria , these roles increase attributes your player other players your team , or decrease stats players opposing team . some these stats negetive too however , such distracting players or under-achievers . control scheme hasn't changed years . ' truck stick ' now ' highlight stick ' works pretty much same way . qb vision cone back , but this time optional ( better or worse ) . hit-stick defense less picky this year moving stick any direction attempt big hit , opposed hit-sticking direction ball carrier previous games , course your chance clean hit less than your standard diving tackle , ai seems better juking this year . playmaker controls lead blocking controls hangin ' strong extremely useful , practically essential harder difficulties . before snap audible control far more depth than previous games , allowing audibles formation , plays , or just individual routes . playing defense also little harder , relying ai play your defensive backs let up 3-4 big plays td every game , harder difficulties ai just useless stopping run . i gave this game 3 because apparent lack effort ea part deliver reliable product . this game lags , freezes some loading screens buggy all sorts ways . graphics even seem little choppier . credit this all work 360 ps3 versions game , both wich leaps bounds ahead this generation madden games . one game i played , end third quarter 1 second remaining ( ticking away ) , i snapped ball only ref blow his whistle . game froze second , ball then snapped 0:00 clock i allowed continue playing normally , however 4th quarter never started . game would go eternity 0:00 left 3rd quarter . overall it same package you come expect ea madden , probably one last we'll see current generation consles , which good thing my eyes considering lack attention attributed this game favor new ones . customer should always get what they pay , standard retail price ea delivers game which feels neglected , but still madden its core , contains enough what matters not collect any dust until ' 08 .	1

three years ago disgaea hit scene far one best games grace playstation 2 . now we disgaea 2 . disgaea 2 follows " if it ain't broke , don't fix it , " path . while disgaea 2 really familiar first one , that not bad thing , first one absolutely perfect . disgaea 2 connect first one . so this really sequel . it isn't , however , sequel requires knowledge events first game . you may very well run into familiar characters , but whole , disgaea 2 whole new story . adell only human town full monsters it all overlord zenon fault . he put curse town make them all lose their memories . when adell mom decides perform ritual bring forth overlord , she instead brings forth zenon daughter , rozalin . so you'll now venture off search overlord . best thing disgaea 2 storyline same thing worked well first one . it perfect balance it moments seriousness humor . it well crafted story isn't afraid break rules . game really plays no different first one . you'll go into battle able bunch different things . while it play like your basic tactical rpg , it throws some things make it more worthwhile . like geopanels ground if character stands they get special enhancements . you also things like one character stand another shoulders . if you don't like effects , though , you just destroy power source . it not easy it first one , however . these power sources now get up walk around . game also rather complex . battling no walk park . if you're familiar tactical strategy games , then disgaea 2 easy learn . you'll deploy ten your characters battle time . they perform team attacks or attack indivually . you use this your advantage , but your enemies also must kept mind . they don't slouch . they'll attack same time take your characters down pretty fast if you don't know what you're doing . course , disgaea 2 also sports some rather bizarre moments battle just like it prequel . one thing , you order pizza middle battle . this just one many different things you . items also level up , your characters levels soar . it won't take you long complete main storyline , but purists find disgaea 2 , much like first one almost never ending terms complete mastery . your characters levels rise far into hundreds even thousands . it almost never ending . you also replay story missions over over , go into optional dungeons . items also level up . you go into item world level up your items . you level up just any item . your weapons , armor ... even pizza you ordered ! these moments game also feel never-ending times . disgaea 2 pretty much looks feels like first one . it simply beautiful game . it got spectacular artwork . it 2d artwork , but it some most beautiful gaming world . it also sounds really good , keeping theme first game tact . voice acting probably best part . they're so lively vibrant , dialogue crafty filled brim humor . some humor , mind you , probably not suitable your little kid . there some sexual dirty jokes , but they're really funny . disgaea 2 just all out blast . game , one thing huge . it may only take 40 hours or so complete main quest , but master game ? that'll take much longer than just any tactical rpg out there . there so much , it far one most addicting games out there . so if you like tactical strategy rpgs , then all means play this game . you'll love it . if you loved first disgaea , you love this game ! there no doubt it . good+loveable characters+fantastic storyline+addictive gameplay+this game huge+beautiful artwork+complex battle system+vibrant colorful voice acting ; among best gamingthe bad-the only real bad thing this game , if you even say it bad , it doesn't really go above beyond first disgaea . other words , there not whole lot new content or anything like . however , it still bit more original than most other tactical rpgs out ther	1
granted , disgaea 2 won't much fans fighting , fps , or action genres , but those who love anime strategy bundle fun . battle system outside same disgaea , but there some interesting important improvements . here few : one , there lift+attack move ( lifting character then attacking , like makai kingdoms . ) two : character who assigned attack , but unable because target they going attack eliminated character before they could attack no longer loses their move . instead , they get move again instead . three : guns operate significantly different way than bows ( problem disgaea 1 ) giving them great utility . four : speed down , def down , other effects occur more often result weapon usage , easier see . five : treasure chests now part battle ! six : item bag ( i'm pretty sure ) larger . seven : additional battle items available , one them cellular phones . ( you'll find out what they .. ) eight : team attacks become more ridiculous . ( this good thing ! )nine : battle maps much improved , more interesting . game now really spiffy intro , ( hi-res ! ) maintains same irreverent humor previous games . quality , however , par ( actually , better than ) disgaea : hour darkness . voice acting manages not annoying ( many cases its very good ! ) it refreshing play good guy again . laharl obviously game ( he seen character collage art ) there numerous references la pucelle tactics , disgaea : hour darkness , phantom brave makai kingdoms . manual lacks clarity some places , lot graphics still very pixely . overall , though , its hard beat this game fun . but warned , it takes long time play	1
game quite fun play , though it little really offer way replay value . unless you fan both final fantasy series games their elaborate storylines , well fan fps ( first person shooter ) types games , i would probably warn you this particular offering may not your cup tea . it nice get bit more backstory continuation final fantasy vii game ... one best overall series , but gameplay sometime get bit two-dimensional stale . all all , it short but exciting romp through familiar world ... it could more , but it okay what it	1

two ingredients classic game . much like katamari damacy , this game makes you play new way . opposed games really require additional fingers play properly , this one uses only three buttons ; shoulder buttons " o " . shoulders you tilt world so you roll back forth brightly-colored landscape , " o " you spilt into little blobs join back up again . levels works art , each one unique . it shame there no hint book game - poster size copies each level would delight see . ( japan they actually posted entire first level mural-sized ad subways)the obstacles cute they come ; not since mega man series villains so cute infuriating . music ... oh god music . all gibberish ( so they didn't translated ) all adorable , you'll humming them days . this little diversion dominate your life . replay value infinite - you'll spend days trying get last berry . mui mui	1

xenosaga episode i remains type paragon story character driven rpg . there so much tell game players looking sink their teeth into 40 or so hour cinematic rpg wouldn't need look any further , would also very satisfied . episode ii bit shorter not quite good first installment . however , xenosaga iii good rpg get . i love watch films solid plots memorable , meaningful characters . it pleasure experience video game achieve kind involvement through long period 40+ hours . episode iii , throughout its duration , constantly engrosses player many plot developments , flashbacks , insights into many characters . every primary characater respected deep explorations into their own motives agendas . everything game meticulously crafted . every bit plot dialogue builds upon itself intro all way conculsion , still there room much more pondered . there some very memorable music pieces game which really accecntuate current mood . they really serve bring emotional weight characters life . voice acting great all-around . there never moment when acting sounds forced or laughable . difficulty , most part , quite easy . it only until near end game where some bosses may cause you see game over screen few too many times . i actually spent three days stuck one boss . solution this stay driven continue try different strategies . good thing your characters switched out any time even though battle parties only consist three members , rest your comrades whether they battle or not also receive experience points fighting stay leveled your main battle members . this way , you use them later crucial battles when they needed without take trouble level them . i enjoyed xenosaga iii beginning end . game like this especially treat player who appreciates in-depth , character driven , plot-heavy game . philosophical theological themes explored within it raise many questions human beings world . there characters who fight give their lives ideals . there also individuals who struggle find meaning their own lives what path they should take . role destinty fate strong components game . there always something brewing throughout this adventure . there always something captivates you makes you think twice setting controller down .	1
my opinion , this best game xenosaga series . first game received lot well-deserved praise recognition . however , i believe this third game better just every aspect . battle system new introduces concept break . idea place your opponent state , avoiding it your characters . turn-based battle system also very quick . you don't wait 30 seconds your characters execute their battle moves . playable characters respond attack soon you choose type attack you want perform . previous games , you either fight foot or aboard giant e.s. humanoid machines . item equipment shops back , well ability customize your characters fine level . you won't much options choose first game , but ability very close . best part this game though story . i am forty years old read many novels , watched many great movies , played lots video games . my opinion , story told this game surpasses anything i ever come across . plot good . characters very well-developed seem take life you play game watch plot unfold . there action , drama , revelations just every scene . each main plot previous episodes brought conclusion . this truly masterpiece story-telling . i only hope one day , this very moving , thought-provoking , captivating , uplifting story more accessible people who don't play video games . lot people find it spiritual philosophical . yes , theme very serious dramatic . unlike more common whimsical theme most games . but trust me , you play many hours non-stop just watch plot unfold . concepts destiny , purpose , free , choices , life , afterlife , beliefs , love , despair , consequences constantly present story . central character shion uzuki , designer amazing android kos-mos . allen rest supporting cast back . this time , they out uncover plot vector could put future universe danger . mini-game there case you want take break main story enjoy fun game hackox . ofcourse , you professor , jr. allen lighten things up just bit also .	1
first xenosaga amazing me , i thought it wonderful storyline , good battle system , other mechanics good . episode ii kind felt like really unpolished , not yet ready release xenosaga . xenosaga iii however , not disappoint . while game lower budget , one see this , this gave programmers ability focus what really matters , gameplay , storyline . storyline this awesome , what one comes expect when dealing xenosaga game . gameplay like other xenosagas little weak , but still much better than episode ii . also , since this game kind forced last game series before its time , story absolutely no filler . its one exciting story after . trust me , xenosaga fans/sci-fi rpg fans , you love this game , rpg fans also tend focus storyline rather than gameplay love this also . if you love dungeons , skip cutscenes , than this game probably isnt you . awesome game ! pick it up , you wont disappointed , also its only 40 bucks so what you lose	1
3rd party controllers tend suck , so buy this one instead . it light weight , comfortable , symmetrical ( great fighting games ) , rather durable . plus , blue color rather good thing . if you already own four working controllers , there no need get this thing . but if you don't , i'd recomend pickup	1

i've playing final fantasy games since beginning . buy spells , weapons , everything reminds me many early games , which good , my opinion . course , it odd also pay license points them . it not really bad system , there , though . voice-acting , though not worst , still not great . then , again , i prefer japanese language tracks . way i see it , they subtitle these games , if someone too lazy read , they shouldn't playing rpg begin , since always big part any rpg . now , worst part this game : camera . sometimes , it seems jump anywhere , except where it would useful smaller areas . plus , when you try pan left , camera pans right , when you try pan right , camera pans left . i talked someone who played ffxi , they say it similar , except camera pans way you press . i think it meant like , but someone miscoded , rather than take time fix it , they decided just release game . plot , though i not gone far game , yet , seems rather decent plot , though still rathr generic . course , it diffcult create nongeneric plot these days , since most plots already used . favorite rpg : chrono trigger . favorite final fantasy : final fantasy ix . least favorite final fantasy : final fantasy viii . least favorite rpg : sailor moon rpg	1
i picked up wii this game launch day after much research . let me just say i own nes ( i got used ) , n64 , dreamcast , gc , now wii . i getting tired gaming . i am definitely not hardcore gamer , my precious free hours when i come home work i don't want sit around get fat ( that what tv ) . anyway , this game really gets you moving . mini games often hilarious ( you randomly lol while playing ) fun . shooting levels end each set mini games utilize wii controller most natural way , it immersive intuitive . i played this game 33% completion first day i it . this unusual me . i figure i'll get ten hours gameplay out story mode if things continue present pace . game gives you objective early , this motivates you progress through mini games . i like them so much i gone back beaten optional 4th mini game each level i've passed . i can't speak any other launch titles , but i haven't this much fun single player gaming console ... ever . all mini games shooting games ( you shoot plungers way ) available multiplayer after they beaten , although some them cannot played concurrently multiple players . final note , some mini games physically wear you out . some games involving rapid movement ( running , cow milking , cow tossing , carrot juice pumping ) may require you catch your breath . if you can't handle this , then you'll glad know you skip one mini games each level . but this physical exertion makes beating mini game much more gratifying . i cannot recommend this strongly enough . get this game	1

greatest star wars game ever . period . i got this game day it came out , i still can't stop playing it . this game everything original one didn't . new levels awesome , heroes great . oh , it helps heroes aren't immortal anymore like battlefront 1 . unfortunately , some best levels 1 missing 2 , such bespin tatooine . but if you xbox live , you get them + 2 heroes just 4.99 . must all star wars fans gamers alike !!	1

fable reached point where all rpgs dream going . it absolutely pinnacle adventure criteria . creators put you game , they make it fun , they make it interesting . fable game absolutely defines whole light side/dark side thing . because no other game concentrates subtle , small , important details leisures quite like fable . people learn adore you , people learn fear you , you life , you're not just some dummy string instructed exactly what . you hear ? fable life . it adventure . hint unrealism , just point make you eternally amused never decease until fat lady sings . battle system : 9 . it not guns , it not shoot'em up blowing their brains out . it classic swordsplay acrobatics , blocking , stabbing , leaping , lunging , ducking , dodging , running away , nothing say except ' die ' . not mention , you eat pie . it all realistic , hitting someone back , head , torso , all cause different amounts damage , there decapitations if you're lucky . game even keeps track your decapititations , how cool ? there archery , shoot someone arrow , further you pull back your arrow , more damage it , but less accurate it . you see ? realism . plain , clear simple , just like drive-thru guy ordered . leisure life : 9 . flirt chicks , flirt guys . ( eww .. ) flirt chickens . whatever . flirt anything face . get special haircut , facial hair , tatoos , some chicks find them attractive , some scary . some may think you're michael jackson sword get heck away you . hey , that life , right ? one first games ever allow you get married any woman , ( or man ) actually sexual intercourse them . yep , you heard me , sex . don't get cought up kinkiness boys , it lasts 5 seconds when screen goes blank , it only crickets giggles . buy house , rent out your house , live your house , steal anyone , kill anyone , picklock doors , fish , dig , kick chickens , abuse your wife , whatever you wanna , you probably it fable . main adventure : 10 . yes , this game not all just chicken-kicking . there plot . filled surprises , cliff-hangers , ultimate rewards . gameplay : 4 . quite possibly only downside this game . it too easy . i completed game naked didn't die once . there no way change your difficulty . this , however , make game much more fun you don't reload just get lucky order defeat enemy . but all sincerity , you may very well just whiz your way past this game mere hours if you put your mind it . but then again , why i am thankful all bonus material game , because actual game itself go pretty fast . it may seem confusing hard-to-get first , but all rpgs , so just stick it .	1

i honestly don't see why square enix hasn't thought doing this all their older final fantasy games , really . it would definitely appeal newer final fantasy audiences who grownup all 3-d games(all while , giving them good history lesson ff games ) yet appeal us older final fantasy fans its ' old school style . i liked it better when stories simpler follow . that not say i dislike newer final fantasy games , though . things change through years i i love those games just much . game starts off you(luneth ) assembling team heroes(arc , refia , ingus ) restore balance world . this , you must choose jobs(23 all ) help aid you your quest . every battle you play through add each character job level so you'll want use thought building not only your characters main level , but also their job proficiency well . although final fantasy iii very challenging game , it also entertaining one . i wish nintendo ds more rpgs this style . i simply couldn't get enough game kept finding myself fighting one more battle whatnot before putting it down . you'll explore lands , man boat , pilot airship , ride chocobo , find treasure , more . not only but game simply beautiful . i agree , it simply better overall experience 3-d . all all , you're looking rpg clocks around 50/60 hour mark depending how you play . new side quests moogle mail , you'll bit more play . final fantasy iii ds gem shouldn't missed .	1

okay game -- very fun , different powers easy use i like morrowind-esque game mechanics . this feels like smaller , scaled down version morrowind honest . graphics nice engine not hog , you run them fairly high res even clunker i'm playing . so what problem ? freezes ! i reckon it happens every twenty minutes while playing . without able save when you're quest ... it becomes annoying . i don't any sound card issues , any fancy visual themes running ( like windows blinds ) ... bottomline these freezes should not happening yet they . this should already solved now , but there no patches or updates game . arrogant game designers presume they would not encounter any problems they would patch post-release . there not even option menu game search updates ! freezes cripple playability game , so overall it not worth paying playing my opinion	1
this communicator best i ever used . i own game center play video games extended amounts time . it remains comfortable . tha phoeni	1
square enix best rpg developer planet . valkyrie much fun ffs 1-10 , graphics , sound , control , fun all present valkyrie profile 2 . i highly recommend this title	1
beautiful gameplay cinema graphics bring new life valkyrie epic . storyline every bit compelling original some new twists . valkyrie profile 2 one last best games ever hit ps2 making it must buy . personal note , this game made me want play original again before starting it so i highly recommend playing vp1 through before starting vp2	1
i finished original " halo " game x-box , i found myself completely unimpressed . much hype this game found upon its release , i thought it could more depth it . characters , story , fight sequences , weaponry all seemed stale . once you passed first level , you pretty much saw everything there could see game . it became repetitive over time ending left you feverish more . it not deserve " cult " -like status it received . hesitantly , i began playing sequel hopes i could continue trash this series nothing more than premature over-hype fanboys didn't grow up " goldeneye " generation . outstandingly , this sequel impressed me . let me state again , this sequel far , least 100% better than original , so much fact , i found myself asking why this wasn't first series . it drew me continuous play engaging characters , extremely strong story , voices made you proud fighting either master chief or one downtrodden covenant . " halo 2 " takes huge steps forward nearly every facet original . after playing " halo 2 " , original seems like modified version pong . begin , weaponry outstanding . one major complaints i original arsenal weapons seemed minimal best , leaving whole world new weapons unopened . well , this game , these worlds opened fully explored . there so many new detailed weapons this game ; i trouble finding my favorite . thankfully , team bungie understood i couldn't pick just one , finally encouraged master chief use two weapons once . that right boys ; we double-fist needler like it going out business . this small change created so much more enjoyment me because i could really wreak havoc around corner ... there plenty havoc reek . this sequel not just gave you game where you could sit back create explosions any given time , but also developed structured story amazing cut-sequences transformed world " halo " into more than just one-dimensional game . while " halo 2 " boasts shorter play time , what appealed me depth characters spectrum what happening earth during this apparent " war " . original game , i felt my sole purpose destroy ... destroy ... destroy without any questions or answers . not case here , where missions seem intense , purpose forthright , unknown lurks deeper than imagined . there places we traveled this game i didn't think existed " halo " playing field . my eyes , bungie took small somewhat simple game , grew playing field immensely . detail focused graphics intense , introduction this " supernatural " world exciting , deception evil made me push further more than i original . this sequel game you could turn volume up your surround system fully enjoy explosions , swooping incoming enemy ships , well appropriately placed voice moments . anyone loves hear illustrious voice david cross yelling quips quandaries you you destroy any elite , than this perfect game you ! it just felt like more icing already sweet cake . weapons , voices , compelling story ... this exactly what i expected original game , but alas , not see it . if this original release game than i would see hype surrounding it , " halo 2 " nearly flawless clear images , veracity a.i. , well compelling detailed storyline . why couldn't you steal vehicle enemy original ? i experienced enjoyment this game i made it next level unlike original where i knew it just going similar fight aged weapons . this sequel compelled me move forward into deeper unknown . but , again ... it wasn't perfect . while i attest everyone " halo 2 " million times better than pathetic original , there still some small issues need addressed . ending horrid . person not , nor he plan get this time infamous 360 , i left open-ended ending really questions your loyalty finale . same issue happened first game ... so much dedication integrity meat game , why not dedicate spectacular ending ? choice armor master chief seemed weaker than original . i dare not run into fight this time , but instead make me think my attacks . bit annoying when you wanted just run suicide mission . i also hated fact you could not throw grenades when you dual wielding your weapons . master chief strong man/machine ... i strongly believe he could both , which put me into some tougher situations sometimes . finally , why there timed limit arbiter remain cloaked ? these may seem like small things big gamer , but me , they could strengthened create tighter game . overall , i cannot speak higher this sequel . those yell original always better than any sequels , then i would say " halo 2 " exception . bungie took opportunity grow this empire give us view this " war " dual angle , making universal terror greater more relevant . i enjoyed this game beginning struggled ending , all excitement enjoyment i hoping original . i highly suggest this game those unimpressed first , somewhat look forward what trilogy encounter ( if we get it without 360 ) . grade : **** out *****	1
i liked this game . i mean final fantasy vii still god final fantasy game but this ok	1
i all final fantasy games except viii . i just never got around getting it . i purchased viii two months ago i currently beat it . i though it well worth playing . storyline great . each charcter brought something spectacular game . i never put it down . ending alone worth it . 10 10 best story gfs . trinity	1
this pretty cool game kills off lonely , boring hours my life , but i feel some levels too long time limit -- not i finish them quickly , but i think they should designed shorter levels . instance , i think make moon level gives you 25 minutes complete it . well , that just great if i 25 minutes kill , but that quite bit time just sit down space out world while i roll junk up into ball . so like 10 tries level kills off 4 hours my life , which gets me closer my sweet , sweet death , but sometimes i like my playtimes shorter fixes . those times , i play zuma , but i wish i could play shorter version katamari	1
this game great , it definitely beats out simcity4 almost every department . graphics nice , social subcultures nice , game great overall . i only miss region overview , but i'm pretty sure if they copied many elements then ea would pretty good grounds lawsuit/cease desist order . now onto reason i rated this game one overall : i just paid price full game so i could starforce installed my computer . just other day i deleting starforce because it came game mine . this form copy-protection nothing short malware , i've already one dual-layer lightscribe dvd drive reduced worthless piece scrap metal thanks it . i'm getting tired find cracks starforce games i buy legally just avoid severe hardware damage ... point where i've decided i'm not going buy starforce protected products anymore	1
i got this my 8 year old son . he blast , moving , jumping , waving his hands , playing game . my 4 year old daughter easily picked up games too ( bubble pop her favorite ) . i love " anti-grav " demo game intend getting actual game later . it amazing technology work ... this not passive , ps2 game all you break sweat while playing . that what i call fun !! we even make funny videos ourselves see ourselves perform tv !!! cool !	1
after playing this game 16 days , ( i finally finished it after 91 hours game play ) , i now understand why this game won over 40 game year awards , it jus t-t hat-good ! try not breeze your way right through it though , or you'll miss lot wonderful things this game bring your gaming experience . take your time , enjoy it . not your average type game where you just mash button attack enemy , this game requires you think befor you things . it really fun game play . overall , that what playing games all ... fun !	1
it fun game whether you star wars fan or not . it good story good game play . game play very much like first . there few problems when select object your character gets stuck trying run it . game becomes rather easy once you start getting into higher levels . other than it solid rpg	1
this my first introduction wolrd gta , i loved it!i've played gta 3 but it not fun vice city due voice actors included game which gives game life . i wasn't very big fan american music ( since i only listen japanese ) , but this game made me like them bit bit . even though it some " glitches " game , i still prefer this over all gta series	1
i bought this my 15 year old son christmas . he loves it he got me hooked . game everything they say more ! you not displeased if this genre game you like ! only accessory we need gun which we already ordered	1
first time final fantasy releasd america final fantasy anthology package . now game where it belongs . handheld system . gba pretty much end its life , but it still manages get satisfactory game every now then . final fantasy no means best series , but it , most part , rpg deserves appreciation acclaim . final fantasy begins character named bartz witnessing meteorite come hurdling ground . when he goes investigate he meets up lenna . lenna searching her father who gone off wind shrine check wind crystal . lately , wind weak , it only because something wrong wind crystal . addition meeting lenna , bartz also meets galuf , man who lost his memory light meteorite crashing . all he remember his name , he too must also go wind shrine . eventually bartz decides travel them , so your adventure begins . truth , final fantasy doesn't good storyline ... least when compared final fantasy iv all final fantasy games appeared after fifth installment . it pretty basic generic . this obvious how fast you'll meet your main party , how much more emphasis put gameplay . these characters not well developed nor story full unbelievable plot twists . except final fantasy not meant storyline . it all gameplay , that where final fantasy excels most . final fantasy iv before it , final fantasy uses atb battle system . all your characters stand one side screen while all enemies stand other . when character atb gauge fills up , you'll able issue commands . game then plays out turn based fashion . final fantasy simple , yet it lot fun , it also provides challenge . gameplay enhanced even more games complex job system . job system extremely complex , even todays standards . you progress through game you'll obtain job classes your characters . there plenty jobs . monks , thieves , white mages , black mages , plenty more . each them learn several different abilities all which useful you your journey . when you select job certain character , you'll battle earn ability points so they learn all abilities they . some abilities more useful than others , possibilities endless . also , once character learns ability , you change jobs them equip it . so black mage could , fact , use white magic , provided he learned ability it . you'll spend lot time field battling get ability points . more abilities you learn , more ability points you'll need next . this fine all , but most enemies don't give up loads ability points . so game puts huge emphasis battling . this also seen low amounts experience enemies also give off . leveling up slow process . good news battling fun , especially job system place . unless everyone jobs same , there nearly endless possibility commands you give middle battle . final fantasy advance sports same extras all previous final fantasy re-releases gba . extra dungeons some extra bosses , that it . nothing too big , but worth price nonetheless . it'll probably take you 20-30 hours complete final fantasy . it not filled brim secrets like future final fantasy titles , but mastering all jobs really keep you busy several hours alone . it also cool because extra dungeons bosses , you'll get four new job classes . this only adds more already complex gameplay . graphically , final fantasy little dated , even gba standards . it looks far better than it final fantasy anthology . it much smoother little bit update , but it doesn't go extra mile it could've . enemies still only flash attack your characters , they're hardly animated . least game great soundtrack . final fantasy goes show why super nintendo era final fantasy music one best series . game just sounds really good . final fantasy golden treat final fantasy fans . it may weak storyline , but what it lacks story it more than makes up gameplay . it not best series , but it still really fun game . good+it lot fun play+the job system makes lot variety your party+great music+the minor graphic updates welcome+bonus dungeons bosses+there huge emphasis gameplaythe bad-not enough graphical update-weak story character	1
bully isn't game kids , i mean since it bad example them . i mean cause trouble school throwing stink bombs or eggs people . plus you get missions like still panties girls dorm ... gym teacher lol . it also doesn't teach you go school rules . infect you get many missions break school rules . someone old enough not what i see game though it blast . i mean i thought it game where you school time . but no you even get out town eventually even missions there . school stuff fun but you get tired only there . without doing missions you just class or flirt girls or start random fights , or pick locks lockers . plus you start fights those hallway geeks who chase you around if you even second late class . they then bring you class if they catch you . all grand theft auto games basically all seeming exactly same despite different missions it nice see fresh game rock star games . i wouldn't recommed this any parent pick their kid though . well unless they their 20 lol mature enough what they see game .	1

i like football games . especially good ones . this one no exception . fact , it may best i've played . i madden 2003 i pretty addicted it , but 2006 changed . so many improvements made , like new qb vision . that pretty neat thing use , but it takes while get hang it . you turn it off play old style if you want , though . franchise mode well improved , i think i've gotten where i spend more time dealing owner things than actually playing football . it pretty cool . only thing though you no longer turn salary cap off , so you contract players within means budget , which teach you lot how owners operate . new superstar mode cool , too , you become nfl legend . i haven't yet played online mode yet , but i hear it good , too .	1
this fun game young " older " folks . it also great way exercise without monotony scrunches , etc . it little awkward first navigate set-up procedure , but once you catch , fun begins-even 50-somethings like me	1
how you follow up runaway success like 2001 grand theft auto iii ? rockstar north responded year later gta : vice city , game took gameplay its predecessor expanded it considerably . same time , vice city gave series extensive amazing stylistic makeover , drenching experience sights , sounds , attitude miami , florida mid ' 80s . so where you go there ? you take it statewide . grand theft auto : san andreas expands series ' concept encompass three entire cities , well countryside them . gameplay similarly expands , packing some explosive set pieces amazing action-movie-like thrills while maintaining same remarkably fun , freefom gta feel . short , rockstar it again . san andreas definitely lives up grand theft auto name . fact , it arguably best game series . just when you think you're getting used gang warfare , everything goes sour . we're certainly not interested spoiling game many interesting plot twists , so we'll leave out details , but it should suffice say you'll eventually need get heck out los santos . you wind up country outside city , where you'll encounter many more great characters officially embark your quest put right what gone wrong . once you get out los santos , you won't really worry gang warfare while , game settles down into more gta-like feel . like previous games series , san andreas features fairly linear story takes you through game areas . you'll start off restricted los santos -- something story justifies claiming earthquake taken out bridges roads link los santos surrounding area -- but it doesn't take long unlock other two areas . game also throws some pretty great surprises form characters previous entries series . these characters tie gta games together really nicely , so while san andreas feels pretty different other games series , it still feels like you're playing same universe . game also tracks lot other statistics . respect big one , it what you'll earning most you complete missions . not all missions earn you money , but almost all them good slight respect bonus . higher respect rating lets you recruit more more gang members follow you around shoot rival gangs , which new addition nice perk , but not something comes handy very often . you're also rated lot different vehicle categories , like driving , riding motorcycles , bicycling , piloting aircraft . you use vehicle , your skill it slowly increases , which seems tighten up controls bit . case motorcycles , it also makes it less likely you'll fly off bike wreck . your bicycling skills translate into higher bunny hops . similarly , you're given stats every type firearm game . you'll start poor skills all weapons , but don't let tag " poor " fool you--cj skills feel roughly same tommy vercetti when you first squeeze trigger . after getting some time weapon , you'll upgrade it " gangster " level , which extends your lock-on range weapon , speeds up reloading , some cases lets you walk around while locked . upgrading your skill weapon highest level , " hitman , " takes relatively long time , but it extends lock-on range speeds up reloading even further , it also opens up ability dual-wield some one-handed weapons . unloading two full clips submachine-gun ammo extremely satisfying here . just like all gta games , thing makes gta go up over , freedom walk around huge map doing whatever hell you want . you dont just missions , half fun wandering around killing people ! usually , when game tries million different things , it overambitious hodge-podge can't manage get its different parts down cold . grand theft auto : san andreas you doing many , many more things than any previous gta game , while some them work little better than others , strength all these different gameplay elements -- too many count -- makes powerful package not disappoint , despite extremely high standards grand theft auto established san andreas needed live up . its strong story , well-written dialogue , terrific voice cast , impressive graphics , great in-game sound , extremely entertaining varied gameplay , grand theft auto : san andreas stupendous thrill ride shouldn't missed .	1
great game rent ! fun inventions well mini games ... only problem ? i rented it monday morning after 4 1/2 hours game play i beat it . rent ... don't buy it	1

even though there several good reviews already here , this game already couple years old , i still feel compelled put my two cents my favorite game . i've played number other first person shooters , but no other game comes even close . fact , i trouble playing other fps now because they lack so many things make far cry exceptional . this game definitely not everyone though . if you more interested shoot-em-up alien games like doom , or story-driven puzzle solving shooters like half life , then you may not like far cry . if , however , you like me , prefer strategic , calculated shooters without too much fluff , then far cry definitely game you . so what makes far cry unique ? large scale , graphics , level design , balance come mind . i still not seen game better overall graphics . levels huge open-ended , giving you freedom plan your approach . this gives game plenty replayability - there numerous effective strategies each level - well enabling each individual player use his or her own style . game hard , it uses checkpoint system , so there little margin error . normally i'd like option quicksave , but far cry checkpoint system works very well . quicksave system would ruin open-endedness game . more difficult levels , exposing yourself enemy fire spells rapid death . game close realistic this regard any i've seen . even easiest level , however , far cry no walk park . ai smart , uses strategy . it doesn't just rush you blindly , unless odds its favor . first level anything but tutorial , action starts quickly . game long , but contrary what reviewer said , i never found it repetitive , i've replayed it twice . levels distinct , each its unique challenges . this brings us gameplay - what separates far cry every other shooter market . may opinion , far cry perfect this aspect game . first all , vehicles play important role game . unlike many games , if you see something , you use it . there multiple boats , trucks , hang-glider - even forklift - each its place its benefits . then there weapons system . all guns far cry useful , well balanced . you carry four weapons , which again , me , perfect number . just enough add variety , but not so many make game totally unrealistic or so few it becomes annoying . this brings me controls . this area where far cry beats out every other fps , my opinion . you come equipped binoculars , which track your enemies , essential component gameplay . you stealth meter so you know when enemies becoming aware your movements . instead just always running , you find yourself stealthily crouching avoid enemies . last , but definitely not least , you crawl . i no idea why this isn't implemented more games . crawling provides you most stealth , steadies your aim considerably . since there only few places game where you run guns blazing expect stay alive , crawling vital your survival . you lean fire same time . i also never seen these two combined game - i think all games should this feature . so , conclusion , this far my favorite shooter , if you like any same kinds things i , then you should buy this game immediately . its only weakness it requires fairly good system run smoothly , number large patches . if you like exploring beautiful environments , spending time planning your approach , making full use your range controls regular basis , then i highly recommend this game . it intricate very challenging . just writing this review makes me look forward playing it fourth time	1

this well game , especially if you liked movie . characters voices behavior consistent movie there cute storyline game . there number stages you follow order , completing one move nex t.t here pretty small age window its good -- i'd say 6 10 . under 6 , stages too hard . over 10 they're sort easy not engaging -- you fly thru pretty quickly . it would bit better if you could jump around play " games " you enjoy instead go sequentially , but it still well worth buying	1

since there already several well written reviews already posted , i just wanted add one huge thing they've failed mention . this new version option you select swap out different players your party . this never available any other version . much like final fantasy iii ( ff6 japan ) where you comprised your team pool characters , final fantasy iv advance lets you take palom , poram , cid , yang fight moon if you'd like!there also new dungeon ( cave trials ) mt . ordeals requires you take each those characters face boss order unlock their powerful end-game weapons . each these weapons ( specific each character . i.e. you can't equip rydia palom dagger even though they're both black mages ) ultra powerful instantly makes them worthy addition your party ( especially yang ) , well maybe not edward . lolanyway , i'm sure vast majority you who buy this game played previous versions let me tell you you not dissappointed . new fight scene/magic graphics , better music , reworked dialogue unique this version , new areas make you feel like you're playing classic first time ! ps- playing this ds lit	1

it obvious , " gun " isn't everyone ; i really enjoyed it , friend mine , but i've read many reviews ( both this website well elsewhere ) thoughts quite unlike my own . i've read gamers thought controls too sinewy , or storyline wasn't interesting enough , or even " western " genus alone isn't worth game made it . . . personally , i think that entirely untrue . okay , one : this isn't exactly type " western , " or even close what you're familiar regarding clint eastwood , or john wayne - no , this one entirely different . this among new breed " western " genre we've never seen before , where it more negates predominant hero focuses solely brutality west . much like hbo series , " deadwood , " " gun " not only brings us vivid new creation into eyes unsympathetic frontiersman , delightful mechanics such riding horses , firing bows engaging more-or-less " duel " thoroughfare whichever town you're , if you anger townsfolk enough . i think this sort cruelty not only admired , but enjoyed immensely , if right gamer only give it shot get know controls . setting fresh , its many intricate greed-driven plotlines causing much distress lonely horseman , i think music scored this game only vitalizes objective . two : sound , which ties game score , just powerful it heart-warming . i've never enjoyed firing six-shooter so much game , but granted , there haven't many opportunities me try one out , which reason this game makes such amazing gameplay : it never really before . if given time , i'm sure i could come up few games western-based , but none intriguing tongue-dissolving " gun , " i think even those who didn't like could agree me . short , it just beautiful game , albeit many areas need improvement , but overall plentifully satisfying . there few issues , though : one ; length this game dreadfully short . many opportunities this game given , i would think creators would turn it into twenty-five or thirty-hour game , or least give gamer more sub-missions allocate his time ; but end , this game falls short true masterful selection , those little tidbits just didn't make grain . it great game , long it lasted , but unfortunately just wasn't very long . hope , they'll create sequel , but i pray it'll longer much more enjoyable , horses innate fun ride . all , though , i still say " gun " supreme achievement . i enjoyed playing it , although it incredibly short , i still found it pleasant regardless because end , playing rugged protagonist only seeking revenge often implemented videogames , but i scarcely think many better than colton white . . . well , maybe kratos " god war .	1
i friends love western themed games . i must say this got me glued ps2 . it not fair say it better than red dead revolver . rdr lot features gun not . eg : slow motion gun showdown . ok gun , only two cons short . two it relatively easy . but please note there : 1 . variety missions . 2 . variety cool weapons . 3 . interesting game story . i only more games genre come out , it seems popular . thanks , nawa	1
i've my 360 since day one , it worth every dollar . let me start saying there nothing , nothing compares xbox live 360 . microsoft knows online gaming , they know gamer . end month you able download high def movies rent , tv shows free . online community set up help guide you gamers like yourself , people your skill level . sony can't this , ninendo can't this . they try , but xbox doing this years now starting original xbox . so called problems ? all systems them first couple months release , it happenend gamecube , ps2 , we seeing ps3 . i also want mention poster who said not put 360 verticle , not clue . you put it verticle , or horizontal , it works just fine . it turns out , many systems crashing because people got scared rumours , bought nyko cooler . it turn now reported , back pictures , etc . it causing many 360 burn out , it nothing any 360 problems . i personally 360 , soon nintendo wii , i say overall scheme things ... games , online network , options , accessories , etc . you can't beat xbox 360 . not only , sony hype machine wants tell you it graphics better . reality , programmers , 3rd party developers saying they equal graphical power , but you force fed lies hype sony side . not mention much higher price tag . all bs sony , fanboys throw out there . 360 worthy buy ! you really can't go wrong 360 , buy premium , get best game out there ... gears war !	1
it feels so strange describing this game people who never heard it before . " yeah , you play this tiny little prince , your father , king all cosmos , got drunk one night destroyed all stars sky . your job go around earth this psychedelic sticky thing called katamari roll stuff up into big ball . really , that all you - just roll much stuff possible into massive ball , if it big enough , your gigantic , well-endowed father shoot it up into sky become new star . , uh , that plot . " wtf ? yeah , you just gotta play it . that best advice i give . what exactly it attracts me such bizarre game ? perhaps it satisfies some strange compulsion mine just ... roll things up ... into ball . i dunno , it just plain fun . controls very simple - you only use left right analog sticks navigate through your brightly colored , exceedingly cluttered environment . what really adds enjoyment this game sound . every object you pick up lets out unique sound it unapologetically absorbed into your ball junk , it quite amusing . furthermore , soundtrack catchy upbeat , you're sure get songs stuck your head hours ( days , weeks , months ... lol ) . i also love fact this title enjoyable playable both gamers non-gamers alike . controls quick pick up , simple objective easy jump into . truly , this game just off-the-wall fun , if you're willing try something unique healthy dose craziness , give this game roll	1
this doesnt come communicator part goes controller , this just headset ... it sucks ... you'd better off buying one cheap ones , headset wraps around your head , this one always falls out my ear ... my opinion , waste 25 bucks ... -chris	1
this top-notch game . i really enjoyed playing it . it well-designed , thoroughly enjoyable shooter . good looking girl calling you " cowboy " all time bit silly ( especially since my wife also playing game same time i ) . if you've already played halo you're looking different but enjoyable shooter then try this one	1
i bought it several days ago cannot separate myself this game . graphics amazing	1
blinx very exciting game play . beginning , it very confusing but shortly i learned how play . this game very challenging , colorful , long . but i admit i really enjoy playing this game . graphics awesome . just marveously awesome	1
i ordered this set primarily lotr : return king , but after i got it , it turns out my graphics chip not powerful enough play it . but i able play other three games i really enjoyed freedom fighters medal honor . black white okay but i wasn't able get into it . but it should noted black white you get both original game expansion pack creature isle . so you really getting five games instead four . so i highly recommend this set if you want play some good , but not so modern games spend little money	1
this game great . i mean it might just like last years game all , but still it pretty cool . i like graphics . they don't show great detail , but they suffice . new momentum meter nothing special . it doesn't help you or anything . it just tells you who doing better game . new emotions expressed players really helps you know tempo game . one thing sort con this year campus legend mode . that really only reason i bought this game . i really don't like college football team well enough franchise it . i like csu though , so i might try it . but anyway , campus legend mode lets you normal thing . pick your position instence . you get lots drills your position this year . good some , bad most . also , you pick major . what up ? i mean , college football rough enough but study major ? unbelieveable . then they expect you remember all stuff you studied take two tests it each year . i got so frustrated i failing chemistry i started write all answers down . so i'm doing better now . trust me though , this game fun play random games your college team or guess franchise your favorite college team , but please , if you want make all-star football player , just go out but ncaa football 2006 . way more easier	1
you darkened corner . you watch patrolman descends stairs . you size him up , noticing his ak-47 drawn . you quietly sneak up behind him , when he stops walking , you grab him . you place your silenced pistol up his forehead drag him into darkened corner . guard walks into room . you quickly turn your pistol towards him , shoot , then turn back your hostage . you quickly hit him back neck , knocking him out . this great game . it made ( i believe ) 2001 , yet graphics rival games such halo 2 . physics game amazing , it very well programed . your guns drop shells , which stay ground breifly , bullets leave holes walls . guards notice you if you too loud , if their comrades sniped , they sometimes open fire , even not knowing where you . you knock out , kill , or avoid enemies . graphics , like i said , amazing . fire looks very realistic , lighting perfectly . people look realistic , not quite so much scenery , but even games like halo 2 , people not focus . missions change greatly , environments change them . dialouge isn't great , but it decent , if you dont play too close attention it , it nice backround noise . all all , if you one game buy , buy this one .	1
i bought this after it out year , so not much available line there year ago , also it german game , so limited usa playing . but i loved first sacred i also loved sacred underworld , if you don't plan line playing sacred worth money	1
* first off , all patches driver updates they recommended , not stop this game crashing my pc ( something nothing else ever ) during every game session . i ati card they desired met standards . there no online support other than reading what already written . yet this game enjoyable enough me play it every opportunity , rebooting needed , until i completed it . age empires 2 only other pc game hooked me . you note , you begin this game , it humor , some ways targeted teenage audience . i think people almost all ages get kick out this unusual rpg game . you heard populous ? it playstation game where you goddess , looking down controlling your tribe ; making sure towns built defended , throwing out some magic your own . w2 reminds me it , except here you also " creature " , your own pet you help raise train through reward punishment . i like we given choice 4 choose also . there enough freedom this game concentrate fighting , or city-building , or both , whichever your preference . there also little side-missions optional complete , but give you more money buy things . they puzzles figure out . each land level , game actually go quickly , especially after 3rd land . your first enemies , last , aztecs , which taunt you background while you play . 2nd norse , 3rd , japanese . after you completed all levels , game lets you start over level 3 norse , but now you all fancy buildings impress them all magic too . your creature full grown battle hardened . this makes it almost too easy 2nd time ! i creature expansion this game way . i hope it written more compatable my pc . ( 1.8 amd xp w/2 hd , 1 gig ram)this game worth try if you like city-building or rpg !	1
when i first heard this game , i basically ignored it . then , when i visiting gamestop one day , i decided buy it . i instantly amazed unique battle system , bright cheerful backdrops , ( except twilight town , ) challenging profound gameplay . i not played first one , but i probably get it virtual console wii . one problem game it too short	1
this game really good ! i real up-to-date computer so everything runs fast smooth . multiplayer great ! you play 1,000 ' people huge number maps game styles . you even type message your team or everyone hear ! one down points multilayer , someone may modded map mess up game or give them unlimited ammo you get nothing . thing would lag . this where game moves real " choppy " or you lose network connection . still , its really fun game	1
this game rivals battlefront 2 all time greatest star wars game ver made . this game very similar halo its 1st person concept w/ hud . every level different lots strategic tasks . graphics gameplay awsome . i can't wait this game 360 compatible .	1
when i got my republic commando game instruction booklet missing . i didn't want wait amazon send me game book so i pop cd my xbox hoped i'd able figure it out my own . i able too , there lot screen hints help you get through 1st couple fights . but without book i never figure out how get my men search room me or destroy enemies me described other reviews ; i most killing myself , it took me awhile -- pushing ever button control pad -- figure out how change weapons reload . still despite not instruction booklet help me , i still able finish games 4 nights . things i like game graphic great like watching movie . i didn't fit bad guys over , over over again ; you know like other games -- like episode iii -- you die 7 or 9 times before you finally defeat big villian story line keeps you hooked . things i didn't like game missing book . it over too quickly . i would say it easy game play , anyone finish it even if your not big time game player . i would recommend playing this game 1st get use 1st person battle game play before buying hard rating battle games	1
gun aims western version gta , but falls short . taking non-linear , story-and-side-mission type action genre good idea , but game just feels incomplete me . it fun play but my medium/high end pentium 4 , 3 ghz , 1 mb ram , geforce 6800 gt system , framerate slows down quite bit . not just when entering new environments but random times when i'm wondering why . game probably wasn't fully tested . voice acting good but graphics aren't spectacular even highest level . course i crank down graphics increase performance . gameplay isn't bad but gta much better tasks more difficult require more time accomplish . game took 8-10 hours beat story missions 15-20 hours me acquire 100% completion . i also issue not able assign some keys ( like semicolon key ) game . i hope there patch correct annoying issues like this . funny part game when talking people give you tasks like indian hunter , marshal , others . they talk their hands , sometimes their hands move even when they're not saying anything . it downright hilarious untested sort way . game good received editor choice award pc gamer . i think it overrated , but they mention framerate-hits lower-standard graphics gun weaknesses . i give this game 78% due many performance/graphical issues i've experienced . activision online technical support hasn't proven its worth me , least not yet . hopefully patch come out	1
this kit not just card . previous review indicated bestbuy.com selling this $49.99 . not correct . they selling card $49.99 . this kit comes card plus several other components , thus making it $20 more . you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere , but not significantly . it what it intends .	1

no wires ! us , range not problem they work just like normal controller . only drawback kids leave them turned batteries need replaced . :( long you don't use rumble option , batteries seem last long time	1
gta series best games ever created , freedom what ever you want , take out gangs rocket launcher , toss nade into heavy populated areas , kill police take their cars , put out fires earn money , beat up civilians take their money , help mob bosses , pick up hookers taxi drop them off , hack people death chainsaw , own mansions other properties , fly jetpack , kill army soldiers take their tanks jets , listen radio stations humorous radio talk shows ads like pogo monkey . just best games ever created	1
if you're looking game teaches you some life skills or some morals/ethics , this not game you . if you're looking game where you get blow all sorts stuff up wreck havoc mayhem , you've come right place . some challenges game nearly impossible . which fine because then you just drive around city cause chaos . cheats make game much more fun since it gives you weaponry you would otherwise not able get ( instance , tank ) . this game great when person needs relieve some stress wants forum take out their frustrations , without fear legal consequences . but this game definitely not kids . killing innocent people , carjacking vehicles , beating up prostitues money murdering cops material totally inappropriate children . but adults looking non-wholesome fun , this it ! my only complaint game some glitches ( walking through walls , getting stuck walls , etc . )	1
someone who enjoyed previous castleavania games going back early nintendo systems , i find this new incarnation somewhat different than 2d games old . but i still liked it lot . basically this game my main preoccupation last 2 weeks or so . i'd rank it one top 5 xbox games i've ever played ( out 50 or so ) terms sheer fun level . primarily i liked fact you gain new items skills , you go back previously explored areas new areas open up . this " expanding universe " aspect makes it similar super metroid games little like some zelda titles gamecube . i also found " combine " system ( seeking out materials create new weapons armor ) very engrossing , i liked various ways obtain those materials - steal monsters , seek out hidden rooms , etc . graphics sound fx well below " all-time great " level games like halo 1 or 2 , but they're perfectly servicable , ranging very good excellent . i thought spooky ambiance various castle hallways , dungeons , etc ., actually captured rather well . although i completely get into process exploring various worlds this game ( especially help some online faq references ! ) , i concede few drawbacks . currency uses fairly limited . there only one shop , things you most want or need cannot bought there . later stages game , you accumulate lot excess cash can't used anything . also , process levelling-up your character his " i.d. " ( innocent devil ) companions definitely got rather repetitive little boring after awhile . those minor drawbacks , however . overall , this great game	1
i loved game . characers great . worlds interesting , it still deosnt look outdated . combat fairly strategic . unfortuneatley games ending rather lack luster	1
half-life 2 xbox better than other shooters like halo like , because instead simply going kill , you resourceful quick witted navigate levels overcome obstacles . not mention , i loosely quote one halo developers , halo all same thirty seconds fun repeated over over . he couldn't more correct . half-life 2 , progression usually guarantees new sights , stimulates interest playing further . guns not anything incredibly original , but they well balanced some cool features . least none them need ten seconds charge make one shot effective , like ' covenant ' weapons . story , beginning absolutely riveting you work escape orwellian cruelty combine city . city itself beautifully rendered very believable , npc . alien creatures you encounter heck lot less annoying than halo flood . i think head-crabs could use work though . they look like animate rotisserie chickens ! awesome game , far better than most competition . my only major complaint vehicle levels too long repetitive , vehicle controls suck you can't see freakin ' thing . this won't kill game you , but god ski-boat level , it definitely try . anyway , if you like shooters all , buy this one .	1
my best friend halo lover . when i learned this game i not interested until i read some reviews saw videos what you could game , not mention graphics . quite while my best friend i got into crazy dispute inbetween which game better . i enjoy halo but half-life 2 just overpowers it so much . p.c. i think only thing could beat it half-life 3 once it comes out , what my friend says halo 2 ( only thing beat it halo 3 ) . now , half-life 2 p.c. doesn't take entirely high tech computer , fact you graphic card direct x7 this game p.c. if you own p.c. version i'm sure you told before there no reason buy it xbox , which true . game port p.c. version you probably find nothing new xbox version caompared p.c. version . if you incredibly high p.c. don't waste your money xbox version because p.c. least ati radeon x800 video card , 2.4 ghz processor , 512mb ram , i'm pretty sure run game max , i'm not sure i don't own p.c. versoin . okay , now game itself . this game not multiplayer componant , so if you only game multiplayer side things you won't find any . if you complaining you understand why this game no multiplayer componant end this review . half-life original game released valve , game company , year 1999 went computer game year . six years later , six years valve worked sequel , released it 2004 . game my favorite game all time now . game won nine goty ( game year ) awards 2004 , which included game year ( it beat halo 2 ) , p.c. game year , outstanding innovation computer gaming , outstanding achievemant animation , outstanding achievmant art direction , outstanding character performance - male , outstanding achievmant game play engineering , outstanding achievmant visual engineering , first person action game year . so it won nine goty awards , but it nominated eleven . since half-life 2 such story driven game i begin storyline . if you not played half-life 1 storyline may not make much sense , which makes game even better because you get puzzle your past storyline world you currently . not even i yet understood everything what happened first half-life game i probably never . but give you some sense what happening you play character named gordan freeman who , several years ago transfered over science research facility called black mesa . what i know gordan accidentally unleashed alien races upon earth . i not say anymore ruin storyline because less you know better it , i ruined quite bit storyline myself becuase i found out too much game . now characters . characters game incredibly realistic . i told before valve created into characters faces what they called " muscles " . game characters obviously not real muscles but if you look movement characters jaws , they actually move , escpecially during opening scene . besides complexity characters realistic looking " muscles " characters excellant voices could not anyone else doing their voices better . characters actually more immeresed into game rather than your average f.p.s. areas where there only dialoge , which enjoyable , you might notice if someone talking you they looking directly you . if you go behind them while they talking you , they turn around instead just stand there talking thin air . if there something passing character like friend , their eyes actually follow person walking , which always amazes me . gameplay- probably every review this game you find most likely it largest section gameplay half-life 2 , good reason . there single element truly makes writing gameplay worthwhile : physics . most games you play something known ragdoll physics , this where if you find dead enemy nearby they move around according their enviroment . example , if you walk over dead body game ragdoll physics body most likely start rolling . these physics found games like republic commando , far cry . half-life 2 built unique physics engine made valve called havok physics . havok pysics one best versions physic engines abailable gaming market . every object game different weights , when you strike , shoot , move , or whack those objects they actually feel real look real . explosions made this physics engine so amazing when you shoot explosive barrels you see red shattered pieces fly different directions looking like explosion came inside , which it . you find most physics interactible through one best weapons first person shooters today : gravity gun . this weapon law physics built right into it , pretty much everyting your weapon , i think you could figure it out there . more gameplay would including your fameous hazard suit which provide you shielding if you charge it . suit also allow you breath underwater time , it comes equipped rechargeable flashlight , cool sprint feature which recharges too . gamespy said p.c. review half-life 2 throughout game you introduced new weapons one one , whenever you get new weapon you put situations you need weapon so you learn which enemies you should shoot which weapons , where use weapons , how use them tactically which very good way show you how use weapons this game . there eleven weapons this game which may seem small but gravity gun you not need any more . i not think you could come up any more weapons you would want . . i . - half-life pretty tough a.i. they really know how flank throw grenades . grenades draw you into areas you shot up killed or grenades kill you , so combat pretty intense . you hear combine ( enemies ) talking each other through radios their helmets they plan attack you . overall combine largest example a.i. half-life 2 , other enemies aren't smart because they more animalistic rather than human . sound- every weapon , every voice , every explosion , every splash water , every alarm , every organic noise you hear this game good . water sounds what you find most games just because they all pretty much same . when you hear strange creatures getting shot their legs break or blood splatters them it sounds like it should . gun shots could not wanted any other way , i already mentioned voices . ign video review p.c. version this game says you cannot really say anything bad this game , goes sound too . where next , oh music- game great music , it this strange feeling it , but it fits all i really say . some reviews say this game bad framerate ( gamespot ) , but i say it only occurs when there large amounts physics taking place if you say so so better framerate than half-life 2 i simply ask you , " game havok physics engine ? " if it , okay , half-life 2 still better . i said earlier you find out why there no multiplayer componant half-life 2 available , which true it because it hard enough get such great game half-life 2 xbox alone it complex physics engine . if you want half-life 2 multiplayer apect , i would not blame you , gravity gun , fun . but there game made valve xbox made specifically multiplayer called counter-strike , it modern warfare what i know m-16s alike , but what i heard it incredibly fun , go ahead buy one if you want it same company but just know it not look good becuase counter-strike pretty old game i think . game supposed filled crazy multiplayer combat , but i not played it so i leave it . i saved one largest parts game last : graphics . valve created masterpiece when it comes graphics this game . six years really allowed them go far they could when it comes their graphics , this best looking xbox game out there . compared p.c. graphics ati radeon x800 video card it not look good , xbox there some minor details could not brought up what they should look like , but they details you not paying much attention . if you played game where graphics impressive but still not great , walked up wall you see flaws fakeness graphics . when you walk out good twenty feet wall then look realistic . half-life 2 , flaws still there but you only need ten feet away instead twenty . i wish i could keep going , i probably but i spent least hour typing this review just say this game one best games out there most likely best first person shooter xbox probably always . if you see game words valve front box outlined white lines , expect perfection , unless it counter strike , those games more based multiplayer side things rater than all aspects normal game . my closing statement half-life 2 game sheer perfection , it best xbox single player game available : buy this game ! it worth it .	1
its no secret i'm not fan point clicks . they seem harder , general , my computer than 3-d action games , which something i'll never understand ( unless it copy-protection software ) . i've played through three or four drew games . " secret old clock " most fun me . i liked golf game , sewing project ... i actually proud when i finished sewing side quest . i liked driving around car . retrospect its analogous guiding magnet through maze . i fun none-the-less . i stumbled little cb radio ... got little convoluted bizarre , but i it . other games either too hard or too easy . this one keep you occupied little while ... this one employ element fun . mar	1
there 2 games this ultimate collection , iwd + expansion pack , other iwd2 . there bgm cd it . course , manuals included . this ultimate collection better than i thought , because i purchased baldur gate ultimate collection , too . but only game cds it , no manuals	1
i played all rpgs , baldur gate , nwn , dungeon siege , final fantasy , toee , etc . i say , stumbling upon icewind dale 2 real treat .. sure graphics dated , but wow .. storyline , dialogue , descriptions rooms actions all incredibly well written ( breath fresh air , after playing ds ) . quests don't get way game , like so many others get bogged down annoying side-quests lame attempt flesh out world . i would prefered game turn based like toee , but this game battles numerous really fun ; partially good monster design .. compare bugbears this game nwn .. so much better , partially unforgettable situations dungeons . when pitted against other dd ruleset games , spell choices offered levels they given superior all others . i actually enjoyed druid my party , who could transform his arms into pythons , first time crpg history actually used summon animals spells . even if many spells simular other games , these felt more tailored characters made useful , instead waiting till higher levels get one useful spell . my favorite part i could handpick my team , where baldur gate i forced play characters i didn't like , or nwn where it removed tedious interact henchmen . i enjoyed rping characters backgrounds , interactions my head , really enjoyed finding treasure , unique iwd2 , like wide variety cut gems . ( which became addiction)if you updated this game graphically level toee , made it turn based battle tactics , it would my all time favorite rpg	1
if you enjoy series you love game ... simple . very entertaining . don't miss it	1
i always loved ea games . i purchased every single madden game since 97 every nba live game since 01 . said i see very little improvement over years . last year nfl 2k5 blew away madden so i figured i would give sega chance . after playin nba 2k6 i trully become addicted . it really sad because i skip work play this wonderful game . however many pros nba 2k6 thier also few cons . pros : wonderful graphics , superb gameplay(realistic very start)cons : learn use directional passing or ball hog because you lot tunovers otherwise . soundtrack horrible but you just put tv mute until you start playing game . dunks also not flashy nba live but you won't care much . bottom line . go get this game now . stop what you doing purchase this game pronto . if you it , get one just case one you now breaks . throw nba live trash or trade it this game . end stroy !!!!!	1
kyle katarn once jedi knight . he once helped fledgling new republic its strugle against empire . until drommund kaas , when he confronted darkness himself , gave it . so he gave up his lightsaber luke skywalker , swearing never touch force again . he went back working new republic mercenary alongside jan ors , only other person galaxy who knew location fabled valley jedi , incalculable power it contained . he might lived rest his life way , only his blaster , his wits , jan , woman he loved , count . until they took one mission ended all tha t.t hey met desann , powerful dark jedi , his apprentice tavion . they , admiral galak fyyar , imperial scientist , trying find way artificially infuse force into living subjects , mass-produce their own army dark jedi . needless say , they succeed ... it all kyle fault . so what former jedi ? simple . take back your force abilities , reclaim your lightsaber , go hunting . this game great job improving combat force powers original jedi knight . your force abilities taken directly movies , none showy powers you saw original . you end up eight all ; four neutral , two light , two dark , but they're selected you automatically . you can't upgrade them freely you could before . lightsaber combat vastly improved ; they used motion-capture animate kyle his enemies , it shows . even lightsabers themselves look better , like they taken directly movies . enemies just what you'd want star wars game . they basically fall into three categories ; imperials , bounty hunters , reborn . imperials range stormtroopers ( killing them never gets old ) , officers , droids , engineers . bounty hunters four different races ; rodians , grans , trandoshans , weequay , they're pretty much interchangable . but reborn ... oh boy , they challenge . reborn result admiral fyyar experiements artificially stimulating midichlorian production . they're all dark jedi , they're all insane process . you'll want pay attention what color they're wearing when you fight them ; orange blue aren't so bad , green tougher , but red black ? ready fight . that not even counting shadowtroopers ... ' boss ' enemies nicely varied well . reelo baruk , criminal connection , nothing . admiral fyyar , his shielded power armor , like walking tank . tavion desann very crafty ; those two toughest enemies game . fortunately , you won't completely alone . jan ors fights alongside you briefly , republic soldiers fellow jedi knights . raven software even brilliant idea bringing lando calrissian ( voiced billy dee williams himself ! ) luke skywalker back you up . fact , fighting alongside luke one game high points ; two you squaring off against both stormtroopers reborn one area . my only complaint it over way too soon . locales just eclectic you'd expect star wars game , or movie , matter . you go abandoned imperial listening post , crystal mine under imperial control , nar shaddaa , bespin , asteroid base , imperial star destroyer , even yavin 4 , home jedi academy itself . every location find new ways challenge you , no matter what powers or weapons you time . but once again , it story pulls you more than anything else . continuing story what happens new republic after movies compelling enough -- i think we all wonder what happened after return jedi -- but framing it around events kyle katarn life puts you right there middle it all . kyle fascinating character , make no mistake -- kind like hybrid luke han solo -- but you're one directing action . you're slugging it out stormtroopers . you're slinging lightsaber against dark jedi . you're jedi knight . that best selling point i think	1
... when lucasarts good company . today , lucasarts nothing but greedy company cares nothing its customers , i can't same i'm impressed george lucas these days either . but anyway , when jedi outcast hit stores lucasarts best gaming company existance . they nice ceo , unlike one they now . one who actually cared us gamers . i'm sorry , i'm really ranting here . jedi outcast , 2nd best game history second only kotor , you play ex-jedi named kyle katarn . story takes place 10 years or so after return jedi kyle katarn ( you ) given up your lightsaber force powers fear falling dark side . but republic needs you , so you must train become jedi again face your destiny . there many interesting cool characters game , like fat rodian garbage collector reelo baruk your companion jan ors . not mention master sith desann his apprentice tavion . also , multiplayer mode fantastic !!! only problem , no one ever playing . i play myself ai bots its still really fun !!! you stormtroopers lightsabers !!! single player amazing , too . storyline somewhat confusing but interesting all same . graphics pretty impressive 2002 game combat system nicely . i love slashing arms stormtroopers . what fun . yes , its true you only use blue single-bladed lightsaber game . but never fear . i discovered cheat change your blade color : first , hold shift hit ` located left 1 key . this bring up console . type " devmapall " ( no quotes ) hit enter . next type " sabercolor " where what color your saber . here colors : orange , yellow , red , blue , green , purple . enjoy one ! while cheating , always " devmapall " first . it enables cheats . my all-time favorite cheat " g_saberrealisticcombat 3 " i won't tell you what it . find out yourself killing enemy . but its funny . ( don't worry it doesn't crash game i wouldn't you)i first discovered wonders outcast when i played it my cousins house . we sat there hours fun screwing cheats . that also really cool : cheating not mess up game any way , shape , or form unlike many other games . other games , you cheat , it price . usually expensive one . outcast , you cheat , its free !!! there one problem i this game glitches . there aren't many affect gameplay but sometimes walls flashing it gets sorta annoying . my cousin who beaten game least 10 times discovered many glitches , including room where tavion standing you walk through her , room filled lights contained three floating at-sts , even room mountains painted ceiling ( i actually found last one ) . but its kind fun , discovering these weird rooms . there quite lot them ! wow , just writing this makes me want play game ! i'm gonna go play it ! i remember when outcast $49.99 . now , price gone down $40.00 !! nows your chance !!! buy this game !!	1

graphics : 7/10 . well , we talking ps1 port . so don't expect much here . but new cgs nice , even old ps1 sprites actually pretty nicely animated . super/special moves ( pws ) rather nice , too . sound : 6/10 . dialoguing very annoying first . it very much apparent moment you start up game , when you go through prologue . once you get used it , it not bad . sound effects seem bit primitive too , but again , this rather old game . btw , fans quickly note , game uses same voice actors pokemon . :d gameplay : 7/10it interesting mix platforming , puzzles , turn based real time combat . personally , i not enjoy platforming part . genera never my favorite , psp diagonal insensitivity makes some jumps pain . combat rather fun original . but after mid game , your characters so over-leveled over-equipped , almost all battles except few boss battles become trivial . replay : 8/10there lot here . chances , your first game , you've missed out " " ending , true ending . standard " " ending pretty mundane . there quite few characters game , you probably not get explore all them until you replay game . personally , i'm story driven player , so once i know plot , i little interest replaying game , but i think many players don't mind going through story again- such players , replay value should fairly high . story : 9/10a most excellent story . many characters you come across rather poignant stories , you learn each them , small reflections your main character . plot weaved very nicely , although it somewhat slow beginning . my only negative that keeping this 10/10 , very last scene- it somewhat left me unfulfilled . but i hear that matter opinion	1
this really fun game . it got quite lot . graphics , length , characters , story ... graphics : 8/10 dayum ! reminds me dating sims ... but , nice . characters crisp special ingredient known anime eyes ! sound : 7/10 voices ( or lack ) nice . scolding nurse kinda funny . music isn't nice ... theirs only 4 different music thingys i only liked one ... one plays when doing normal guiltstory : 8/10 i wish i could've normal surgeries awhile before encountering super parasite thing based off 7 deadly sins ... controls : 9/10 it ds ... touch , drag , touch again . pretty simple ... overall : 9/10 nice game that easy understand hard master . but this not game kids . blood isn't bad there isn't much gore , but it very hard game beat ! there suicidal patient which my mother didn't really like =\	1
this fun game play . i am 2nd mystery solve . i love these types games . this one sort like trace memory , alot reading it . i am adult woman . my 11yr . old son says it doesnt think he would want play it though .	1
i purchased copy game year edition end may , 2006 . it now almost september . i playing morrowind three months most week day evenings 4 hours most weekends 12 hours . game great graphics , character interaction fairly intricate though times repetitive , game ai monsters non-player characters fairly advanced , game manipulation fairly easy learn , layers complexity somewhat challenging though not overwhelming , most importantly one or two puzzles i come across thus far straightforward resolve . most various quests not terribly intricate difficult so they lend themselves jumping few hours then taking break . i wanted game would visually appealing , simple game manipulation mechanics , interesting but easy puzzles , mysteries , above all provide immersive virtual world explore . i wanted inexpensive game would run older 900mhz amd thunderbird nvidia fx5200 128mb video card 1 gb ram . morrowind fits bill nicely . i ignored all faqs manuals how play game most those provide spoilers instructions most opportune or expedient path . i discussed game some my students who moved oblivien , fourth game series . all all , this best 20 bucks i ever spent game . previous this i played call duty civilization ii extensively some other strategy games bit . i play dungeons dragons group friends college some 20 years ago so fantasy ideas embedded game familiar	1
where begin .. there so much say this game , because there so much . this game massive . i just recently picked it up , i cannot believe i waited this long play it . i heard lot good things morrowind friends , online reviews .. it confirmed , i am hooked this games . there few important things point out it , however , this game definitly not everyone .. yes , this adventure rpg .. massive one . it not same format games such final fantasy , chrono trigger , star ocean , ect .. sure , it takes quite some time get your destination if you travel long distance , but this game real time , island massive .. not mention there so many lairs scattered around world , which makes ton exploration top your already robust agenda . character customization this game par if not better than all other character customization tools i used single player pc rpg . this mind , this game takes least some commitment . i able advance my nord battle mage just fine , even though i somewhat busy schedule .. you not need 24 hours free , but it still good play it when you because it habit calling out you saying ' play me , play me . ' , it adicting . you choose your own path this game . if you into fantasy , character development , real time environment sense adventure , this game just may what you looking	1
now i'm new tony hawks series ; fact only time i've played it before thug demo which i enjoyed but not so much tasks collecting letters stuff like , ( even though those who love type stuff they " classic version " original tony hawks thug 2 ) . these games offer ever insightful approach exploring your world off skateboard . especially thug 2 , since thug i returned it same day i got it christmas merely because i felt dizzy , until i got same feeling thug 2 but then i realised you got all songs not just rock , but hip-hop well few others . anyways story intriguing you travel world doing various tasks such breaking pipes skating combos church . possibilities endless , plus you alien-lovers out there you unlock outer-space world plus many others . short , not best review you've seen true , but game much more than just skating which great , ( i mention you switch characters tony himself bigfoot ?! )dila	1
two great rpg one package . playstation owners who began final fantasy 7th installment finally see what all hype vi . final fantasy also great game , first series where you spend alot time menu combining abilities accessories/equipment customize your characters . only downside short load times when entering battles/opening menu/entering new levels . however , these never last more than few seconds . whether you're discovering snes generation final fantasy first time or re-visiting classics , final fantasy anthology offers great gaming experience you only get console	1
don't get me wrong , both games anthology excellent . i would consider final fantasy vi , greatest rpg ever created . but " greatest hits " version this package dissapoint . original black label version anthology created squaresoft , included package extra cd , music both games . however , black label edition out-of-print some time . newly formed company , square-enix decided re-release anthology " greatest hits " , but excluded music cd package . so , instead receiving three disks ( two gaming disk , one music cd ) , only two game disks included game . square-enix release anthology feels much more like cheap cut-and-paste copy final fantasy . besides lack music cd , much artwork previous black label release gone , instead , gaming disks designed standard white label . final fantasy anthology square-enix , certainly not collector item , despite what package label might say . it my suggestion pass this purchase up , find copy black label release squaresoft .	1
i played several nancy drew games this far best one . i recommend this game anyone .	1
great uncomplicated game decent graphics just right amount quot ; spookinessquot ; . i loved puzzles which weren't overly difficult solve hint system very very good helping me get over one or two puzzles which not seem make sense . marble-in-the-hole game little irritating but all other puzzles solvable even trial error basis . this game probably not people who like complex plots puzzles but game novice i enjoyed it little disappointed when game ended ( little abruptly ! )	1
my husband brought this game home i thought , " oh no , i guess we're not multisyllable conversations next few weeks ... " but my surprise not only he absolutely love this game but i would sit next him watch , totally transfixed amazing detail effort creators poured into this game . i caught myself saying , " baby , aren't you going play your game ? " this game incredible while i am not all gamer i'm tempted try it out ! everyone not shocked gore ( i mean lots gore ) should play this game . every game should this well made .	1
advertising this collection led me believe i would getting these 7 games their original formats ... but i disappointed find not original version kq1 , but sci version released 1990 . kq6 voice commentary instead text , but you switch back text if you like -- i haven't found any such option kq5 , so it looks like you're stuck voice ( no supplemental text , either , so it gets annoying fast ) . i haven't look kq4 yet but everything else seems same . i'll glad play these games without wrestle our old tandy , but i wish they didn't get messed . especially disappointed there no text option kq5	1
i went my local game store buy game get me into christmas spirit . obviously when i asked christmas game first thing woman behind counter said " polar express . " i saw movie last year loved it so i immediately bought game went home play it . i beat game aboout 4 hours , went sleep , when i got up beet it again . it wasnt exactly it short game much it totally fun addictive . i'm 15 , age where most teenagers play violent video games i am sorry say i am one them . game blends everything racing down snowey mountain climbing presents santas sleigh flying blimp . put my review simply this best christmas game possible	1
i really love this game . i'm not much gamer but i really enjoying playing this one , both myself or multi-player mode .	1
make no mistake it , this game more than few bugs sudden desktop crashes . it also one most immersive totally enjoyable games i ever played . i am 59 years old played literally hundreds , if not thousands video games since 70 . this game it all far role-playing games go . one bit advice this game save often save often , save often . oh one more thing , sure save often	1
this game run my $%*#@ computer very well . scenarios story very god ! price very chepest , delivery very speedy	1
this latest ds game i purchased , somehow it happens educational fun . it gives you fifteen different training tasks sudoku boost your brain age ( 20 years best 80 worst ) . they're all preaty neat they all use touch screen or mic . only problem sometimes writing voice recognition numbers words isn't so great . besides , games like math facts sudoku very addictive . so i recommend this cheap price ($15 ) addictiveness , which well worth it	1
if you like these games , you'll love this one ... if you don't , you won't	1
you know , it quite some time since i've found myself glued videogame where my mind hours become seconds . i say myself i'm only going play few minutes -- fifteen , tops -- next thing you know , three hours gone . last game me " gta : san andreas . " i thought there would never game would hook me like . i wrong . boy , i ever wrong . " godfather " ps2 addicting gripping game throws you into world mafia links you classic storyline found film . you play older son score settle . your father wiped out don barzini right front you when you little . don corleone tells you when you're old enough , you take your revenge . now all grown up , you aim serve your godfather move up ranks outsider becoming made man then some . if you're clever enough , you might even become don . if you're ruthless enough wipe out all your enemies , you become don ny . decision up you . game gives you classic storyline we all love know movie , only it involves you . missions very familiar famous scenes we seen over over again . not only , but gta fashion you given lot freedom things your own . you shake down rival businesses using various " negotiation tactics . " need some extra cash ? rob bank . better yet , hijack rival truck steal goodies inside . you're given giant world interact . whether you decide play missions straight through or some freelancing , many opportunities enjoy game . graphics pretty impressive . players who familiar gta games easier time getting used controls various camera angles . look feel very identical . if you want my honest opinion , i actually enjoy this game lot more than any gta games , but that because i'm such fan movie . it great you get relive your favorite scenes part action . cons : missions tricky sometimes even downright frustrating . good majority them timed so it may take you few times get mission just right . i understand timer some missions , but sometimes they get little ridiculous i feel they're just trying throw some unneeded obsticles your path . good news there tons checkpoints each mission , so if you fail or die you not start all over again . also , game glitchy times . now , i haven't seen anything major disrupts my playing all but i've heard some people earlier copies some major problems , so careful . i could go this game , but i'm sure it all said before . you want my verdict ? i love this game think it blast play . " godfather " bound classic . if you're fan movie or gta games , then give it shot . i beat game twice already , i still find myself playing it all over again more more . if you no free time whatsoever , then stay away . this game consume you , whether you like it or not . you warned . offer made . don't you dare try refuse it if you know what good you . - michael cran	1
this game just so intresting game play . loving disney characters fanatic final fantasy series especially ff7 . seeing cloud this game sooooooo .......... cool . playing sora , you travel through worlds disney characters . sure fighting may gotten little annoying but you quickly forget it once you your way new world you go . overall , graphics sweet , storyline even better , voices intresting atmosphere really made this great game should all gaming collections . highly recommended :	1
this game takes place group islands twenty years after events chrono trigger . this game also takes place two parallal worlds hence name chrono cross . this game you ability recruit up 44 characters . get all them you need play through game least 3 times . you probably want play game more times anyway depending how long it takes you understand story line considering it very complex . i wouldn't recommend this game someone who doesn't like rpg or long games . it took me least 50+ hours get through game first time , guide book !!! if you plan getting this game i would also suggest guide book it well . because there somethings you would not find life you unless you something telling where go what . example some characters 7th level tech skills impossible find get without book . you find chrono cross guide amazon well , but beware it usually isn't cheap . if you liked any final fantasy games you would probably like this game well . something else keep mind battle system somewhat different any other game you don't use mp , you use what called elements . these take place magical attacks . there down side elements though when you wish change characters you must remove all elements you character so you place them character . this very time consuming especially later game when you lots element slots fill . beware you this lot . but don't let get you down . this exellant game despite all . all said i would highly recommend this game any rpg fan . hope this review helps .	1
my daughter , age 8 , love game !!! after school when we go out car she playing it	1
shrek 2 amazingly funny movie , all wit graphic animation first . game shrek 2 obviously geared towards kids , but great fun too . game lets you one four characters - shrek , fiona , donkey gingerbread man . each character his or her strengths weaknesses , graphics rather nicely . shrek lands hard thud , fiona floats gently ground , so . you play multi-player , or solo , easily switching characters if you wish . this great family play , where parents hop help out difficult puzzle , or just wander behind child there case trouble . most game collecting items solving simple puzzles . you slam snails get them out their shells get eyeballs . you slow down time so you gather up fairies . all , there fun jokes riddles keep you entertained . not all games high brainpower puzzles or super-fast lightning reflex challenges . sometimes it nice simple game kids really enjoy . i'm really pleased this game out there . highly recommended younger set , parents might actually enjoy playing tykes	1
i loved original lego star wars game . it incredibly fun , very replayable wicked sense humor . lego star wars ii just fun , covers episodes iv-vi!it very rare find game kids play , adults play , everybody truly loves it . this one those games . i'm sure kids enjoy game quite lot - but pretty much every adult gamer i know loves this series well . it fun , it classic scenes star wars movies very funny style , you keep replaying it . you play it friends ! you unlock new episodes , new ships , new characters , you name it . first thing you notice when you enter " cantina " now you make new characters !!! yes , you mix up darth vader head , princess leia torso stormtrooper pants . you mix pretty much any character you find game , give them personalized names ! then you bring 2 your creations into game you free play mode . talk fun !! game gets even better . yes , you work through all classic scenes - luke buying droids , death star blowing up , so " first 3 movies " ( release order least ) . cut scenes very funny . able play various characters amazingly fun story mode , even better " free play " when you randomly switch variety characters find all hidden items . i love stud finding system . you want more money ? just replay mission few times . you get all sorts fun " cheats " ( not cheats , really , but fun add-ons ) , you buy new characters use , much more . it really gives you incentive keep playing . youngster house trouble playing ? just adult pop into game while help out , then adult pop out again , let child keep playing ! it just brilliant . i love this game . graphics superb , last time , little lego movements seeming just right . their swaggers sliders incredibly funny . sound , course , real movie soundtrack superb . you couldn't ask anything better . even tiny touches funny . if c-3po starts getting hit , he loses arm , then arm , then leg . you him hopping valiantly behind you , trying remain your team . chewie rips off arms stormtroopers . now course , there always few things game designers get wrong . while chewie arm-ripping quite funny , it really annoying when he it - very slowly - middle firefight when you wanted him blasting away . characters automatically switch into close combat mode if they think someone nearby , even if you really needed fire away someone blaster . even more annoying , if you're blasting away " destructables " ( wall items , whatever ) your friend gets near you start bashing him ! camera also really annoying . you get * slight * amount view control , but not much . when you craning around trying find mini-kit screen camera keeps swooping wildly exactly where you not want look , it get very frustrating . still , these minor problems game so stellar . i highly , highly recommend this game any gamer any age . it incredibly fun	1
im quite sure your mom probally her eye ds , especially release ds lite games like brain age your mother would want . but i am also sure your mom may not like white color , well that good , becausse coral pink ds make it more fashionable girls , well maybe even attract few guys well ( no , i am not gay , steorotypical or homophobic ) . i say people who first bashed ds , this what you get talking crap . it might astonishing sony getting their butts kicked , after all , ps2 destroyed gamecube terms sales ( same thing ps n64 ) , but some people just don't get psp . that fine , but i like my psp better , basically because my favorite genre racing . ds dosen't lumines or gta . or locoroco , so so . but then again , ds mario , magnetica , whatever . it all depends what you like best most , but since i am no fanboy or like videogames all far reaches galaxy , i enjoy each every system . now system . you know you not want bored tedious details how everythng better all other stuff you basically don't need , but this system ideal even people who original ds . if you like ds , this system update actuallly worth it . stylus way bigger , it certainly looks better , it easier play , better design , better system general . sure , you could say you don't need it , but that fine . although some people ( especially nintedno fans ) , they just can't live without it would definitly take it . myself included , i got one very soon , also , i give props nintendo making sure enough there go around everybody . i white one , but it still same great system , although you would probally choose which color you want . short , don't feel guilty if you shell out 100 bucks , it really worth it . if you don't it , it worth it , you get all kinds cool stuff this fall , includes web browser . so far though , europe gett ing it before us	1
it like cross neon genesis evangelion ghost shell . very cool !!!	1
there only two reasons get this xbox live subscription card . first , gift someone who already xbox live wants renew his subscription . second , normal yearly fee $50 , so if you get this card cheaper than , you'll save money . this card not good way get xbox live if you don't already it . purpose , buy starter kit ( asin b000209v8k ) , which includes free game , headset , year subscription . without headset , xbox live pretty boring	1
nintendo aware manufacturer defect occurs ds lite regular ds game systems come colors ( not silver one ) . plastic hinge closest power supply develops stress crack happens simple everyday use . nintendo refuses accept these cracks defects tries attribute them rough play . we owned 3 ds lites all 3 developed same stress crack , same spot , all within 2-3 months owning them . first one cracked enough render unit unplayable . same happened friends ours . while kids kids , my kids certainly aren't playing touch football their dss . there dozens websited dedicated this problem ( just takes little googling ) , some attribute it overtightening during manufacturing . nintendo not cover this repair under warranty but nice enough reduce $75 repair fee $50 . so when choosing nintendo ds lite , ask yourself if you want brighter screen or sturdier unit . my 7 year old son who his 2nd ds lite just asked if he could original one christmas	1
both final fantasy iv chrono trigger excellent games ( ct could my favorite game all time ) . final fantasy iv excellently restored its original " hardtype " version . story elements dialog restored , which extremely exciting . however , i complaint port . somewhere port , code saving game not optimized playstation but instead uses version works fine solid-state memory ( like cartridge , which these games originally ) but horribly when going cd solid-state . this serious flaw , saves take up half minute complete . why this game gets 3 stars overall	1
i played this game back ' 91 when i 21 watching 21 jumpsteet . even dumbed american version(of this game ) fun time only good form entertainment . ( better than 21 junkstreet jonny dork hollie ugglieson stupid werewolf show whatever lame coorprate pc bull -- show we xr availible watch back then . ) sir ceicel black knight turned prettyboy paladin talk day back when ; even though it knocked today . nintendo power nothing but good things say this game ceicilboy(and course you could change his name ) . i only wish they would release this gba instead big consoles so i could play it bed like lazy () i am . ffiii actually title not released all america instead faked ffiii(v ? ii ? ??? ) . altough i like final fantasy ( i got reinterested when i got ff dawn souls gba ) thier lot grandiosing such space travel modern stuff mixed midevil settings i think inappropriate . i think it should only midevil mystical ff1 2(japanese 1 , 2 not us 1/ 2 ) why cece , rosa company go friggen moon . cartoon amimea weird way but i beveve some lameness replaced better plot this time around japanese version ps . i still rate it five before after except moon crap machines .

difficult learn awkward user interface - besides , this best turn-based strategy game i ever played ! it ideal offline-multiplayer ( serverbased or via pbem ) , since all players take their turns simultaneously , which allows pbem games finished within reasonable time . highly customizable . os independent . disappointed walordsiv , i am now very happy finally found cute , playable , turn-based fantasy strategy game	1
those who dont what it nintendo reader add goes into cartridge slot gba sp ( unsure game boy micro ) . there paper thin slot bulky add which you scan cards play classic nes games , game watch games , animal crossing cards , mario bros 3 cards , pokemon tcg cards or promo cards given out through nintendo power such kirby slide . scanner easy use little trouble reading cards . whats included : included one new reader reader accesory , classic nes game donkey kong jr , sample pack which includes : 3 pokemon tcg cards ( machop , machoke , machamp ) , one game watch card ( manhole ) , animal crossing present card . classic nes games : reader classic nes games sold packs now retail 1 or 2 dollars each . pack 5 cards code top bottom , when scanned create perfect playable nes game . you might thinking if game glitches or any other problems answer no . only noticable difference donkey kong jr game screen appears bit smushed fit screen . classic nes games main reason buy reader cause there great quality quantity . mario bros 3 cards : cards when linked game boy advance/sp super mario advanced 4 : mario bros 3 create levels , show video demonstration secrets , or give you power ups . pokemon trading cards : whenn nintendo bought pokemon trading card game they aded some special features . all cards pokemon ex series codes bottom when scanned give you information pokemon . now heres where reader true poteneial shows , some cards codes side when combined pokemons evolution's(other form ) side codes create minigame . 3 pokemon cards included minigame when combined giving you perfect demonstration . also included pokemon ruby saphire card when combined reader lets your team battle series trainers . animal crossing cards : while linking game boy advance reader game cube animal crossing you give yourself items letters using special machine located animal crossing post office . game watch cards : using one card 2 bar codes it you play game watch game . only one card ever created man hole . game watch series planned but later dropped . mario party : thhe only reader game its own category : mario party includes 64 cards game board instructions . this mixture board game video game you scan various cards play minigames get coins or items your opponent . overall : reader now abondoned nintendo meaning most likely no new games ever released ( it this way 2 years ) . it cheap buy works wonderfully . but due lack any future support you should only buy it if you nes games , animal crossing , or pokemon ex cards . if you into any those than you love this product i recomend it .	1
square disney coming together bring us video game turned out really good move , i think . kingdom hearts ii improvement over original . maybe not big improvement , but enough consider purchasing . graphics really good difficulty unfortunately , sort easy . game really big contains monster storyline so it not like easiness means you blow through game lazy saturday afternoon . it just means you won't much trouble moving through game . i guess axel fairly challenging fight . some other fights sort difficult , well . i'm not entirely sure what think idea complete certain tasks order progress forward , but i guess it not big deal . worth buying ? absolutely	1
i play adventure games regular basis i really enjoyed this game following reasons : 1 ) storyline well put together made sense2 ) scenery quite breathtaking3 ) puzzles range quite easy extremely difficult , but there always chance get hints or ( if you spent way too much time puzzle its time move ) you get solution4 ) main character interacted others regular basis . i'm so tired never encountering person adventure games ! 5 ) i initially thought characters going quite shallow predictable , but things change ! great job this one !! it certainly one my all-time favorites	1
this games just great , i found funny play everything it almost like game , controls very easy , graphics quite nice , music too . great choice	1
first off , this game very addicting so much fun . prince persia : two thrones really takes you back what so great sands time . one thing i really found enjoyable this game story . you really find yourself attached certain characters it brings you into game . great thing this game gameplay , which again brings player back greatness sands time . one thing i fing great all action encountered throughout game . ability sword slash through enemies gives this game nice balance . without this , game would purely platform while this could fun , it definetely needs action keep it feeling alive . ability use quick kills also very entertaining . bosses game also fantastic . each them very different way you fight them which something i found help keep game fresh . some very platform feeling way you fight , others much more action quick kill like . cool addition two thrones dark prince . although times he seems bit overpowered , addition him well needed made game very fun . overall , i thought this game brought back feel sands time although it still lacks slightly gameplay than first , it still great definetley better than warrior within . presentationthe story great keeps player attached this game . it truly back its roots people who liked sands time going love this game . graphicsthe graphics this game very nice environments fantastic . soundthe voice acting this game fantastic ! music also great definitely creates nice mood game . gameplaythe gameplay great ! i love quick kills they truly add new demention game . lasting appealthe game feels bit short , beat 7-10 hours . although there unlockables , there isn't much incentive play through game all way through second time	1
this excellent game . people who love this type game impressed great graphics really step up years past . i would recommend this game anyone who interested playingt this style game .	1
sure , graphics most significant update since tekken 2 . namco very careful keep gameplay mechanics perfectly tact . however , tekken 5 bgm tracks didn't seem keep pace innovation . few good songs here there , but overall , not cohesive ost .	1
if somebody came up you said , " here , some super powers " what would you ? well , incredible hulk ultimate destruction basically allows you take super powers , run rampant them just any way you want . while it doesn't contain level violence or crime grand theft auto , ( lets face it , that what everyone comparing this game ) it doesn't need . it also not contain depth story gta so good . but lets face it , when you elbow drop onto someone head 50 stories up , you sacrifice some things . when you hurl tank into helicopter watch them both explode almost able feel impact explosion , everything else just kind fades into background anyway . i just beat game few days ago , i don't even remember first few story missions , because i spent so much time just running through city , smashing things jumping skyscraper skyscraper , thoroughly enjoying every second it . you lose yourself this game play hours without realizing it just like you gta , but instead getting frustrated game , you actually feel sense relief each time you pound one your opponents mercilessly into ground repeatedly stomp thier heads , let out growl , kick them across street . anger management never felt so good ..	1
i'm not 1st/3rd person shooter fan . but this game graphics sheer re-playability won me over . i actually played battlefront ii before i , but original seems much much better than seque l.p.s. best star wars game ever : x-wing alliance . what i say , i'm old-school	1
when i upgraded 360 i bit saddened i would not able use my controller built fan , but these wireless controllers amazing . first , wireless . no tangling , no mess , toss your controller wherever , pick it up , walk around , sounds bit unnessacary , but it definatly nice . also , middle " button " these new controllers amazing also(although , i'm sure they're wired controllers ) quick access your music , friends , dashboard game . plus , turn off controller or whole console comfort your couch	1
i serious problems wireless controllers previous generation consoles . let serious , wireless controllers gamecube , ps2 original xbox horrible . you stand within like 10 feet tv , if someone turned radio house , your controller would not respond . i no such problems w/ 360 wireless controller . this one works great ! i got mine 360 premium package , i plan buying one soon . i love format new 360 controler xbox button center . controller turns off after like 30 min not using ( during movies etc ) but you turn it again just pushing button . console responds just fast wireless controller wired one . microsoft definetly created greatest game controller ever built . i definetly not see myself going back wired controller any time soon . there no reason why 360 owner should not this !!	1
i am huge star wars fan , but i don't really like rpg all much ( least not video games ; i play dnd ) . said , this game absolutely blew me away . dnd player , i knew there wouldn't learning curve game since it uses d20 system . knowing system really helped feat selection such , there really wasn't anything outlandishly new . i , however , little disappointed small number force powers game . i don't think i would bother my main character jedi consular , you really get decent amount force powers even jedi guardian ( if you some wisdom enhancing items , you use those powers often well ) . character creation system pretty standard . i slightly disappointed you human , i really wanted create lightsaber-wielding wookie , but purpose story , it won't take you long figure out human definitely good thing taris . fact wookie eventually joined my party later adequetely mollified me . fact , it really doesn't matter too much what kind character you make , because party members you pick up throughout game pretty much everything covered . one small warning without giving too much away : your travels you meet party member , order explore his backstory you need your main character decent rank repair skill . it not really big deal if you're set making soldier/jedi guardian amazing melee combat but not able raise skill too much . but you perfectionists like explore every single aspect game , you should keep this mind . note you perfectionists : you not explore every aspect game one run . this because your actions throughout game determine whether you become hero light side force or fall dark side . naturally , there two different endings . i imagine game experience bit different well . i personally stuck light side , which little more difficult times since you'll helping people more . however , this also means you more side quests . i imagine dark side would somewhat guilty pleasure , you just kill people seek your aid you progress through game little faster taking " quick easy path . " there also third option pretty much balancing yourself neutral . respond evil sith occasionally , sometimes valiant jedi . you usually respond neutrally well . overall , i'd say aspect this game shines brightest story characterization takes place ( this reason stick light side : oftentimes you just tell your party members shut hell up gain dark side points , but you won't get explore their backstories discover their motivations ) . anyone star wars fan thoroughly enjoy playing game story nearly on-par movies ( even better than prequels ! ) obviously story bit restricted since it video game meant played , but plot certainly better than any video game i've played before ( when i younger i play games like golden sun baldur gate ; kotor beats them hands down ) . most it pretty new territory , game takes place few thousand years before movies . i'll close few warnings . first , you'd better good graphics card if you want play this game . you should fine if you meet minimum system requirements , but first time i tried install this game my older computer ( still not old though ) it didn't good enough graphics card . computer it now still doesn't meet recommended system requirements , but it more or less fine . leads me into my final warning : there some bugs game . after only few hours , certain point game would freeze up , occasionally exit windows . i worried i wouldn't able complete game because it happened many times . i downloaded updates game , this help some , but it didn't completely solve problem . eventually i turned off something silly like grass effects or shadows caused it happen much less frequently . i guess all left say if you're star wars fan you should buy this game . even if you're not , it still worth playing through , especially if you like rpg . oh , this goes without saying , but quick save often .	1
i haven't finished this game , though i'm quite close it . i say this game quite possibly most fun i've long time . i laughed out loud more than few times , nearly constantly smiling , thoroughly amused all little details . not much stylus action , but then again ... you really expect there ? my boyfriend highly considering getting ds lite simply so he play this game .	1
christmas i bought this item my child who very into likes this product . i thought , " what cooler than video game workout !? " . so , me very loyal amazon fan ( who buys everything amazon ) , decided purchase it . it arrived time . my child very thrilled play it . my whole family dissapointment , eye toy camera sent game apparently broken . ok , amazon . i would rather you keep your eye toy camera that broken until you send us whole package actually works . later , my whole family played this game neighbors house . extremely fun when camera actually works . replacement camera should here soon . very furious amazon	1
easy game championship mode , best when played multiplayer mode . hours hours fun playing against friends family . must	1
all i say squaresoft out themselves . it truly masterpiece feast eyes . i lost it story , creativity , music , charcters . beautiful !	1
i enjoying playing this game . once you get used speed brake nos button , your your way mastering this game . this defenitly beats need speed2 : hot persuit . 1 . i think game could better if they us race night through city streets buildings aglow like new york or las vegas , couple races . 2 . i am getting my cars pretty fast i try win game , my last wish this game , bad roads end before you really see how fast your car go , whether your racing or free time . i always seem stop or brake sooner than i'd like road curves race track keeps going . i am fun game anyways . milestones requirements give game nice touch it adds more fun game you try accomplish task avoid getting your car impounded . good game ! - m.o.	1
i rented this game before i bought liked it so much i just too buy it	1
caesar 4 getting reputation riddled problems . this unfortunate , game itself fine effort developers tilted mill . they achieved admirable balance maintaining elements earlier caesar games , providing something new . improvements certainly graphics game , also distribution system . where c3 you make absolutely certain walkers not options which way they could go , this no longer matters . still , you need build certain way if you wish success . like many others , i crashes when first installing new game . tilted mill tech forum very helpful , turned out i needed install patch my athlon dual core cpu , get all windows updates . you need up date drivers goodly amount free space your hard drive if you want this game run well . that way it , like i said its pity because it cost this game some sales . this game , while enjoyable , lacks depth its predecessor c3 . while many played game , few played it really well , due its unravelling complexity . new game seems deliberately avoided this sort situation , it should easy someone familiar this kind game play high level fairly quickly . music this new game , keith zizza , worth price ammission alone . here major improvement c3 , which quite good music itself . there map editor included , but it quite difficult use , prone crashing , doesn't appear any help file incorporated . it hoped longevity game this addressed . it not lost tilted mill/sierra although c3 made some eight years ago , it still played competitively , due wholly ability players produce good custome-made scenarios . caesar 4 great game . you build truly stunning cities it , more so than any other citybuilder . it pity this means purchasers may need little bit system tidying up get it work properly .	1
if you loved original age mythology- this great followup ! it would better if campaign part bit longer but it still great fresh addition this game . addition titans adds whole new dimension . one only hope microsoft come out expansion celtic/chinese mythology too	1
it time nintendo came out sizable memory unit hold large amount information . before now , one rely off-brand cards ( such nyko 8 mb ) large saves , they susceptible data corruption loss saves . basic save madden , mvp baseball , or any sims games often took up most regular 251 block card . saving more than -- season or franchise -- only possible off-brand cards whose record reliability tenuous best . ( imagine saving season madden losing it when card became corrupted ) . nintendo-brand cards excellent record stability reliability . if you need large card saving sports or sims games , this perfect	1
this game alot like call duty 2 . graphics better than #2 . play almost same . online play where game thrives . online play better than #2 , you get refine your choice game . if you love shooters you love this game .	1
castlevania : dawn sorrow latest iteration konami decades-old franchise first appear nintendo ds . don't let title fool you ; this really isn't dawn anything , except maybe bunch more castlevania games ds . subtitle here simply workable way include letters title game , seems requirement platform this point . dawn sorrow actually takes place year after events aria sorrow , which came out 2003 game boy advance . if you've played game -- or if you've played just any recent castlevania game actually--you'll right home dawn sorrow , because it basically same game repackaged fit ds . isn't bad thing though , because castlevania games long carried torch good , old-fashioned 2d side-scrolling gameplay , dawn sorrow keeps flame burning bright ever . star dawn sorrow soma cruz , young adventurer who narrowly avoided becoming next dracula aria sorrow . soma ability collect souls monsters he kills , thus inheriting their powers . year after soma escaped dracula castle , mysterious woman named celia shows up attacks him . celia priestess new cult attempting resurrect dracula . since soma already proved once before he capable foiling resurrection dark lord , cult decides eliminate him before he mess up their plans well . soma survives attack quite easily celia forced retreat . apparently soma doesn't take kindly people who try kill him , so he sets out find celia prevent her reviving dracula . entire game takes place cult base , which replica dracula castle . true castlevania form you'll start off relatively weak , only knife some mediocre armor . you progress through areas castle , you'll fight monsters search mazelike hallways where you'll gain experience , well find new better equipment . you gain experience , you'll level up your stats increase attack , defense , strength , constitution , intelligence , luck . throughout game you'll also collect souls monsters you kill . these souls equipped give soma new abilities . there three types souls you equip , well ability-type souls grant you special powers without equip them . ability souls collected when you defeat bosses , these abilities usually required progress through game . using these ability souls soma learn how double-jump , move underwater , break crystal blocks -- all which required access certain areas castle . castlevania : dawn sorrow sticks close tried-and-true formula , so it instant hit anyone affinity sort explorative gameplay series known . while it doesn't much distinguish itself first castlevania ds , updated look , excellent music , added controls help refine series even further . bottom line : whether you're familiar series or not , you can't go wrong dawn sorrow .	1
if you like diablo 1 ..... this exactly same game ... only improved 300% percent . if not blizzards bnet all multiplayer options i would say this game also better than diablo	1
" i've played half-life 2 , " " battlefield 2 , " this more enjoyable what it ... now multiplayer , bf2 better far too . detailed graphics , hl 2 better . but , single player experience open ended routes your objectives , good graphics , engaging ai , huge open environments , different types opponents , guns , maps , so , this great game ! i replayed whole thing once many levels many many times . i would recommend this over any other first-person shooter i've played . multiplayer , bf2 , cs , or desert combat ( which i think i liked best maybe those ) ... but stand-alone : far cry . i hope crytek hurries up makes some new pc game their engine , which blows bf2 out water ... someone should ... even though bf2 great game .	1
i hearing reading all rave over this game , i finally got it myself . you tell my giving it high " star " rating , i really like it , so i'm raver now . however , if you've not played it but used first person shooter ( fps ) games , you may find this one somewhat unique . main difference far cry other popular fps games like halo doom series , this game not fast paced . far cry requires more sneaking around , use cover , diversions , etc . all all , it requires more tactical approach , rather than " bust room mow ' em down shotgun " approach . but still , there certainly intense moments just every stage where action hot . technical side : this game very robust requires array strong computing components run it . install requires 4gb . i dell w/a 2.6 ghz processor , 512 mb ram , 64 mb geforce 4 mx video card . it runs game no problem , but i one little code modification regarding directx 9.0 , but easy . i would highly recommend 128 mb video card so you run game richer graphic settings . if you like me , you prefer using game pad rather than keyboard mouse , you're out luck . there just no option any other method control . however , much i prefer my logitech rumble pad , i've found keyboard/mouse just fine this game , actually precision good mouse probably preferable . so , if you haven't got it yet , check it out !	1
this particularly good game our younger kids , though our 9 year old able finish entire game weekend . our 7 year old continues enjoy it without same degree frustration he experiences some other games bit too old him . this game great even though kids not seen movie	1
i start off saying if you own 06 version , then dont bother updating , you may not notice many updates/upgrades . this awesome game ? yes , but it few holes even still ; 1 ) too much sacking your qb cpu . 2)the cpu run ball so darn often , it joke . 3)the game might strain your ps2 it loads so often , 4)if you want play all-madden level , you forced play qb vision , which we all know stinks ! basically , they tossed few more options so you play blocker or etc offense you more advanced defensive controls such match-ups , assignments , etc . also , franchise mode still really great superstar mode quite enjoyable well . what this game really good ? well , it safe say graphics quite good commentary solid once again . crispness passing great running game big part this years focus . it still really fun running qb strong arm , it easy way dominate game ! btw , new kicking scheme actually really easy after test it out time or two , now i am making 90% fg easily ! you fully tinker ai change all other settings well . rosters also accurate but personally , if you own madden 06 , wait 4-6 more weeks then buy this one $19 ps2 best game	1
this system great parent or kid looking some fun . you save few dollars if you buy core system then 20gb hard drive , but it not worth it get core . this system hard drive come wireless controller , which great . you play xbox 360 hours . this console way better than ps3 , sense price . ps3 little better graphics , but cost console outrageous . if you looking holiday gift teenager or even college kid , xbox 360 way go . also , if you planning buy one person online , if it seems too good true , then it too good true . xbox 360 w/ hard drive pro's: wireless controller 20gb hard drive ethernet cable con's: nothing worse xbox 360 core pro's: nothing better con's: wired controller no hard drive no ethernet cable playstation 3 pro's: little better graphics 60gb hard drive available wireless controller available con's: online sucks ! overheating possibilityall all , xbox 360 w/ 20gb hard drive better than xbox 360 core , ps3	1
fun game . you actually dance play once you master game . only thing i think it needs more fast/dance songs more innovative dance moves ( although you create your own dance chart ) . otherwise , fun time , price right . enjoy	1
after playing disgaea 1 , i tried vain satisfy my srpg thirst every game nipponicchi released afterwards , la pucelle , phantom brave , makai kingdom , alas , not one compared greatness disgaea . but it safe say disgaea 2 not only good digaea 1 , but better ! graphics this one better , music takes you back good old days , when rpg music memorable . there few needed tweaks battle system here there . however , there also some additions disgaea 2 some people may or may not like , such item world pirates , incredibly strong characters show up randomly item world make life miserable any unfortunate cross their path . main characters not seem lovable laharl , etna , rest disgaea 1 crew , but i guess they'll grow you after 200+ or so hours your likely spending them . speaking which , i gotta get back now , those very same item pirates just killed adell ..	1
i'm avid final fantasy ( ff ) fan . when i found out they making game devoted my favorite male character , vincent valentine , i stoked . after pre-ordering this game , waiting forever get it , i expecting usual action-packed fighting detailed storyline seen almost all ff games . sadly , though , i little disappointed . dirge cerberus first person shooter ( just you , armed enemies lotta guns ) based final fantasy vii character , vincent . gameplay pretty decent , multitude different enemies fast-paced gameplay ... times . graphics , however , biiiiiiig let down after initial fmv sequence . guns pretty basic far usage , but equiptment system confusing materia system just plain weird first . i'm not even going start item limits ... game isn't overly difficult or overly easy offers few different modes gameplay , easy-hard , unexperienced veteran players . voice acting pretty decent i personally thought voices matched most characters well . now , story . any ff fan should know how much let down these last few ff vii sequels ( movie games ) . they're not bad sense game development or outward beauty , but sense storyline . dirge cerberus takes story complete tangent . lucrecia vincent past given series cut-scenes chance encounters while new , completely out-of-the-blue characters come make difficult process finding out vincent dark history . though it casual flare any ff storyline , it more so resembles two ff movies its science fiction/wannabe horror elements . old characters brought back , new frustrations raised ( hinted ) love interests nothing ever seem go right planet once again . overall , this game isn't bad . it isn't great , but it isn't bad . avid ( very avid ) fans series should check this out if they wanna know what really happened ( though they should watch carefully things didn't match first game ) . if you're player new series , play ff vii first or you won't get full impact game . if you don't really care just checking this out heck it , don't buy it . your money better spent good first-person shooter like metal gear solid	1
just got this game christmas , excellent graphics such , lots fun , feels like movie . only thing i don't like i get frustrated when i get stuck somewhere , i'm anxious go see what else this game store . i recommend this game	1
if your tired all first person shooters rpgs ... this game rocks .. it 1990 all over again me .. love game .. since i didnt anm original playstation i only comment 3d effects they added this version make game more appealling me :) only issue i you cant play 2 player .. but i forgive .	1
other than r-type snes , i've never really played muuch else terms series . however , i'm glad say i purchased this one ps2 . graphics control aside , i think it game mechanics which make this such fun game . basics original essentially same ; you fly ship around , blastng your way through hordes enemies endless assault lasers obstacles . however , what set this baby apart rest your weapon system . you attachable bit front your ship which released , allowing you place it front or back your ship , or just let it roam . this means you fire behind you . pretty cool . plus , bit itself absorbs most bullets , so it used shield , which after absorbing enough energy , allows you unleash large explosing-type shot . coupled charged shots , customizable bits missiles , there lot room technique . plus , there 101 different ships you you use , each their own weapons systems bit missile selections ( which surprisingly unique ) so you won't run into problems redundancy . other than difficulty sometimes slow pacing game , ( not mention slow-down issue times)this must buy all shooter fans . highly recommended	1
i never purchased ncaa football game until this one , i must say i am happy i . i love college feel it brings table . playing texas ohio state game horseshoe crowd going nuts screen shaking awesome !!! i see lot people complaining fact throwing long passes just too easy , but i ask if anyone ever watches college football saturdays ? this exactly what happens week week out college football . reason there more than twice many talented wide outs than there corners college football i feel accurately portrayed this game . i don't any gripes this game except fact rush heisman mode you automatic starter no matter what program you go , you don't ability change depth charts except when game start you this before every game . all all this great game because it my madden 06 disc collecting dust my entertainment center	1

anybody out there controller hog who perhaps gets your controller sticky or messy or something it you don't even want know ? different colored controllers key solving this problem . mr. messy his you yours ! it works out awesome ! i love my teal green controller he loves his blue one ! you also get year warranty , which comes box this controller , yellow cardboard so if there problem year they fix your controller . anyway it same size ones come your original ps2 . buttons same , they move same , feel same . only difference color , but still it worth it get nice new non-sticky controller get your self some distance controller hog . i love this one , they also make teal colored one , i seen sponge bob controller out there well but if its not made sony its probably not reliable . stick best , get sony controller get game	1
gamecube controller- jet ( black)i use controller it ok . i got it grandson use he fun it	1
why mess original . there lot phonies copycat controllers you get discount . you get what you pay . i several standard ones like this they quality . addition controls gamecube similar enough other nintendo products so you won't learn completely new system	1
roughly 30 bones this product really good . my only gripe button text wears off . other than it absolutely great especially if 360 center your entertainment	1
i haven't played video games very long time . i ps2 i used primarily playing dvds . i so excited get wii because i wanted something my whole family could play including my 3 1/2 year old daughter . mini games got us all hooked . i my daughter help when i couldn't it my first time . she would help me shake nunchuk help close door bunnies using bathroom . she would dance music rhythm test when " we " passed test , she would say " you win !

there numerous trends video gaming industry nowadays . those developers sure become sophisticated . one tactics release " classic games " their consoles see if they re-milk market . this , course , come mixed reviews mixed successes . final fantasy iv game boy advance champion game . compared super nintendo entertainment system ( snes ) version ( ff2 ) , i believe this re-make slightly better due increased/updated features game . ( squaresoft retooled some aspects game added some nice features please classic rpg enthusiasts well diehard final fantasy fans . ) i like think ff4gba " upgraded " version original program - similar downloading patch pc game , only , course , it still remains console game . major stand-out benefit i gathered this version game now gameplay flows smoother into final fantasy iii version . ( ff6 you diehards know japanese nomenclature . ) , switching party members - introduced " ff3 . " also , unlocking feature where optional side quests result more loot ! last part this review deals most important topic : cost-benefit analysis . question , you want enroll this common tactic video gaming industry ? $30 worth snes ff2 " patch ? " portable version game ( albeit great game ) meet your desires ? probably most us , we got rid our old nes snes long time ago . ( i didn't - they right next my n64 gamecube . ) lot us downloaded emulators while back now play these games our pcs . i would venture say almost all us who love rpgs don't even care video game consoles anymore gone pc ( more features our games ) . so my recommendation here , leave your impulses behind . yes , final fantasy ii ( ff4 gba version ) classic , great , wonderful games . but nostalgia shouldn't cost this much or require special circumstances taken advantage , my opinion . buy game if you collector or money burn . but always remember , they can't take our memories away	1
counter-strike ! oh yes , pc game seems like it released 15 years ago still #1 online game world . thousands people write reviews this game , all different opinions views game . but shall we look obvious minute ? after 5 years after game released , counter-strike still most played online game , withstanding ultimate test , test time . what other test greatness counter-strike achieve ? millions people still play this outdated game opposed newest , more advanced games . me , sign perfection , achivement worth reconizing . i am tired people putting down counter-strike . " graphics bad , realism overrated ... ect . " game older . accept game what it . it still awesome game everyone should play support . so many times people simply look graphics game make reviews or opinions game . what ever happened most important aspect games , gameplay ? counter-strike best gameplay any game ever made . period . newer games may hands down beat counter-strike graphics but never even come close gameplay original counter-stike . its truely incredible pc game . i've played original counter-strike since its beta . hours upon hours i spent this game no other game ever match ultimate enjoyment gaming than counter-strike . i still find myself , after all these years , awe game . trust me , i've played counter-strike source , doom iii , battlefield 1942 , call duty , half-life 2 , i choose counter-strike 1.6 over all them any day week	1
this game very fun because you able change and/or create your own characters many different ways , there different games you play than just plain karaoke , it ways encouraging you better . each location you choose fun things happen when you sing more tune , like if you sing rooftop building , you're doing awesome , helicopter comes starts filming you live cam ! it lot like american idol how you're glamourized . only thing i don't like it song choice limited . there ways you " earn " new songs doing well , but i wish there way you could add more songs songlist we personally could choose	1
this game new experience me i didn't think i would like it but i , i like story telling it keeps you interested overall , interesting , fun , it entertain you ...	1
those you who played trauma center ds , this game same old same old , but still worth buy you play it full size tv . those you who not played game game one most unique challenging games i ever played . one tell pictures you surgeon , who everything remove glass fighting wierd bug things live inside people . game great port ds wiimote controls great this game . i highly recommend this game	1
we got group 5 friends together guitar hero 1 2 , ddr , now karaoke revolution party . it freaking cool . songs list very good there something everyone . easy figure out too	1
karaoke revolution party fantastic game great songs , great easy gameplay perfect party game features . if you've never tried karaoke game , now time play . first , basic setup . you get fully customize your character . we're talking black , white , male , female , heavy , skinny , athletic . then you go hair styles , hair colors , outfits down shoes jewelry . you evey use your eyetoy scan your face onto face character . it simply amazing . then we go onto song list . i own probably every karaoke game out 3 main systems . i love karaoke games . this song list far my favorite song list all time - it true my boyfriend well . there good mix jumping songs , slow romantic songs , rocking songs more . other karaoke games you go through unlocking venues songs . because this party game , they pretty much give you everything up front , few exceptions . you unlock few songs ton characters / outfits you go , keep things interesting . few standouts include elvis outfit cat outfit . addition able sing both single player duet modes , there bunch fun mini-games . you compete against other players , try play note-matching games even set up eye toy so you see your own background game . even better , if you dance pad , you sing dance same time ! this really great building up your vocal powers . many people sing fine if they stand still like stick , but when you sing band you're actually expected move around dance . using dance pad helps you build up your lung power timing so you get those skills . even if you're not band , you see challenges your favorite singers face . this game ton fun both friends party mode , or just singing yourself songs . where some previous versions karaoke sometimes " questionable " versions songs , them obviously different original , these songs great sounding many times i didn't look song bar all sing them . highly , highly recommended !! rating : 5/5note : previous reviewer says this aretha franklin version natural woman . i'm rather sure it carole king version	1
square enix best rpg developer planet . valkyrie much fun ffs 1-10 , graphics , sound , control , fun all present valkyrie profile 2 . i highly recommend this title	1
my experience developer tri-ace games dates back original playstation era star ocean : 2nd story . like most gamers this side world , this probably one first tri-ace titles created enough buzz form niche fans . other game , which credited simular yet even bigger buzz , original valkyrie profile . unfortunately , yield initial pressing run game so low ( so tri-ace wouldn't lose much if game didn't sell or catch ) time i heard hype surrounding vp wanted give game try it much too late ... copies game selling astronomical prices e-bay much like how sealed copies final fantasy vii selling now . because this i ecstatic when sequel - which this case actually prequel - announced so i could finally experience what i missed out first time one form or . granted , vp2 not complete carbon copy original , but majority gameplay elements cross game/generation gap , so essence this game should probably give you idea what original itself like . so , would i say i blown away or impressed what i missed out missing original vp ? not really . start , game simply beautiful . there some dazzling effects , leaves grass waving breeze various types weather pounding some locals . this what one should expect last generation ps2 title . sure , every once while battle camera might clip some polygons so it looks like your characters standing air , but so minor it doesn't matter . only gripe i i wish characters weapons changed depending what they currently equipped . however , since character designs so dependant default look weaponry , above simply wouldn't work very well . combat valkyrie claim fame , much like it other tri-ace games like star ocean . this good thing , considering amount time you'll spend battle mode leveling up game massive number characters ( which only handful actually involved story , others just seem there ) . quick glance , battle system seems button mashers dream , but like good 3d fighting series ( soul caliber or tekken ) those who know what their doing always get further or less difficulty things difficult enough . other combat related issues also sprout up : reviving ally requires you near ally body status effects so not your friend - especially when whole party inflicted once ( especially poison ) * shutter * . fun combat , there quite few hitches aware , such wasting ap dash getting nowhere because your party caught edge " something " environment or when party members become separated same reason , limiting your attack options until you take time go back get them . this becomes especially aggravating when you're trying finish battles quickly efficiently possible receive experience crystal bonuses . change 2d fighting environment vp 3d one vp2 works , but above issues make you yearn 2d battles original which would probably devoid these problems . game skill system area initially seems interesting clever but quickly becomes quite cumbersome . you'll form rune words your equipment accessories unlock new " potential " skills . note word " potential " previous sentence . unlocking new skill doesn't grant character skill automatically - only though battle skill used permanently learned . first glance this good thing since it prevents abuse ( think ffix skill system here ) , but player then quickly finds out it " may " ( well , usually ) take long learn said skill . instead awarded set amount points towards your skills after enemy defeat like most normal rpgs , percentage earned towards potential skills based average level your current party enemy(s ) . because this you'll constantly seeking out stronger stronger enemies you'll hardly ever find " undeniable great place " level up . you'll also contending never ending equipping unequipping equipment while doing this often means your party usually far wearing strongest available equipment all times - something usually given most rpgs . traversing dungeons probably most noteworthy aspect vp2 after battle system . first few complete cakewalk teach you ropes , later ones really test you sanity your brainpower . correct sealstone usage photon know-how go long way towards completely clearing them all their contents . kudos tri-ace awesome auto map feature - features like this need become industry/genre standard ! sound department , motoi sakuraba makes rather subdued yet solid entrance , seeming ditch his rather unique yet unorthodox style composing . it not until much later until you hear piece you know " yeah , that sakuraba , no doubt " . voice-overs good , but same time just few tiers above decent . valkyrie profile 2 also falls victim problems prevalent other tri-ace games . some moments unbalanced gameplay creep up player difficulty goes up few notches without much warning . story once again slow start ( this even surprise anymore tri-ace games ? ) , some story twists you see coming mile away ( one revelation end chapter 3 so freaking obvious ! ) . all this said valkyrie profile 2 worth playing if you've never experienced vp ? yes . however , now experienced it , i honestly think i could waited price drop instead buying it day it came out . despite this , i still look forward playing re-release original psp .	1
gun hyped tps it devoped same team who brought us tony hawk . game takes place 1890 . during old west near kansas begging protraginst cole white man who should age range , 24 , betwenn 29 hunting game his father . which basic tourtoul abord ship attacked indins . ship blows apart but cole survies after 3 days he wakes up edge lake or river or what not . i not spoil rest . but gun takes lot if populrey elements puts it one game . examples include . slow mo shooting max payne you get this nailing head shots or cool ways killing . it works only pistols . but any other gun it would easy . it also goes fps 10-15 seconds you use this . many mature aspects . while always conteversy it also populry . gun youll see lot it . blowing guys head apart watching brain tissue fly while corpse . just sparys froming puddle . scalping what gotten this game contercovsly . sclap when person whos . dieing floor get knife taken there neck . it excatrated say least . also if you kill person cannon there limbs fly . so expect see arm or leg after you blow up dynimyte fire cannon . there also abilty set person fire or stab them knife while 100% still alive there idea epic cutscene . haveing mans fingers blown off slitting thorats . shooting man shotgun out 3rd story window sticking rifle mans mouth then .... pulling trigger . language not what gta , wariors , or godfather . but it keep consistent flow words . word used over dozen times . if you play through game word used almost 50 times . enemys death cry . commanly you ! #ch or son ! $*h free roamgun features 100% free roam side missons included . map not big only 2 citys . but it old west . no cars . or faster transportion then . horse buggy . but horse what you riding most time . epic storyline . games story foucus revange but interduces . implyed sexul acts . backstabbing twists . hearing amazing things . flashbacks . etc saying voice acting also gold thomas janes voice colton pretty much everbodys voice . true fashionthe things complain gun lack online short main game takes 8 10 hours finish .	1
it obvious , " gun " isn't everyone ; i really enjoyed it , friend mine , but i've read many reviews ( both this website well elsewhere ) thoughts quite unlike my own . i've read gamers thought controls too sinewy , or storyline wasn't interesting enough , or even " western " genus alone isn't worth game made it . . . personally , i think that entirely untrue . okay , one : this isn't exactly type " western , " or even close what you're familiar regarding clint eastwood , or john wayne - no , this one entirely different . this among new breed " western " genre we've never seen before , where it more negates predominant hero focuses solely brutality west . much like hbo series , " deadwood , " " gun " not only brings us vivid new creation into eyes unsympathetic frontiersman , delightful mechanics such riding horses , firing bows engaging more-or-less " duel " thoroughfare whichever town you're , if you anger townsfolk enough . i think this sort cruelty not only admired , but enjoyed immensely , if right gamer only give it shot get know controls . setting fresh , its many intricate greed-driven plotlines causing much distress lonely horseman , i think music scored this game only vitalizes objective . two : sound , which ties game score , just powerful it heart-warming . i've never enjoyed firing six-shooter so much game , but granted , there haven't many opportunities me try one out , which reason this game makes such amazing gameplay : it never really before . if given time , i'm sure i could come up few games western-based , but none intriguing tongue-dissolving " gun , " i think even those who didn't like could agree me . short , it just beautiful game , albeit many areas need improvement , but overall plentifully satisfying . there few issues , though : one ; length this game dreadfully short . many opportunities this game given , i would think creators would turn it into twenty-five or thirty-hour game , or least give gamer more sub-missions allocate his time ; but end , this game falls short true masterful selection , those little tidbits just didn't make grain . it great game , long it lasted , but unfortunately just wasn't very long . hope , they'll create sequel , but i pray it'll longer much more enjoyable , horses innate fun ride . all , though , i still say " gun " supreme achievement . i enjoyed playing it , although it incredibly short , i still found it pleasant regardless because end , playing rugged protagonist only seeking revenge often implemented videogames , but i scarcely think many better than colton white . . . well , maybe kratos " god war .	1
i purchased my 360 6 months ago whim loved it ever since . graphics look amazing my plasma hdtv . wireless controls feel great very responsive . xbox live far best online service any console . only other system i am planning buy this generation wii , only because there key titles only nintendo produces	1
not only " we love katamari " way better then first , but you get play prince cousins . some cousins faster , some slower some seem stronger then others . also some katamari earth elements such big snowball katamari fireball one too . fireball kind tricky , you keep fire it burning , if not level fails , also watch out water , it put it out , no matter how big it . last but not least finish " we love katamari " , you need convert your progress " katamari damacy " this one . if you delete first one you memory card , then bad , you'll play first all over again .	1
thought first katamari game addictive ? this one worse . it just like other , only you more levels different types ' quests , ' like cleaning up room rolling up 1000 cranes help out friend who sick . one best parts you play any cousin you found level , there dozens more royal presents . fact , you wear 2 once ! king still hilarious . fact , every time you beat major level , you get short little cut scene his past . you even get hear him speak ( japanese ) end . huge treat me . many people complain graphics . i think simple , blocky graphics greatly suits game . it would lose its charm if graphics good newer final fantasy game . bright colors , funky sound even funkier music just make this game adoreable while making you uttering over over again " what world ...? " there only two complaints i ... multiplayer length game . multiplayer still lacking ; there aren't many levels choose it get little old after while . also , game relatively short . i beat it within 3 days playing it maybe 2-3 hours day . however , this easily combatted side quests . you still find all royal presents ( sometimes there more than one level ) , cousins ( 39 all ; there 4 you find one last levels ) , 3 extra levels you obtain after you ' beat game . ' ending credits even level . this why it loses one star ... it really more 4.5 star . conclusion , we love katamari great game . it'll you hooked . i reccomend it anyone who hold controller . that only skill you need play it . :) sense creativity , course	1
working u.s. air force some odd time , noise cramped jet cockpit 30,000 lb-thrust jet engine just 20 feet behind you , noise just too unbearable they give us laboratory designed tested earpices really help , might i add these things perfectly balanced perfect noise-cancelling levels like ones we get . so if someone your living room talking you , everyone xbox wouldn't hear , but it only takes soft voice them listen instead garbled echoy noise you get standard headset , this comes out crisp clean . also it comes 4 interchangable earpieces ( large small rubber large small foam composition . ) now if it big enough jacks , i'd bring this plane me . believe me , this thing worth it money then some	1
i love this game , i've playing it every since it came out . its not one those boring after whilepros : -good graphics-good gameplay-lots mechs-live support-content download ( lot ! ) -up 8 people xbox live-lots missionscons : -can get bit repetetiv	1
i remember when " doom 3 " first came out there lot hype internet . people claiming it would blow away release " half-life 2 " id new engine , etc . etc . etc . unfortunately , " doom 3 " rather standard shoot-'em-up . it fun little while , but it lacks originality inventiveness games like " half-life 2 " ( which amazing ) . " half-life " kept me engaged because terrain changes ; characters change ; so . " doom 3 " it basically just lot walking around through dimly-lit corridors . monsters jump out you kill them . it fun while but then it becomes tiring - much like haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight . furthermore graphics engine really isn't what everyone made it out . i just bought new pc this year it runs this game very well maximum settings - gameplay isn't choppy or anything . but even full potential graphics i think they're just " ok . " shadowing brilliant but textures average some characters cut-scenes downright laughable - one commanders early looks like character " avp 2 , " game came out 2001 ! in-game play much better - characters look more realistic - but i wonder what rush cut-scenes . one would think they'd spend more attention detail these . overall i admit while i found this fun times it gets tedious after while . i mean , gimmick flashlight annoying ( someone else pointed out ) - i think beginning it okay but they should planted upgrade early game , such helmet flashlight attached top ; or nightvision goggles last minute or two before they recharged ; because dropping your flashlight picking up weapon while you're shot enemies annoying . reviewer pointed out , pda gimmick gets old fast . overall this moments absolute brilliance but i felt like so much more could it . they should abandoned concept " alone dark " throughout entire game bit more it - i would loved explored martian planet more or even levels don't look exactly same . because repetitive nature game ultimately what sinks it . it good , but i think " half-life 2 " far better graphics engine hl stunning , even two years later	1
i've bought this game my new laptop like 2 weeks ago graphics great . things i really don't like this game controls not flexible compared some fps games because most levels doom3 pretty dark toggling flashlight weapon same time when enemy appears really tideous . fact quake4 much more flexible controls due attached flashlight machineguns overall game interface . this game not scary long you know enemy patterns habit appearing everywhere	1
scarface world yours ( vivendi games ) one most hyped videos games 2006 . following success godfather game , people couldn't wait get their hands scarface game especially when some reviewers said it good or better than grand theft auto games . game takes what if scenario , i.e. , what if tony montana didn't die end scarface but instead loses everything rebuild his empire . first i start off important matter -- player control movement . comparison past vivendi/universal games i say player control movement very good . next up weapons . i personally felt like aim shooting ability could vastly improved . according tutorial you press l1 target r1 shoot but they failed mention you must use analog stick aim your weapon . maybe you don't , maybe it just me , this isn't instructions but i found more success when i used analog stick conjunction l1 r1 . game begins you your mansion facing hail gunfire enemies . top your balcony you must shoot enemies . then came my first moment " oh this isn't much free world grand theft auto , " when i tried descend left side staircase i couldn't get down it . it like there invisible forcefield . perhaps you need kill certain amount enemies before you descend down left stairs . i made my kills then descended down right side staircase take remainder enemies . there function named blind rage comes out when you press button controller . this function makes tony temporarily invincible . when he dies , screen it says " you f*cked up . " just one example cursing game . word used so much this game adult i wish there would filter change language setting . i literally play game mute because all foul language . scarface-the world yours fun game if you like violent games . i point out gamer rock star games spoiled us terribly . scarface-the world yours you pretty much stay mission or there isn't much . past five years grand theft auto series given us ability perform street races , visit shooting range , import vehicles , gamble , dance , work out , or just walk around mess things up when we aren't mission . scarface-the world yours you basically stay mission . there isn't too much extra when you aren't mission . sometimes game player i get tired shooting so much just want take break something different . i strongly suggest buying prima games strategy guide . it definitely unlocks full potential game . scarface-the world yours overall fun game , but it still doesn't give game player total free open world experience some gta games . but yeah , get strategy guide , it gives player something look forward .	1
this game lot fun , you so much dark humor great . only gripe i it just way short easy . i easily beat this game 3 days , i still 2 days left my rental . i would say rent this game , because you easily beat it within week . so overall , here break down pros cons . pros : -playing pranks students -the missions lot fun-the side missions also lot fun , bring more story-good dark comedy , like all other rockstar games-unlocking funny constumes , like black ninja costume stay out past curfew-all different cliques great , able beat up bully anybody lot funcons : -just way too easy , missions beaten very easily . -incredibly short , nothing like grand theft auto games where it take month unlock everything , i able unlock everything 3 days . -would've loved see some same things gta : sa bully . ex : gta : sa you able gang members follow you what you want . it would've great see bully . overall : i would suggest renting , lot fun , but easily beaten , not worth $50	1
phoenix wright : ace attorney fun game . it simple . graphics ( 4 out 5 ): i would say graphics par most ds games . they could better , but they don't retract all gameplay . they fun same style games like sprung under knife . audio ( 2 out 5 ): audio where most ds games fall short . i am content graphic abilities ds , because quite simply graphics don't make good game . sure they help , but gameplay entertainment truly lies . it knowing this kept nintendo top handheld market . i just wish ds little more power behind it audio sake . i would like speaking characters throughout entire game , especially game like this . music so repetetive , it got so annoying i found myself just turning sound completely off . i guess they best they what they work , but this case , it just not good enough . gameplay ( 5 out 5 ): far gameplay goes , you couldn't ask much better experience . you put role pheonix wright who his first trial defending his best friend who accused murdering his girlfriend . eventually you go work other cases way you required gather evidence use court suppport your defense . characters over top lot fun interact . this text based game i suppose you might fan genre really appreciate it . but it simple pick up play game held my attention beginning end . i really trouble putting it down . while game like sprung got little monotonous came down more memorization then common sense questioning . phoenix stays track area logic plays more part solution cases . i highly reccomend this game !	1

i decided buy star wars republic commando xbox my son , because he won't let me play my pc version . come find out it seems like it plays easier xbox . this game far one best i've ever played . it awesome . i find it very exiting actually feels like part combat squad . everyone team knows pro-active , rather than reactive . i haven't seen game yet , where squad members react direct or indirect fire these commandos it . you don't move your team , they'll their job . you also redirect their orders they follow orders letter . able " inject " them bacta , makes game whole lot better just " finding med kit " , other hand , while you're injured , rescued your crew definitely gives you feeling you team !!! only regret ( just small one ) game so short ( or least it felt like it ) . it only three major campains , game so much fun , it seemed like time flew . i only hope lucasarts decides make republic commando ii ( maybe , based missions omega squad ) ... here hoping . i definintely recommend this game , squad-based combat or star wars fans alike , you'll get kick out it . i'm definintely fan " delta squad , republic commandos	1
i throughly enjoyed this game . voice acting may not greatest , but i think gameplay really well atmospheres fantastic . controls take some getting used too not everyone . they problem could better control , surprisenly i it very well . major problem i game progresses it gives you less times save , so you go through almost entire level ( though short ) complete it without saving once . so stupid because if you die end you entire level over again , dumbest thing ever video game . i just feel it unfair game makers make fairly difficult level then make you it over over if you slip die toward end . stupid , stupid , stupid . levels bit difficult if you're not one quick trigger . much i gripe camera angles , they're useful stopping max end hall , swing camera around see if enemy around corner , waiting steps , right inside next room , etc . it gives you heads up makes it easier stay alive . however , i still really liked it . i didn't enjoy mp2 much , but mp3 ( which should end series i think ) should , ( re : should ) much better . i'm looking forward it .	1
this game race lovers , awesome graphics , car responce just like real thing , photo lab very nice too ( you take pics your rides ) you never get bored this game . must	1

i may not typical game player 36-year-old woman , but i love driving games , this one best driving games ever pc . there something little crazy enjoying speeding through miami streets , running over pedestrians , taking missions hit(wo)man , eluding law . game definitely stirred up lot controversy , but it just game ... adult game ! i loved whole ' 80s miami vice theme , one most enjoyable parts game speeding around town listening awesome radio stations car . you also create your own radio station your mp3s . graphics downtown cars great , but characters little stiff times . however , this not detract considerably fun factor . some missions too difficult , trying get through them over over again became so tedious i find some cheats online . more liberal save feature would nice . result some missions , i still haven't finished game , but perhaps that beauty gta vice city ... it huge you get your money worth . there nothing i hate more than buying game finding it so simple i finish it couple days ... there no risk this game .	1

half-life 2 xbox here , somehow , valve managed squeeze every little ounce gameplay appeared last year hit pc game ... barely . let get this out way now : half-life 2 xbox , terms content , exactly same pc version single-player game , so if you played it pc , there nothing new you here . note we say single-player game , because xbox version lacks counter-strike : source , latest version hugely popular online action game came half-life 2 pc . so , when you get down it , half-life 2 xbox basically just acclaimed single-player campaign half-life 2 . that why half-life 2 xbox comes off bit underwhelming . yes , it fairly solid translation one better first-person shooters recent years , but it also lacks extensive multiplayer mod-making features its pc cousin . half-life 2 , you once again assume role gordon freeman , theoretical physicist dimension-hopping commando who saved world alien invasion end half-life . or he ? half-life 2 starts you off facing infamous g-man , mysterious blue-suited character original . end half-life , g-man offered you choice : work him or die . since there would no sequel if you chose latter , half-life 2 assumes you chose former , so you start game train entering city 17 your introduction into this new world . city 17 run-down urban center that equivalent warsaw ghettos during world war ii ; instead jews rounded up live city 17 , it all remnants defeated humanity . half-life 2 takes place untold number years after black mesa incident , but it clear much changed . mysterious enemy known combine conquered planet installed human puppet government carry out its rule . black-clad security forces patrol streets , while propaganda blares endlessly omnipresent video screens . if there one thing valve extremely well , it capturing sense atmosphere , this vision dystopian police state chillingly effective . but you won't spend lot time soaking scene before you're thrust into struggle defeat combine free humanity . you'll your own during most game , but there levels which you'll opportunity fight alongside allies , both alien human . some best team moments come later , when you're battling combine streets buildings city 17 , large-scale battles going groups humans combine huge , spiderlike striders . you never really develop any attachment your teammates , though , they tend very disposable , replacements available regular intervals . teammates tendency get your way cramped interiors . even though they'll slowly move out your way , it still little annoying . addition taking teammates , you'll occasionally opportunity set up sentry guns assist you defense . toughest sequence we encountered involved setting up handful sentry guns defensive alignment , then holding out against waves incoming combine soldiers . surprise somewhat disappointing performance artificial intelligence . most humanoid enemies don't seem show same kind intelligent behavior they original , even tougher difficulty levels . they'll seek cover then peek out fire , but invariably they'll charge you , which makes it easy take them down . maybe it due some weapons bit overpowered , but most opponents don't present much challenge all -- few rounds usually enough stop them . there few fearsome foes , like larger ant lions , which tirelessly pursue you while you frantically unload every bullet you them . then there strider , 50-foo t-t all , walking , organic tank fires devastating bursts spear you one its legs if you get too close . but most part , half-life 2 surprisingly easy , even tougher difficulty levels . case point end game , which feels anticlimactic : you're given horrendously overpowered weapon use against relatively weak opposition . when you get down it , half-life 2 xbox excellent single-player game . if you didn't get chance play pc version , then you owe it yourself check out game xbox ( even though it not smooth sharp what you'll find pc ) . you'll find few games match half-life 2 quality terms immersion gameplay . all these months after its original release , it still excellent first-person shooter should experienced most every action fan . just don't expect anything more after game ends .	1
half-life 2 pc put x-box sounds like it should work . core gameplay still same good fun once you get few hours into it . graphics decent but won't blow you away like pc versian . so what problem it half-life 2 x-box just little watered down . well there one single problem really irritates me point i would give it three stars . l.o.a.d.i.n.g !!!! this game loads more than you actually play it . it simply ruins action ! your middle tense adrenaline pumped chase your really into it when it all suddenly stops game loads . loading times last seven thirty seconds it really just makes you want swear t.v. screen . half-life 2 x-box isn't bad game but it completley inferior p.c. problem which loading problems well . it possibly worth rental if sit through all constant loading but beyond loading issue it worth playthrough . there no multiplayer single player all your getting so don't buy .	1
this game i would recommend without reservation anyone looking adventure game beautiful , positive , entrancing , funny , inventive , great soundtrack , doesn't involve violence / carnage . i'm 40 completely under spell game weeks weeks . my 6 year old son equally engaged , able complete 40% it without help , himself ( he needed help boss battles , or anything under time pressure ) . you lose hours this game but you won't emerge tense , sore shoulders anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks . same time , it definately not too easy . it just challenging enough . it long thank goodness , because i didn't want it end ! overall tone so positive . you get japanese wolf goddess romping through what detailed , beautifully imagined executed japanese watercolor world . you weapons you take out monsters , but your weapon ink brush , you take out monsters calligraphy strokes . simply brilliant , would make excellent christmas gift adventure game lover	1

ignore anyone who talks this game " shortcomings . " it fun game , addictive game . period . although one reviewer suggests some levels too easy , i say this only goes keep game ( plot ) moving . fact , let face it , when you break tasks down , events typical episode 24 aren't complex . you run , you hide , you shoot things . you drive fast chase people . but you it all , looking , sounding , panting ( yes , video jack bauer even breathes like him ) almost if you show . kiss adage fabulously apt . keeping it simple how game-makers kept it fun . related this comment trying make actual game play last 24 hours . firstly , show itself little loosy-goosey real " hour " what commercial breaks its creative liberties . secondly , each " hour " broken up into smaller missions , learning what it takes well each section take little time . thirdly , those choose complete their missions finesse ( higher scores ) find they're not only coming closer " hour , " they're also more fun , because they're acting more like characters show . after all , i suppose someone who wants complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone , instead just run past enemies ! or better yet , if reviewer really wants take " 24 hour " thing seriously , i'm surprised he isn't complaining able save progress memory card . he really ought asking game that played straight out entire 24 hours , no saving , get it right first time , just like show .	1

yeah this game really fun , just gets extremely hard times towards end . little over 10 hours into it , kind short i guess , but each mission might take you few tries complete . plus fact you might spend 30 tries some like i . i'd say it easily one best games out ds though . one everyone should their ds collection .	1
first off , lemme just say i am nintendo fan , i since i first got nes system [ ... ] years old 1988 . i every nintendo home console since then loved it . i bought gc 2002 really fell love it . i eventually traded it my brother computer ... dumb move . years later i bought one used friend but never played it b/c school sold it . well its 2006 i am buying gamecube today b/c i miss it so much even after getting into pc games like world warcraft half-life . here why : 1 ) system : it flawless . i never seen this system lock up or malfunction , it reads every disk fine . i clearly plays many multiplatform games such resident evil 4 timesplitters 2 best . i like ps/2 games but console itself crap few good games console doesn't really give me enough reason keep rebuy one b/c they crap out . xbox good system , but games nothing you can't really ps/2 besides halo kotor . 2 ) games : sure there lot kid games this system . but there many teen mature games too . many available but aren't obvious find . what so amazing games not only truely wonderful one like metroid prime , zelda , mario , re4 , etc . but all great games nobody ever really plays much . you find many these games gc they cheap probably more fun than most games you ever play any other console . some these include : eternal darknessdie hard vendetta(wow , i loved this game ... there zero advertising it i know of)killer 7agent under fire(not underground necessarily but this game amazing)phantasy star online 1 2soul caliber 2etc . if you really into first person shooters , don't even bother xbox . play pc games , they better graphically seem easier handle keyboard my opinion . if you want load fighting games like tekken or street fighter , ps/2 good but like i said , system really horrible designed , even new slimlines problems . honestly i would pick up ps/1 ebay if you wanna play some great fighters like tekken or king fighters . if you want best gameplay out games great price get gamecube . i'm telling you , i know what your thinking . you walk into video store , see pikmin or super mario sunshine gamecube think ... psh what am i [ ... ] years old ? looks deceiving , this system amazing all games , honestly pikmin me rolling ground it so oddball fun . i give gamecube easily 5 stars , it never let me down what it meant , great games	1

mr. craig clotfelter wrote review earlier matches my sentiments exactly . if you get used ' controls ' get early slowness , this excellent game . i havent beaten it yet havent played it month or so [ computor went down ] . you main quest straight or wander around building your character up , i personally didnt start main till i level 13 even then took it slow easy . you progress game , ar wander area , new towns open up i just sort got new side quests these areas opened up . so i am taking my time . it great game . if you buy it , patience , you wont regret it	1
part elder scrolls series , morrowind takes live action adventure games like zelda series overlays it more traditional role playing stat system ala dungeons dragons . elaborate , player freely explore expansive 3d world first person or third person mode , while practicing improving their character skill set . combat , example , rather than trying work your way through menu system trying cast magic use attack moves etc . ( final fantasy anyone ? ) , player must physically aim swing sword or fire spell his opponent . whether or not bow lands based things like player agility bad guy block skill . thus , unlike game such , say , fable , action doesn't depend much player own reflexes dexterity . little common sense caution goes long way . also , don't expect lots elaborate , teary-eyed cut scenes like story-driven games such final fantasy . real draw this game complete freedom player whoever they want , go anywhere they like , almost anything ( within reason ) . player asked choose name , race , gender , face hairstyle their character , also create basic skill set use ( any combination combat , magical , stealth categories ) . then player given some simple instructions beginning first task main quest simply released into massive world towns , people , wilderness . there main quest follow , but gameplay completely open-ended . it easy become completely distracted caught up endless guild quests random adventures await your character . personally , i've playing this game two half years now , i've still not accomplished everything there this game . i'm not sure i even describe depth this game this review . i've literally spent hours just trying different clothes armor , creating my own spells potions , or reading books ( both factual fictional ) game libraries ( i'd like add almost anything read book found or game ) . i've also spent literally days gameplay searching various legendary unique artifacts trying uncover various mysteries game , such solving disappearance dwarves , finding cure vampirism , locating ( or becoming ) werewolf , how become necromancer ( some which i've found or am close finding ) . i've played most ( if not all ) zelda games , i've played fable , i've played games like dragon warrior final fantasy , i've even played text rpg like adom . they all their good points advantages ( i've greatly enjoyed them all ) , but none them ( not even majora mask ) held my attention this long . elder scrolls iii : morrowind best role playing game i've ever played maybe ( just maybe ) best game i've ever played overall	1
i first version this game , but got newer one , which even more fun . it several more challenges , levels , styles , variety . i haven't yet tried them all , but it worth $$ because different games players you get . plus you unlock different musi play your hands too . both my 13-yr old son i enjoying exercise we get it , this version very similar arcade one , so we practice then go arcade - get our monies worth !	1
now i'm new tony hawks series ; fact only time i've played it before thug demo which i enjoyed but not so much tasks collecting letters stuff like , ( even though those who love type stuff they " classic version " original tony hawks thug 2 ) . these games offer ever insightful approach exploring your world off skateboard . especially thug 2 , since thug i returned it same day i got it christmas merely because i felt dizzy , until i got same feeling thug 2 but then i realised you got all songs not just rock , but hip-hop well few others . anyways story intriguing you travel world doing various tasks such breaking pipes skating combos church . possibilities endless , plus you alien-lovers out there you unlock outer-space world plus many others . short , not best review you've seen true , but game much more than just skating which great , ( i mention you switch characters tony himself bigfoot ?! )dila	1
well what i say this one da best tony hawk video games too date , i mean plot sick its right , you create ur own custom skater whoo goes bein street skater too national skateboardin icon , but this game switches its style plot first installment t.h.u.g. , this installment , your picked bye birdman himslef too lead your team world destruction tour which i think one da illest ideas , u gotta face up against no one other then skateboard bad boy himself " bam margera " who my personal opinion i big fan bam his possie ever since cky video days , now too them " main charachters " this game awsome , its like you got normal tony hawk skate team then whole " viva la bam " cast aswell , its just amazing , story mode best ive seen yet franchise , this game so addictingly fun , i recommend this game " 100% " . personally i think this title would fit it so much better " tony hawks underground 2 : world destuction tour . ps newest installment tony hawk franchise just dropped 3 days ago " tony hawks american wasteland " too tell you truth i think this game still little bit better , maybe its just because this game whole viva la bam cast it too give it crazy feel , but me this still undisputed champ thhe tony hawk franchise , now	1
i no longer play video games ( though i recently started back computergames ) but i review this great set . you get two games : fianl fantasy 5 , final fantasy 6 . first , let us look ff5 . ff5 never released states officialy but squaresoft ( now called squareenix ) unleashed it upon us all . it story isn't greatest but it not story here ; it all gameplay . this main reason this my favourite series . job class indepth gives you lot options here . this improves upon already great job class ff3 ( not ff6 ) only comes insecond job class system found dragon warrior 3 dragon warrior 7 . i also like size if this game , there three different worlds here they all good size . i also love main villian name , x-death , his final form name , neo x-death . there lot more good things make this game great but i'll let you discover them . ff6 also solid game introduced some things would found later ff games . one thing indepth stories multiple characters play . even though lot fans like say ff7 got best villian series , i many others dissagree . kefka jst pure evil incarnate . i'm not going into details so you yourself find all little things make him such awesome bad guy he . it just great game . if you don't mind 2-d graphics , old games , then yourself favoure get this fine set now	1
phew - i'm relieved able recommend this game . i've played them all - order . i really didn't enjoy last two , so i bit concerned . but her interactive got lot things right this one ! interesting mystery , puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into plot . not too much repetition tasks - hooray ! only reason it wasn't perfect , me , i really didn't learn too much . my favorite games ones where i walk away bit more knowledge something than i before going . this one - not so much . i also small objection ending . " treasure " , so speak , completely out park . there nothing indicate leading up it this what we seeking . , history buff , i hated seeing such " treasure " indeed relegated back-burner used throw-away very end	1
nba ballers phenom great game really fun play . what midway basically " advance " or fix original nba ballers who stared stephon marbary . midway made graphics better , gameplay better , litte more extra moves nice layout . layout looks cool way better then how it used look . reason why i give this game 4 star rather then 5 star loading game itself . ok i admit loading pretty long but its all worth it . what i mean game itself its more teens . i mean whole thing " ballers " i am not sure kids under 10 understand what it means how " bring it " game . original nba ballers i would say more kids , but since midway enhanced this game rather then change whole thing , i would say it blast teens 13+ . so what i am getting too if you under age 12 or 13 wait until 1 streetball comes out . but if your over 13 years age then then go out grab copy this game cause its blast ! -you	1
this game awsome !!!!! it way too graphic kids so parents no matter how much they beg don't buy it ! even story too adult them . it very interesting puzzle , action , adventure game . if you occational gamer set it easy dig because you get hang it little practice . puzzles require little brain power so ready vex sometimes	1
okay if you don't know this game rocks now i feel sorry you so i just want warn parents it violent so please if you problem don't buy it your kids otherwise why don't you already it	1
i bought " contact " based positive hype , without knowing much it all . i'm not disappointed . " contact " proven very enjoyable distraction me ever since it came ou t.t he premise game you helping boy called terry who moored deserted island wacky professor . you communicating professor via your ds guiding terry movements ( although he doesn't know you're there ) . terry mission help professor find his ship fuel cells while solving mysteries puzzles , fighting bad guys , gaining skills . this sense , game just like most rpgs , but i believe level gameplay more sophisticated than your typical final fantasy or zelda-type venture . many elements game borrowed those successful series , but they also combined puzzle game elements even " life simulation " elements such those harvest moon . terry recharges energy eating food he finds -- there many different sorts -- sleeping his bed , or taking warm bath . he fight enemies using weapons he picks up . he find interact items clues help him complete his quest go back home . one cutest features he acquire change into outfits enable him use skills like cooking . it not difficult get used intuitive game play , especially after brief read through instructions . you home equally using stylus or console buttons . what interesting me terry collect stick different decals produce various effects , you even peel decals off their backings , like real life , although using stylus . overall , this very interesting kind game , one makes full use ds unique capabilities such dual screens . if you're fan any genres mentioned above , you won't disappointed " contact .	1
this preview spoilers game please don read it if you didn play it ! i played xenogears when i saw xenosaga episode kinda short compare xenogears battle system but ok because xenosaga like " introduction " . ok improvements : gameplay longer than episode 1 ( i ended episode 1 everything 42 hours ) change ep2 ( 88+) . sidequest like plus if you want it it if you don you end game anyways . idea epiloge after you finish game very cool because you could kill special bosses get better kill final boss overkilled stuff like . chaos jr momo shion kosmos looking improved they looked more grow up . battle system put them up or down depending who you using or fighting well double tech attacksall characters able use all magic skills long you buy them your skillpoints making able sidequests . momo bow very nice improvement now she very good damage dealerrecover mp while stock good idea well use ep freely without any trouble . people complain because history focus jr urtvs but title says itself ( jenseits von gut und bse ) means " beyond good evil " wich means " rubedo worring ladies danger his red dragon mode wich makes him go out control ( possible reason sakura death ) , albedo his obssesive love rubedo but same time kill him well , nigredo wich refused mission ( involved rubedo ) killed his own father but he plays good person moment albedo said " giving life 1 hand delivering death other " . honestly second episode history role more development than first one because wasn introduction we starting know how things going ... what they wrong : i don see how they could think throw away tech attacks going good idea ... good thing they added tech attacks special attacks ep 3 you stock lot times make good combo characters(wich made battles kinda boring)music battle kinda boring compare ep 1voices chaos(sounded boring ... ) kos-mos ( like fake silly girl trying play robot ) shion ( pushing like " i better than you " ) momo ( very annoying ) sad thing my main team chaos kosmos momo thats why i got sad voice changes but they said they refix their voices episode 1 third last episode . ep 1 almost 8 hours movies ep 2 4:30 hours ( i guess complains long movies)i still don get it movies give more motion storyrole game wich most attractive things xenosaga over most games . episode 3 4hours full motion movies but plus speak texts faces included while characters move stuff like valkyrie profilethey cut completly close up when they cast spells or hit lights stuff most time you see characters back all way while you fighting . ( they fix ep3)in resume everyone know episode 2 bad things but well good things ( every game ) no they shouldn it bad when they noticed things people like game itself . good thing they fixed most bad stuff episode 2 episode 3 . battle system soundtrack characters voices all better only thing i didn like episode 3 battle mode they make it appear average rpg system ( attack , ether , tech , special tech , others ) so forget 4 combinations make tech attacks ethers cost " ep(cp ) " special attacks cost boosts . i wonder if attack give some " ep(cp ) " later . even all this i recommend you buy it before you get episode 3 because you losing lot storyline if you don more now they cost 20 dollars each ( or less)atte : roy_master	1
this game lacks questions , repeats them over over , 200 questions ? more like 40 , but regis hilarious ! but fastest finger way off , i no other complaints except lack questions ff round	1

i love fps genre . there just something running around blowing things away relieves day stress . said , if you're new cod games like i then there some adjustment . it not straight run gun kind game . one , varying degrees movement strategy required get your enemies without getting taken out . second , if you're used plasma gun 400 rounds then frequent reloading historical weapons take some getting used . but all this adds great interface , graphics , especially storyline this great game . i can't wait call duty 3	1
call duty 2 puts you role three different people - vasili , john davis , bill taylor - during three highly intense but different ww2 campaigns . you see war through each these soldiers eyes , so otherwords , its first person shooter . anyway , you get lot authentic ww2 weapons which include panzershreks , mp40s , m1 garands , thompsons , etc you get shoot blow up things like halftracks tiger tanks . ontop , you get smoke frag grenades toss around . there multiplayer which pretty fun - you pick team ( ie : british , nazis , americans .. you get it ) go toe toe friend or friends random places ww2 history . objectives each level sually require you either clear out houses room room , snipe out mortar teams , fend off massive german counterattack , or place bomb something . its pretty fun intense because you'll fighting off wave after wave nazis artillery while trying achieve your goal , but it becomes sorta repetitive during later levels .. i want stress word " intense " this game . you always your toes , always firing hordes enemies . this game isn't easy , even easy difficulty , ridiculously hard veteran difficulty . hardest my opinion american campaign during battle point du heuc ... if you think medal honor : frontline arnhem knights level difficult , wait till you see this . also , this game pretty long so don't try rushing it hah . moving , you'll fighting very detailed wartorn areas such egypt , france , russia , even germany . i impressed beautiful looking enviroments when up close , character models look amazing . however , levels feel kind linear . you pretty limited where you go , but i guess we look past tha t.t he sound effects great - i really loved explosions . voice acting great , actually helpful because your allies would like " kraut 2nd floor , black building " basically point out enemies you . what lowered this game 9 ? well starters its genre basically played death . ontop guns weren't very accurate nor some them seem very powerful . i felt ripped off when i shot guy bar he just sort kelled over , got up shot me again . meh . also , like i mentioned , objectives started get repetitive . ending kind rip off first - simple news reel explaining how allies won - but once credits roll , real ending begins . it shows bunch troops battling it out some destroyed city againt tanks , nazis , airplanes . it like watching movie . sum it all up , if you got x-box 360 then you need play this game . it isn't best my opinion , but it sure lot fun . go buy it	1
it pretty fun game few quirks here there . some them include anoying " click button " interface , few problems just random guess solve . other than , it very good graphics very addictive storyline	1
i am big fan rpgs this one my favorite one yet . it great story line it not impossible beat	1
this probably one my least favorite ff games psone . there some good things some bad things this game . first bad : 1 . squaresoft ( now square enix , goddammit ! ) trying get old roots snes games . me anyway , it doesn't look entirely like those games . 2 . some characters worst ff games ' history ( quina , eiko , garnet . i am not sexist , it just their abilities suck their type combat terrible ) . other characters good , not great , but decent . 3 . i don't care too much character models ( deformation final fantasy 8 graphics mix ) . okay good parts game : 1 . cinemas !!! they look really good psone game , most games cinemas psone don't look great this era gaming even some during era . 2 . ending !! i am not saying anymore . 3 . battle system . it not quite ff8 not quite ff7 but it trance system thingy . after this game , i sadly am seeing series not good it once ( i like final fantasy crystal chronicals can't wait remake ff3 ds ) , final fantasy 10 isn't legendary , ff 11 , which i never never play ( because fees , reminds me too much like phantasy star online ( i like game though ) , not much single player expericence no storyline ) , ff 12 just because it ff11 battle engine , looks like ffcc ff10 mixed together , i just seem not care much newer ff games anymore . so i would recommend any ff game psone ( including psone ports snes games origins ) because they so great even if games don't best graphics world , it gameplay storylines count	1
i three these logitech wireless controllers now . they all broken nearly seven months day i buy them . problem same every time , left analog stick breaks . my girlfriend got me my first one december 2004 ( christmas ) . it lasted until july 2005 . i exchanged it store , new one lasted until maybe february 2006 . i exchanged it again now my third one just bit dust september 2006 . i am not really heavy gamer . i play madden ncaa 2007 sparingly . i am very disappointed this repeat problem . i also notice " " button sticking issue others refer here . i tried putting little graphite there make it not stick . seemed work while . you really can't beat convenience wireless , every other aspect controller great except durability .	1
this game run my $%*#@ computer very well . scenarios story very god ! price very chepest , delivery very speedy	1
since heady days arcade favorites such asteroids , pac-man , missile command , people claimed video games help sharpen your reflexes keep you thinking fast . but there never seemed any hard science back it up . over 20 years later , nintendo releasing product nintendo ds squarely aimed hard science , making claim playing brain age : train your brain minutes day " make your brain feel fresh sharp . " well , we're not scientists , so we can't necessarily prove or disprove claim , but budget-priced game , brain age strangely compelling , even though its very nature brutally repetitivethe touch screen ds microphone make whole game possible . it really slick way play game , but it also reliant your handwriting ability speak clearly . when you're rushing through math problems , it easy squiggle down something game misinterpret . this extremely frustrating , you're penalized mistakes . voice recognition doesn't come into play very often , you bypass it entirely if you like , but we trouble getting it recognize certain words . over time , you figure out exactly how game wants you write speak then adapt it . most part , though , recognition pretty impressive , especially considering there no calibration process involved . overall : this game isnt really one those games you look foward when you get home whatever you , it one those games you look foward bring something , thats why it usfull game made portabal system . great game roadtrip	1
i am glad see some favorable reviews below . i thought i only one thought this game rocked . i pretty shocked read very mediocre reviews form " experts " like gamespot which gave this game 5.5 most " experts " seem base their opinions mostly control scheme . i admit first it bit unwieldy , because instead using control pad or ' joystick ' aim gun/reticle , you use remote point . such it seem bit too sensitive , but once you play while you get very used it . least i , it felt almost second nature me . sword fighting bit janky but still good , your motions doesn't necessarily translate what happens screen . i thought whole storyline scenarios very clever ( one stage even you trying escape amusement park while hunted ) . graphics i thought very good . some harbor scenes , shimmering waves amazing , little attention details such scratches elevator doors , nice touch . i admit bit disappointed graphics this game aren't like ones you see official trailers red steel . but way some reviewers talking graphics you'd think they reviewing playstation one game . one only get excited know graphics get even better . bottom line out five launch games i got , red steel one i keep coming back most , because me it fun . i don't care what reviewers think , that way i feel	1
just thought i'd share my my opinion . i think id2 great game very deep lore , great graphics , replayability more . if your into rpg games this right up your alley	1
honest i lost confident squresoft after playing ffviii , they pick up little ffix . then they mess rpg formula ffx -ffxi ffx-2 . wherever they called those rpg games . now they star fresh ffxii very good game . i just remenber when i played my first ' rpg game ffii then ffiii snes not mention clasic like chrono trigger , secre mana ff-tactic ffvii ogre tactic . mhont . this game rpg root music clasic ffii some fftactic . graphi fantastic . new engine little pro con . since they place where you need turn off gamblic icom finish sequense- continous game . very cleaver . but good . hope now squre-enix keep up good work keeping francise fresh this one . exellent game recommended any harcore rpg player . 10 out 10 .	1
ok-i not review any other comments this game before posting this . i playing final fantasy games very long time ... i still ( play :p ) mystic quest , final fantasy ii ff iii snes . ff xii best final fantasy since #3 ( us ) , my opinion ... it fun !!!! story line awesome ( kinda like shakespeare meets king arthur ) it reminds me bit final fantasy 3 ... only awesome graphics ! my one peeve all games leveling up ( hp mp . ) i felt like after i mastered " new " way doing i t-t hey changed it next game !!! old games it automatically ... after those , you equip things order gain strength , magic , special abilities . this game combines what you already learned ff vii ... if you never played game , there great tutorial you access any time . this game just plain fun ... i think most fun since ff iii . you freedom explore wander without getting lost ( there reminder bottom map x show you where go ) , you see whatever you come into contcact ( friends foes ) , storyline gameplay phenomenal	1
movie tie-ins usually rather tiresome affair . they sell bundles units more often than not large pile mediocrity . godfather game different . obviously it made back unparalleled success francis ford coppolla gangster masterpiece . it sell this reason well . however , godfather game it own place epic narrative . it would easy ea put player shoes michael corleone - main protagonist movies . indeed , it may due failure securing license use al pacino voice likeness forced ea hand creating fresh perspective famous storyline . what we're left new take featuring your good self ; narrative sees you seamlessly weave out events loyal film . example , when luca brasi stabbed through hand garrotted - start first movie - you look event through window , you're spotted scene turns into revenge mission . it expertly executed you feel part story genuine loyal film . violence superbly recreated also . realistic nature firearms godfather makes interesting gameplay . you might used rather `cartoonish ' gunplay saint row gta , godfather might first seem unforgiving . it . but it realistic - take one bullet close range you're sleeping fishes ... it simple . conversely your own guns carry same clout , so shootouts often become intense challenging affairs , if little frustrating . where gta gun fighting success dependent how quickly you change targets get your shots off , godfather sees you picking your shots timing runs cover . it obvious ea development focussed heavily walking shooting parts game , this where most appeal lies . driving however different affair altogether . given nature godfather ea limited what isn't possible driving sections . physics cars mean they frustrating play . most vehicles slow faster cars seem unnaturally quick . handbrake turns work so well gta irritatingly difficult pull off , especially when chased coppers . cars bounce off kerbs but smash right through lampposts practically unaffected . other vehicles , however , seemingly made concrete . also , getting one way point times tedious - gta gets round this superbly scripted radio stations , but godfather doesn't such ingenuity - you're instead treated violin-based soundtrack depressing once novelty runner . valid excuse most this isn't ea fault - this more or less what it like drive car ' them days ' . there no radio ; cars lame , classic , but moved like pair concrete boots . where violence so real , so must rest game if only consistency . you would expect much what you directed storyline . however there provisions those who more impulsive . outside missions there businesses extort rackets take over . doing such build your weekly wage , which you then turn spend clobber sorting your hair out . you respect bar increases each completed mission , but coolly this isn't only way gain kudos amongst fellow gangsters . buying nice wise guy suit brings plaudits boosts respect meter much whacking guy . each time your character levels up you get point allocate his attributes . it bit weak rpg element , but worth thinking when acquiring garments . extorting businesses tricky , but worth effort . you'll usually take out two or three ' bad guys ' before able get owner . when you situation requires thought . essentially you need scare businessman into paying , you so finding his or her ' limit ' . so while some owners agree ' protection ' soon you ask , others battered brink death . pretty sick , but then life gangster isn't fairies . warned though , going over top or killing proprietor render business inactive while you'll get nothing but bruised set knuckles . it fantastic sidetrack main game taken seriously if you want hire muscle buy more powerful weapons later missions . so you've got two sections same game sit paradoxically each other . superbly well balanced combat game play forces you thoughtful timely . very dodgy vehicle part frustrates bores more than anything else . it difficult review sandbox game without making comparison gta , although it slightly unfair so godfather given rules imposed subject matter . it very best it delivers gritty realism , but same realistic token , it times terribly dull . it difficult dislike godfather ea so faithful everything we loved films - but this undoing game also . it would forgivable exaggerate gameplay places order make it more entertaining . but godfather game purists order please it feel genuine , godfather certainly .	1
i like gta series games this one great too . i turn up my settings max ( my computer over year old ) there no problems . kid reviewer claims he doesn't like " n/f bomb " . why this rated mature ( so he should not even playing it ) . give series taste some things cannot eliminated . this fun games just exploring city or completing missions	1
it very confusing i find some hints playing game , too much going back forth hunting things if you miss something you sometimes can't go back get it . overall i like it because it not overly difficult so far .. i hate games so difficult only experienced gamers play	1
when i started playing this game it hard me stop i play it every chance i get best thing it i got it far less money amazon.com	1
if you ds owner , this game must-have . you not disappointed	1
this game must-own if you ds . it total eight cups four races each ( 16 all new , 16 retro ) . go through different difficulties unlock new racers karts ( mirror mode where you game backwards ) . also first wifi gaming , playing online awesome ! short , buy this game	1
my just turned 6 year old figure out 70% logic needed this game , he can't very few tasks like fly dragon win hero time there one stone monster boss guy i finally defeat him . but , he really likes this game , he " gets " goals figure out some hunting trial error how get thru chapters . it tad more " killing " stuff than i care but what doesn't these days . he likes able different characters , his favorite puss boots ! grown up i enjoyed it well , especially humor	1
incredibles movie pleasant suprise , featuring lifelike characters , well animated fight scenes , interesting story . game follows closely movie , few additional easter eggs . first , good : incredibles game fun gameplay , good overall graphics , multiple cut scenes , nice ammount replayability . only problems game , first , game very short . there aren't many levels , they aren't very long . good player beat entire game less than day , but it probably take new player around week . most length caused some hard sections , such first two omnidroid battles places where game makers didn't make it easy grab rope or something . game heavily scripted , making it easy predict what you face next . final problem you barely spend any time playing dash or voilet . dash two levels , voilet only one . game very fun bonus feature you unlock halfway through game , called battle . battle , you choose either mr. or mrs. incredible , battle seemingly endless waves enemies . all all , incredibles short , fun game worth rental , but you should think it before you buy i t.t hanks reading , bubba " samus "	1
what better than game made adults or kids ? sly , sneaky humor only adults understand greatest toy ever created legos ! all theme best star wars movies !! many games put ' replayability ' allowing you go through game or missions second or third time different character , but lego star wars this fashion totally fun . it not simple regurgitation map different character ( wihoo replayable ... ) but rather ingenious method rewards you additional pieces building well secret areas previously unobtainable . instance , you might need stormtrooper ( or uniform ) , jedi ( dark or light ) , or even bounty hunter enter specific areas . droids often used access areas well , but you usually them during missions . using ' free play ' mode , you go back through missions character you created , or any other character you unlocked . during mission , you cycle through your characters use their abilities . this allows you go back unlock new areas find additional bricks etc . fact there new abilities characters you find later well new areas explore really makes replayability fun worthwhile . aspect this game i absolutely love cooperative play . this great adults able play kids , or even spouses . my wife doesn't play lot xbox titles , but she loves playing this game we blast going through missions together . i'm surprised more games don't actually give you coop play like this . seems it enough toss death match label game ' multiplayer ' . my only complaint camera , both single cooperative mode . often times camera shift based one players force other player back towards center screen . more than one occasion , this caused death characters or when we get stuck forces one players swap characters midstream . sometimes this isn't obvious player . it would really nice option split screen , especially real estate hdtv provides . all all , i would highly recommend this game . especially if you kids want spend some quality time them . great game	1
though i daunted little reviews stating problem installing game i went it i don't regret . i bought platinum edition it installs all right . good thing platinum edition you get three games same time . would not say it one very bests available its category but it interesting fun . graphics , though details not great , still i liked 3-d view , specially view through eyes main character(hero ) . story so so . dialogs specially bad . but fact you follow certain clues talk people find out useful information good idea . sort combination rpg rts . i like units way they fight . also picking up artifacts or weapons good . overall it nice game . platinum edition specially good you get lots hours gameplay	1
essentially , this platinum edition dvd three games bargain-bin price . i couldn't pass it up . i little trouble getting it launch first , but after little internet session , i back world rpg/rts hybrid excellence . seamless integration two elements makes truly unique experience . unlike other rts games , there many adventure elements , you aren't just plunked down each map ; you fight your way map map . unlike other rpg games , your hero won't able go it alone ; defeat foes lay their path , he/she call upon power armies six different races : human , elves , dwarves , orcs , trolls , dark elves . your avatar must find structures known rune monuments access his/her unique power using runes summon forth rune heroes armies . rpg element game limited essentially character you create beginning . your avatar , rune warrior , remnant powerful heroes served circle mages during time convocation . avatar completely under your control ; you choose name , equipment , gender , distribute skill points stat points they gain levels create unique character . you create punishing melee fighter , powerful sorcerer , deadeye archer , or any combination those other concepts . your avatar also summon rune heroes he/she goes ; these heroes other rune warriors whose levels classes fixed , so all you equip them best available items . you progress through game , you find more powerful hero runes summon better heroes hero monuments . rts element continuation system started warcraft , but few twists . you must find rune monument one six races ( human monument , dwarf monument , etc . ) , possess appropriate worker rune , building plans , unit plans summon army . once you summon your workers , they gather resources build necessary structures summon army . need appropriate building unit plans occasionally necessitates fully exploring each map , so not miss any . levels your military units depends level worker rune you used summon your workers , so you find higher-level worker runes your units gain levels become stronger . heart winter shadow phoenix help add dozens hours original order dawn campaign , granting you access higher levels , more powerful equipment , new heroes , more advanced units . one my favorites " walking fortress " troll unit hurls massive boulders enemy structures . you import your avatar order dawn into both expansions , allowing this hero complete epic adventure . shadow phoenix very challenging some most ridiculous boss fights i ever seen . several them require your avatar , rune heroes , full army bring down single foe . heart winter excellent continuation order dawn , adding new friends enemies , shadow phoenix harrowing challenging test strategy patience your rune hero moves towards their ultimate destiny . sum it up , this dvd plenty adventurous rts/rpg action wrapped around engrossing fantasy yarn should provide dozens hours quality entertainment . highly recommended .	1
nintendo ds lite ( 2006 . ) introduction : late 2004 , nintendo premiered nintendo dual screen , or nintendo ds short . despite skepticism many critics fans alike , new console quickly won audiences over . it nintendo best handheld console date . 2006 , nintendo released smaller , lighter version system , appropriately called ds lite . overview : nintendo released ds lite mid 2006 . new version system smaller than old version , features repositioned buttons/switches/etc , variable brightness levels , few other changes classic ds . it retails $130.00 comes three colors - white , black , pink . review : nintendo good job revising ds . many problems older version system fixed . here some highlights flaws new version . -the good- -smaller more compact than original ds . original ds rather bulky comparison some other handhelds market , it kind pain haul around . finally , we've got smaller , lighter version system easily transported . -variable brightness levels . you adjust brightness your liking this version ds . brighter levels use more battery power , lower levels use less , so you plan out how best use your battery life . -features clip game boy advance slot . unlike original ds , lite version includes clip goes slot where game boy advance games fit . this helps give system streamlined appearance , it keeps slot cleaner . -compatible e-reader . old ds , due its shape , couldn't use e-reader accessory . lite model shape better all around , it use it ! -available three cool colors . whether you want white , black , or pink , there color everyone . -repositioned buttons things . nintendo made system more convenient use moving buttons around spots easier use . -redesigned stylus . new stylus bigger thicker than ones old ds , all-around improvement . -compatible older ds . since it basically same system , you won't any compatibility issues . -the bad- -smaller isn't necessarily better every way . i big hands they fit old ds fine . shrinking it actually makes it little harder , some aspects , use all buttons . -still not compatible pre-game boy advance games . course i wasn't really expecting nintendo fix this . -still not compatible game boy advance multiplayer . thing i wasn't expecting fixed . overall : overall this nice improvement over original ds . there problems , but most part , just same problems original . if you haven't gotten ds yet , definitely go lite model . edition notes : ds lite relatively new should stores years come .	1
okay game -- very fun , different powers easy use i like morrowind-esque game mechanics . this feels like smaller , scaled down version morrowind honest . graphics nice engine not hog , you run them fairly high res even clunker i'm playing . so what problem ? freezes ! i reckon it happens every twenty minutes while playing . without able save when you're quest ... it becomes annoying . i don't any sound card issues , any fancy visual themes running ( like windows blinds ) ... bottomline these freezes should not happening yet they . this should already solved now , but there no patches or updates game . arrogant game designers presume they would not encounter any problems they would patch post-release . there not even option menu game search updates ! freezes cripple playability game , so overall it not worth paying playing my opinion	1
this game masterpiece dragonball name . graphics nice , certain fighting sequences show some really detailed animation looks like they took it show itself ( they didn't really ) . you option just playing fusion characters doing fusion you don't any time limit all or you just select character itself . this goes transformations well , giant ape characters , super sayian levels ( not 4 they put goku vegeta ss4 seperate characters ) some bad parts first game don't exist this game . some characters didn't best moves list first game , like ss4 goku which he full power energy balls , super explosive wave , his ultimate 10x kamehameha wave . it also nice put some lesser known characters dragon ball universe game well ( garlic jr , turles , slug , jenemba first form , pikkon , pan , ubb etc . ) . however not every single character this game , which makes it look horrible when you play story mode . following characters not this game : gt goku ( little ) his super sayian formsdr . wheelo ( worlds strongest)gt trunks ssgt goten ssgt gohan ssgt vegeta his ss formsbio broly ( maybe we're better off not him this because i'm sure he wasn't very popular anyway)the 6 other dragonsgeneral rildo ( early part baby saga when gang m2)goku jrvegeta jrthis game half tenkaichi 1/3 each budokai games : 1 . dragon universe back but much better2 . some things exclusive game . ( first budokai , cell accidently swallows krillin instead 18 made little story ) every sayian character who armor tail ( like raditz instance ) transorm into giant ape . 3 . like budokai 2 when you first started dragon world , you selection goku , adult gohan so forth . adventure mode this game , some later chapters , they used ultimate gohan gt gohan trunks sword make it look like your playing gt trunks . this one cheesist things ever any game . this most impressive game series last dragonball game appear ps2 we heading toward next generation consoles . wii version coming out too .	1
i'm 40-something guy can't recall how many multi-hour sessions spent playing this game ! simply lots fun i enjoy thoroughly story line . flood ... freak me out	1

nintendo aware manufacturer defect occurs ds lite regular ds game systems come colors ( not silver one ) . plastic hinge closest power supply develops stress crack happens simple everyday use . nintendo refuses accept these cracks defects tries attribute them rough play . we owned 3 ds lites all 3 developed same stress crack , same spot , all within 2-3 months owning them . first one cracked enough render unit unplayable . same happened friends ours . while kids kids , my kids certainly aren't playing touch football their dss . there dozens websited dedicated this problem ( just takes little googling ) , some attribute it overtightening during manufacturing . nintendo not cover this repair under warranty but nice enough reduce $75 repair fee $50 . so when choosing nintendo ds lite , ask yourself if you want brighter screen or sturdier unit . my 7 year old son who his 2nd ds lite just asked if he could original one christmas	1
time , white only option . red would pleased my child more . i've found sp games which claim work wireless attachement , not work ( communicate ) ds games . but ds lite , its reasonable size , perhaps slightly larger buttons would nicer . now they offer pink black , which nice , but exchangable covers would nice . stylus just barely managable adult hands but work fine my child . screens bright no longer dimmable ( backlighting could turned off sp . one nice feature many games allow some amout co-play ds , even if your partner doesn't copy . stores like " gamestop " often kiosks allow you download demos different games . thats nice but you cannot keep demo thru power cycle , so that bummer . biggest pain yet i not found cable communicate ds lite sp ( one exist ds sp ) . oh , power supply cable different well . so , while less bulky better layout , ds lite steps you even further away accessories which worked sp ds ( first versions , not lite ) . such proprietary way . i'd really like see more adult software these things . they not far pda their audio recognition handwriting well	1
i liked this game . i mean final fantasy vii still god final fantasy game but this ok . i mean it also comes chrono trigger . if you played chrono cross got confused means you never played trigger .	1
one thing kotor 2 greatly impressed me how obsidian , taking kotor franchise over bioware , not mess winning formula . they faithfully carried over first game visual style , presentation , atmosphere , which means those who played kotor 1 jump right . just like kotor 1 , game hinges its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features . kotor 2 storyline runs parallel kotor 1 , introduces new protagonist whose only tie first game he/she fought mandalorian wars . again , characters bit flat/stereotypical , most talking throughout game ( you mostly choose how you'll respond others through your dialogue choices ) . main reason why i would actually rate this game higher - yes , higher - than kotor 1 intelligence script . what i mean how game characters challenge you ( both main character person playing game ) think long hard some things regarded " truths . " yes , i'm talking some serious philosophy here . example , kreia , one your allies , challenges you think how random act kindness actually robs person that helped chance struggle , fight , become stronger it . jedi master challenge you think what if cause you believed strongly ends up doing just much harm it prevents . instance game shows dangers both blind allegiance independent thought ( yes , latter also dangers ) . best part all this presented within context game various scenarios , without ever sounding preachy . far gameplay mechanics concerned , obsidian spiced up battle interface new force powers feats , which open up new dimension strategizing outfitting your party . unfortunately it seems all bugs glitches first game carried over well , such " doorway bug " " menu bug . " playing pazaak still just hard . nod those who played first game , obsidian decided insert many references kotor 1 here there . example , kotor 2 recycles two planets first game , dantooine korriban . maps identical ones first game , but this time you explore slightly different parts planets . people game constantly referring mandalorian wars ( war fought five years before kotor 1 timeline ) jedi civil war ( events kotor 1 ) . fact , you'll find jedi civil war casts very large shadow over lives many people you'll encounter game , including most your allies . you'll find played first game certainly enriches this one , although it not crucial . so , summary , if you're suffering post-kotor withdrawal symptoms , your prayer answered - go buy this game now	1

when i played kurt warner arena football first time i dissapointed because first i thought it going like real arena football game like madden or gameday but my suprise it like blitz nfl extreme so if you want buy real football game buy madden 2001	1
good-it fairly good graphics-the franchise very real you play it up 30 seasons . -it bunch new features madden 05 didn't like , truck stick nfl superstarthe bad-once you've played this awhile you'll realize john madden al micheals say same thing every game . it get old . -when you look into crowd game , graphics suck . it looks like big blob colors overall it really fun game . i hope madden 07 better though .	1
anyone who ever played original would know whole point kingdom hearts beat stuffing out heartless nifty weapons known keyblades , well , this time around you get beat stuffing out heartless new brand villan known nobody . compelling story line great voice acting , donald goofy act sound just like their dsney versions , kingdom hearts 2 delivers every aspect gameplay except one , summons . i love this game , don't get me wrong , but i felt they really could added couple more summons into mix make battle system much more fun , original roughly 7 summons all together this one only 4 . square , how adding couple final fantasy summons , into gameplay ? * cough , cough * behemut ! either way this great game , one any final fantasy or disney fan should pick up	1
i play adventure games regular basis i really enjoyed this game following reasons : 1 ) storyline well put together made sense2 ) scenery quite breathtaking3 ) puzzles range quite easy extremely difficult , but there always chance get hints or ( if you spent way too much time puzzle its time move ) you get solution4 ) main character interacted others regular basis . i'm so tired never encountering person adventure games ! 5 ) i initially thought characters going quite shallow predictable , but things change ! great job this one !! it certainly one my all-time favorites	1
i wasn't sure if i wanted purchase this game because it got so many bad reviews ( magazines , amazon reviewers , g4tv ) . however , because i love puss boots because recent price drop , i decided give it go . well , it not like final fantasy ( many compared it ) . it more like gauntlet : dark legacy . graphics really good . address criticism , game not cheap movie novelty created left over scraps . my only complaint you can't choose characters you want each level ; they choosen you . however , you switch 4 characters given most them cool . fun factor =3 . 5replayability = 3graphics = 4.5 controls = 5camera angles =3 . 5mostly young teens under enjoy this game . even if you dont like shrek , this game appeal grims fairy tale fans ( like me ) . i got mine " new " ebgames only 9.99 hurry , before they gone !	1

first off , this game very addicting so much fun . prince persia : two thrones really takes you back what so great sands time . one thing i really found enjoyable this game story . you really find yourself attached certain characters it brings you into game . great thing this game gameplay , which again brings player back greatness sands time . one thing i fing great all action encountered throughout game . ability sword slash through enemies gives this game nice balance . without this , game would purely platform while this could fun , it definetely needs action keep it feeling alive . ability use quick kills also very entertaining . bosses game also fantastic . each them very different way you fight them which something i found help keep game fresh . some very platform feeling way you fight , others much more action quick kill like . cool addition two thrones dark prince . although times he seems bit overpowered , addition him well needed made game very fun . overall , i thought this game brought back feel sands time although it still lacks slightly gameplay than first , it still great definetley better than warrior within . presentationthe story great keeps player attached this game . it truly back its roots people who liked sands time going love this game . graphicsthe graphics this game very nice environments fantastic . soundthe voice acting this game fantastic ! music also great definitely creates nice mood game . gameplaythe gameplay great ! i love quick kills they truly add new demention game . lasting appealthe game feels bit short , beat 7-10 hours . although there unlockables , there isn't much incentive play through game all way through second time	1

i bought this game over four years ago just say i must replayed this game least dozen times ( start-finish ) . this game one major reasons i bought xbox then xbox 360 . if you like play shooters this game you . graphics even today standards very good . campaign best thought out story i ever seen even better than movies . only thing this game lacks online play but this game released just before xbox live came out . if you want play online get pc version or buy halo 2 . once you beat this game get halo 2 it also extremely good game . halo 3 sale xbox 360 year hopefully less	1
computer games bad reputation : they're violent , mindless , escapist , blah , blah , blah . mostly , reputation well-deserved ; computer games entertainment , , such , they're designed take our minds off " real " world while . what wrong ? simcity 4 not typical computer game . you need no coordination all , you don't need accept any fantasy world , there no one shoot ( or anything shoot , either ) , there no mazes run , so . what there ability see " real " world , but way you want it , rather than it . one form or , simcity around many years . this version part its continual evolution . i've owned two earlier versions , i found this one best yet terms features operation . it works way its supposed . side benefit simcity its long history allowed huge on-line community develop . there hundreds sites offering chat , help issues , templates cities , etc . you certainly don't need these sites make full use game out box , but they there . one most interesting things simcity way it demonstrates education entertainment aren't mutually exclusive . you play , you forced come terms issues like relationship tax rates business growth ; parks , citizen satisfaction , public works budgets ; pollution economic development ; etc . however , none these lessons explicit ; they just dawn you you play , because you see consequences your decisions . i heard very young kids understand appreciate these issues after short time playing . i tend measure entertainment value terms fun per unit money . regard , simcity 4 outstanding entertainment value . i've liked past iterations game , i like this one even better , i'll almost certainly buy next version , too	1
terms overall quality , this game light-years better than tekken 4 . graphics terrific , gameplay improved dramatically , they got rid annoying position change feature . i especially love customization feature . my only problem playing against jinpachi , who usually takes me 15 tries before getting lucky shot beat him . other than , this game terrific	1

i read other reveiws , everybody here thinks this cheating program like gameshark . but if you knew true understand wasn't idiot who doesn't understand what pc stands ! action replay lets you modify games replay them your xbox which now come know " soft modding " ! downloading special program just made this xbox you able harness power modifying saves even then create weapons , maps , games into your xbox ! which come very handy halo me since i now create maps into what i want allowing veihcles into maps where they cant ! this not hundered percent chance it working though if you many games saved xbox since its large file when downloaded ! more information just type soft modding ton sites come up	1
there seems schools thought this one . some hard core fans old versions ( which i never played ) extremely upset mini-games changed ( especially monkey target ) . other reviewers absolutely love game what it ... challenging experience destined provide you hours upon hours enjoyment ! lets start main game . i love how wiimote used here . it incredibly sensitive works perfectly this type game . when you play through first word ( eight levels boss ) you taken credits . when this happened first time i nearly freaked out began wonder who sell game someone not too big loss . however , once credits over i realized you would multiple worlds choose . i'm now midway through world six they just get better better . there point when i ready tear my hair out it so challenging . but , once you beat level , you psyched up ready challenge . this sign great game . this game worth buying one player mode alone . this other part game now " infamous " multi-player mode . there 50 games here ... fifty !!!!! i agree other reviewers who say not all , maybe even most , " party games " now very well . controls obviously not perfected i " ll probably never play many them again . however , there some mini-games wonderful ! my wife never plays video games loves these minis . some very addicting . my wife younger brother spent day me today we blast playing minigames alone over three hours didn't even come close playing them all . yeah , some letdowns , but most lot fun . best thing mini-games they so varied . they really show what new wii controls capable . conclusion , not buy this game if you only want play monkey target . but , if you looking super fun launch title played played both single multi-player form , buy it now ! you easily get your money worth its replay value high . monkey ball rules	1
if somebody came up you said , " here , some super powers " what would you ? well , incredible hulk ultimate destruction basically allows you take super powers , run rampant them just any way you want . while it doesn't contain level violence or crime grand theft auto , ( lets face it , that what everyone comparing this game ) it doesn't need . it also not contain depth story gta so good . but lets face it , when you elbow drop onto someone head 50 stories up , you sacrifice some things . when you hurl tank into helicopter watch them both explode almost able feel impact explosion , everything else just kind fades into background anyway . i just beat game few days ago , i don't even remember first few story missions , because i spent so much time just running through city , smashing things jumping skyscraper skyscraper , thoroughly enjoying every second it . you lose yourself this game play hours without realizing it just like you gta , but instead getting frustrated game , you actually feel sense relief each time you pound one your opponents mercilessly into ground repeatedly stomp thier heads , let out growl , kick them across street . anger management never felt so good ..	1
5 stars very low number compared how good this game . light jak freakin awesome , after awhile u really get attached this game course charchters themselves . must buy anyone looking non-stop action game	1

there no denying star wars battlefront one best video game series currently available . first game really amazing , let us participate some places seen all six movies . but , even though game really fun , it felt like there something still missing . missing piece put this result . this not disappoinment , but best ! unlike first game when main story gameplay just caputring bases killing all enemy forces , here , there actually missions complete . retrieve data-discs , killing rebel leaders , this game more indepth than it predecessor . game , there still times when bases captured , like first game , but you no longer kill all enemies . coolest part game you get ride different ships other things movies . lots fun !! so , overall , this game really improvement over first but some may prefer first more . reason first game basically kill everyone take their bases , less seen here focus more protecting things stealing things .	1
this game really good . theres wide varity lvls play , very good multyplayer system . game only few faults , like blown up frigate space sometimes goes through capital ship . game also gets little boring after while . besides , its great game	1
i got this x-mas i am huge spyro fan ! i started second one this now fifth release not counting gameboy games , second playstation 2 . last one , enter dragonfly wasn't so successful i feared there wouldn't ; but here it ! so many things added . buying items item shops , keychains keys open boxes , riding around professors new gadget ball , mini-games featuring not spyro , but his friends , etc . i kind miss flying spyro through rings speed race , but ... this new spyro clearly trying keep up newer platform games others seem enjoy , but luckily they kept things too hard you give up eventually you don't worry wandering around getting lost game . spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole , etc . he moves , he even meets little dragons like him- ember , flame . hard enough keep you playing get through challenge , but it never seems overwhelming . some mini-game second levels pain , but you come back later . strategy guide also helpful . this time , i don't think anyone complain spyro hasn't evolved or it same old thing , but spyro fans love spyro even if it same game but new adventures levels . he spyro ! hours enjoyment	1
several years , several sequels , passed now , so gta iii really worth time ? i'd definitely say so . this game continues incredibly fun years later . you pick it up just play or you advance through stories . each engaging creative , just like sequels . when it comes down it , this great game it still holds its weight against sequels knock off games . it definite buy	1

final fantasy series that almost familiar casual hardcore gamers mario zelda , yet franchise incomplete america 16 years . well , case until november 15th rolled around nintendo ds owners treated first-ever american version final fantasy iii . originally 1990 nes game long since mystery those who didn't illegally download roms or import game , final fantasy iii great game aged quite well makes great appearance nintendo ds . story pretty bare 2006 standards , but thinking classic style game , it quite above other games its time . story revolves around luneth , boy dark world who forms team three other individuals destined warriors light . these warriors prophesied save world darkness protect four precious , powerful crystals maintain balance peace . luneth co . ( arc , refia , ingus ) set out set everything world straight . today we sit think , " how generic . " back then , though , it popular idea playing rhythm-based game guitar controller . let get one thing straight ; this game dated lot ways . if you've played playstation or game boy advance remakes final fantasy i ii , you've got idea how pacing , battle system , overall flow classic rpg goes . it much different than squareenix other recent rpg same franchise , final fantasy xii ; which feels completely different without considering its gameplay battle system alterations . final fantasy iii isn't easy game . it doesn't really hold your hand any point , it'll ruthlessly punish those unfortunate gamers who tread off suggested path . still , it got classic hook , hook that almost impossible describe but even harder avoid once it snagged you . final fantasy iii keeps four-person party standard its two original predecessors also traditional turn-based battle system . result system forces you really think your actions each turn because enemy going attack no matter what their agility or speed parameters . if refia running low hp you suspect possible group attack boss character , it would wise cast healing spell maybe even prepare phoenix down . it would nice see squareenix adapt active time battle system final fantasy vi , vii , so , but what here works well anyway . mp system quite dated , instead set amount , each level magic its own number points . using level one black magic spell like fire take one point away your level one magic points , while level three one like fira takes away one level three magic point . no matter what spell you use , it takes away single point . i don't like this system much , because it doesn't give much importance or power each spell . example , level three white magic spells cura teleport given same point value , which doesn't make sense when cura used least fifty times often teleport throughout game . this seems good place mention menu system , which also quite dated sometimes not easy use newer entries . because dated mp system , there numbers all over place it seems little sloppy . new story here job system . surely if you've gaming internet page or read gaming magazine last few months , you've seen final fantasy iii ads state it offers 279,841 unique party combinations , four characters 23 different jobs . if you don't believe it , grab your nearest graphing calculator figure up equation factorials . beginning , every character possesses neutral ( undeveloped ) freelancer job . you find interact more powerful crystals throughout storyline , you'll unlock more jobs develop your party even further . you warrior , thief , monk , black , red , or white mage early game eventually you'll unlock jobs like geomancer , dark knight , dragoon , summoner ninja . once you choose job , you power it up increasing its job level ; value unique each job each individual character . example , it possible luneth level 15 freelancer , level 25 warrior , level 30 dark knight before end game . these levels , course , separate character base level , which , always , increases experience points earned random battles boosts your general stats . more than anything , final fantasy iii good way introduce foreign chapter series long-term players series veterans . i wasn't surprised when , after 30-minute trek through cave , i killed two turns boss character forced tread long path all over again . it unfortunate so much backtracking required , but even after dying second time same boss using same annoying attack , i picked game back up . i trudged through it despite my bitterness enjoyed every second it . classic rpgs like final fantasy iii didn't introduce save points or crystals found later games ; only save point overworld map . here , game saved any point . big challenge comes when status-changing magic wreaks havoc your party . unlike recent rpgs , where negative status often eliminated after battle , almost every single status ailment final fantasy iii remains afterward . poison , paralysis , confusion , frog-all these familiar effects lot more familiar time players see ending credits . unseasoned rpg players probably quite frustrated , know every time you see enemy use attack " bad breath , " you're quite lot trouble . final fantasy iii one best-looking ds games date . squareenix introduced visual style that reminiscent final fantasy vii final fantasy : crystal chronicles . result game very colorful detailed . spell effects impressive one could expect ds trump those some console games . boss monster models fun look defeat . i would liked see some more animation during battle ; rather than running up attacking enemies , like final fantasy , characters stand place swing their weapons classic rpg style . it would really nice see squareenix go those extra two miles ( they already went one reworking graphics ) but what here great . music seems standard rpg fare , i'm not totally sure whether or not tunes high-quality rips classic nes midi , but what here sounds pretty nice . least there unforgettable nine-note victory tune ; that'll always get smile out final fantasy fan . final fantasy iii serves its purpose introducing unknown chapter fans doing so very respectable fashion . there things could better , sure . squareenix could put little more time modernizing battle system , animation , menus , save system . would put two cherries top sweet , tasty treat . even all these little kinks , final fantasy iii great . it got classic replay value . it got punishing challenge appeal fans older games . it got production values topped only squareenix other ds game , mario hoops 3-on-3 . end all end all , it well-done final fantasy game . it one best handheld rpgs long time , needs ds owner collection	1
wow !!! this game so freaking cool !!! colossi amazing ! i've played my share games , i honestly say i've never encountered creatures like these before . i'm only halfway thru game , ( slain 7 colossi 9 more yet go ) , yet each new colossus i meet astounds me all over again . one thing them , i never felt other games , they envoke sympathy towards them . until you find them their own little area their world , they just giant hulks resting peacefully , bothering no one . but once disturbed , they awaken , you must figure out how take each one down . i actually feel sad when they fall . supposedly your character must take them down resurrect his lifeless lover , however i get sense there twist this story before it ends . equally awe-inspiring aspect this game environment which you playing . it without compare most beautiful , mystical , unbelievably gorgeous landscape i've seen any game , ever . world looks , feels , sounds like ancient place time . you just experience it . this one those games i'll remember years today play all over again . this game work art , just certain films ; plus it just so freaking cool !!! don't miss it	1

i've this headset month half so far things working good . it little staticky but price 25 bucks you cant really go wrong . if it comes down little static or restricted lame cord , then i'd rather endure little static . battery life probaly little over 4 hrs which pretty good size unit . miscomfort other reviewers wrote isnt really bad they've made it sound . once again it little unconfortable long length time ( 3 hrs +) or maybe little less others but i dont think i've worn any kind ear piece very comfortable regardless what it designed ( cell phone , xbox , ect . ) one thing keep mind before you purchase , manufacture logitech so i felt good reliability produc t.t acoma	1

your back liberty city ( just like gta 3 ) you cant fly , swim , clime ( just like gta 3 ) no graphics upgrade . no airplanes . glitches like crazy . same psp . but if your looking game just play fun enjoy intresting/funny/good story line than get this . 20 bucks cant go wrong .	1
this definitely game racing fans people who love tuning cars . this game they actually exotic cars ( porsche , lamborghini ) , which makes it even better . they also added cops this game , which they never previous underground games . now game . this game there alot cars . you race old school muscle cars tuned up race car . even police nice fast cars . but they really tough times ( especially suvs ) . storymode actually kept my interest throughout whole game ( unlike others quite boring ) . there blacklist you must beat order become #1 most wanted . this blacklist , there 15 experienced street racers you must beat order get top . they each their strengths , so it get quite challenging times . cool but same time annoying thing when cops interfere middle race once you beat race , you escape them . so it very interesting fun . gameplay , it actually easy get used , even though it may seem difficult . it also not complicated ( ps2 version ) , it mainly like previous need speeds . so you'll learn it like after first race . graphics one things caught my attention . it just so smooth seems real . videos also seem very realistic always fun watch funny ( when you get busted woman ) . overall , there not much else say except , go out buy this game if you love racing games . oh yes , buy black edition	1
it just like cartoon series . my brother ( 7 yrs . old ) play this game hours . i play it ( 18 yrs . old ) find it enjoyable . it gives you something those slow days . there mini missions you complete . you're given awards extras game after each completion . i'd say it 100 hours complete whole game . ( i've 60% one day ... but could just me . i normally devour any game i get . ) graphics great ; story great ; it amusing ; little too colorful but you get used it .	1
this fastest funnest racing game we've ever played . it may not simulated vehicles specific manufacturers , gran turismo , but doesn't matter here because fun comes super-fast racing battling . name takedown implies , lot this game taking your opponents out - forcing them off road , into other cars , etc ... crashes game well-simulated . so much so there crash mode where all you see how much damage your car cause crashing into other vehicles . very fun game high replay value ! p.s. if you into cheat codes , there don't seem any this game . you win different challenges unlock vehicles , events , locations .	1
caesar 4 getting reputation riddled problems . this unfortunate , game itself fine effort developers tilted mill . they achieved admirable balance maintaining elements earlier caesar games , providing something new . improvements certainly graphics game , also distribution system . where c3 you make absolutely certain walkers not options which way they could go , this no longer matters . still , you need build certain way if you wish success . like many others , i crashes when first installing new game . tilted mill tech forum very helpful , turned out i needed install patch my athlon dual core cpu , get all windows updates . you need up date drivers goodly amount free space your hard drive if you want this game run well . that way it , like i said its pity because it cost this game some sales . this game , while enjoyable , lacks depth its predecessor c3 . while many played game , few played it really well , due its unravelling complexity . new game seems deliberately avoided this sort situation , it should easy someone familiar this kind game play high level fairly quickly . music this new game , keith zizza , worth price ammission alone . here major improvement c3 , which quite good music itself . there map editor included , but it quite difficult use , prone crashing , doesn't appear any help file incorporated . it hoped longevity game this addressed . it not lost tilted mill/sierra although c3 made some eight years ago , it still played competitively , due wholly ability players produce good custome-made scenarios . caesar 4 great game . you build truly stunning cities it , more so than any other citybuilder . it pity this means purchasers may need little bit system tidying up get it work properly .	1
this well pu t-t ogether game lots fun play . you'll want play it again soon you finish it . i'm not big star wars fan but i nuts this game . this first rpg i ever tried once i got over fact " i not doing fighting " , i really liked it . i highly recommend this game unless you already weak relationship your wife/kids ( who you won't seeing much ) or if your boss hates you waiting you come late bleary-eyed so he pink-slip you	1
if i pick one system play exclusively , based several factors , i'd choose ds . now , i'm glad i option ( i.e. money ) keep purchasing home consoles , but if some bizarro world where i could only take one system ... well , you get idea . way , ds reminds me ps2 . it bargain . it backwards compatible so it plays gba game . games abundandt perhaps more importantly they varied around $30 . you can't go wrong	1

i owned xbox over 3 years now it really best gaming machine last generation . mine worked perfectly , i love music soundtracks where you load your own cds unto hard drive play them instead certian game sountracks . game selection much better xbox graphics . you get halo , project gotham racing 2 , midtown madness 3 ( must fun game ) , xbox live . i used my xbox play dvds media center extender ( purchase $25 kit comes remote ) it works well , no fumbling your controller like ps2 , just simple remote !	1
many past reviews stated , single player campaign somewhat mixed bag compared it predecessor , call duty 2 . however , if you mainly interested this game it multiplayer features , you find call duty 3 very worthy purchase . i've played through single player campaign spent quite few hours playing multiplayer . i more fun cod2 single player , but cod3 single player still blast . you still get non stop action , tons soldiers around you give you feeling you just soldier among many , not rambo whos going kill everyone yourself , but still makes you feel you making big difference struggle . i wish there couple more scenarios where you operate tanks . there quite few scenarios where you drive jeep . they pretty ho hum . feels like jeep rails . i think cod2 better balance quality vehicle missions . now many fps shooter fans , single player just introduction main attraction , multiplayer . this worth price admission . i've playing online shooters over decade now , cod3 online one most fun . 24 people game , it really feel like war , not just 2 squads going against each other . classes seem pretty balanced each offer their own unique gameplay . it rewarding revive fallen players them thank you . it feels good pop cap players head many yards away he rushing your flag . it feels nice blow up tank bazooka , well seeing player get blown up mine you placed around your base . lot variety bring longevity game . even many players , i rarely experienced lag or disconnections . maps well designed just right size , so far online community seems great . definately far less immature gamers than you'll find halo 2 . bottom line , if you're mainly interested multiplayer , you can't go wrong this game	1

first , let me say i whole-hearedly agree review tiberius . back glory days counter-strike ( 2001-2002 ) , this game be-all end-all 1 ) online video games , 2 ) first-person shooters , 3 ) pc games , 4 ) any video game basically . it real-life weapons , graphics superb time , maps extremely well-made , system requirements still obscenely low , damnit it fun . then , inevitabely , hands time began take their ruthless , indiscriminate toll . video cards supported better graphics , new ( yes , better ! ) games came out ( battlefield 1942 , unreal tournament 2004 ) , hacking became unmistakable poison counter-strike , lot cool , casual gamers grew up or moved . 2000 2004 , counter-strike went utter joy sensation fading diamond nuisance . 2004 present day , it become problem . great games great game developers losing tons money because people still playing this game after five years their mom worn-out 640 megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows 98 . counter-strike still one most popular games all-time , ridiculous number people playing it average day , because people just don't seem enough self-control give up their hopeless addiction . today , server admins , most part , humorless dictators , not stand anything deviates this game undeniable , monotonous drone . people still playing same maps 1.0 release , completely lost all their zest initial potential . it always feels if i've played same round thousand times before , i probably . even custom maps sickening their monotony . fy_iceworld fun 3 consecutive seconds . many other popular custom maps heavy server rotation same way , all look disguisting . i've played probably over 500 servers , downloaded probably over same amount * quality * custom maps , not more than 3 i ever seen server run its rotation , or voted players . furthermore , people still playing game using dial-up , cs veterans always complaining camping , even if its tactic used complete objective . far objectives concerned , counter-strike basically become deathmatch game . no one listen anyone plan ( rare occasion there one ) , no one tries rescue hostages , everyone always calls someone " p***y " or " nub " if you use auto shotgun or awp . top it all off , valve cancelled outstanding won.net replaced it this steam garbage , utility soaking wet incompetence . l337 speak also gained mass popularity jaded counter-strike culture , become its own incessant frustration . but i won't even get into . if you're new cs , don't bother , veterans this game far friendly , you'll probably get called bunch names involving lots zeroes threes if you're beginner . now , if you want indulge yourself great online game , check out world warcraft , battlefield 1942 , sven o-o , or even team fortress classic ( dated game * awesome * community yet lose its initial charm )	1
all i say this game not ' everyone'!! you able read play ! last time i checked not everyone read . i bought this my 13 year old son ... who autisum . he master just every game i get him but he can't read . so , him this game not much fun . i ended up playing more than he i didn't even enjoy it	-1
this game 25 minute introduction or story . square enix really creative stories so good ! however i expect them put something like " skip intro " cause impatient people could really get mad stories ! i , however only get game every five months so i am fine . this only minor flaw . flaw when you want look map or statistics , you wait 5 seconds until it appears . very annoying , but again minor flaw . this game depends how much you like battle same creatures over over over again ! it get very boring after awhile . you train those dumb spirits sometimes you just want them level up quicker . this game gets very boring after awhile you want ditch game well characters . there not much action you limited amount monsters battle . 1.0 ~ 3.5 ----- terrible 3.6 ~ 5 ----- bad 5.1 ~ 6.5 ----- average 6.6 ~ 8 ------- good 8.1 ~ 9 ------ great 9.1 ~ 10 ------ must buy excellent ! graphics- 9/10 great sound -9/10 some voice acting but great fun - 5/10 depends how patient you how you react battling same monster over over again average- 8 my grade- 7 goo	1
graphics aren't most important part game me . i already owned oblivion when i bought gothic 2 because i hoping it would darker more mature " oblivion " style rpg . while it much more mature content than oblivion ,.. i never got see it because bad controls ,.. bad collision lack fun . ( bad collision i'm talking your character walking through or getting stuck objects . ) only weapons you find first tree branch tiny dagger . there no easy enemies fight level 1 character . even little gremlin looking guys first cave pond beginning totally beat crap out you ease . controls make combat unfun chore . i'm patient forgiving gamer but gothic 2 barely half quality elder scrolls 4 : oblivion . if you've never played oblivion don't xbox 360 or pc run it ,.. then maybe you'll get into gothic 2 . it much lower system requirements	1
this game just original + crappy beam system where you spin right when you lock beams gamplay totally repetitive also their isnt any game transforming all !! i hate this game so much !! it literally worst dbz game i ever played { i played them all ) i advise you if ur looking new dbz game wait next one because their shure isnt anything new here but crappy beam system . not buy this game ever !!!!	1
try before you buy ! this game major glitch : its save game files erased sometimes , so you start all over again . beware	-1
game itself very interesting - storyline engaging controls unique . it rpg , which quite switch mario . major problem this game interactivity - not enough it . specifically , there far too many cutscenes not skippable . many these cutscenes lead directly into boss battle . most frustrating instance this just before final boss battle - it takes 10 minutes get " real " fight prior save point . this isn't problem first time through sequence , but if you lose 4 or 5 times , this just becomes hassle makes game not really worth playing see end . this major problem most game designers found work-arounds , but nintendo revealed its lack rpg experience this element . it interesting game , but just make sure win , or friend/sibling/(enemy ? ) skip through dialog sequences you if you get tired them	1
i used my remote all 8 times before it stopped working . even proprietary dongle inserted into controller slot you cannot control this thing controller , you must use remote control . when you take dongle out dvd , screen come up telling reinsert , so if either dongle or remote get slightly injured or malfunction , then you've just wasted thirty bucks . i feel quite ripped off . low cost dvds nowadays , it much better idea buy standalone imho , you get good progressive scan $30 or $40 , which comes out same price . side , it also extremely annoying you can't turn , or off device remote , you must go up box it yourself , especially annoying if you just want watch dvd your bed crash afterwards . all all value proposition offered this product very low considering similarly priced alternatives	-1
playing icewind dale ii reminds me all those novels written american authors late 19th century . though many novels very well written , they never seemed suck me continue reading book . icewind dale ii like . it looks nice , it supposedly improves gameplay , it gives player more character creation options , but i just don't really want play it . why ? well , end day , it seems if icewind dale ii hurt extremely corny story ; it bogged down numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly ; it just not fun its predescessor . i bought this game one reason reason i addicted baldur gate ii needed expand my party based rpg addiction realm . icewind dale ii seemed logical option . i wrong . i immediately confronted story so corny it almost embarassing take part . i confronted gameplay caused me run back forth one place constantly . i confronted battles so easy i soon bored . i tried play it again , but again i plagued same problems . i installed bunch unofficial patches , but those not solve problems terrible puzzles whatever else . overload puzzles corniness would ok if you could diverge one path you could baldur gate ii , where you could accomplish quests order you wanted . here you accomplish everything linear order could never diverge path . furthermore , story seemed retread story original icewind dale . fact , design game seemed paralell it completely . final problem this game concerns fact it difficult play if you no knowledge dungeons dragons rules . if you not know how use rogues or unfamiliar feats like , this game pose very high learning curve you may not want climb . i mostly familiar rules , but it easy see someone who not know them well could easily make mistakes or unfamiliar use certain classes ( even though rule book pretty exhaustive ) . all all , i not think this good game . i would just go baldur gate ii or icewind dale i instead this game .	1
don't buy it unless you want starforce malware your computer . i understand publishers wanting prevent piracy , but not expense replacing drivers i need(ed ) my dvd burner . check search engines see yourself . would otherwise great game , too bad it isn't playable because this malware	-1
my xbox getting red rings death , figured this most likely due overheating , so i bought this thing . not only it not fix any my troubles , i more . whenever i would bump my xbox , whole thing would shut-off instantly . found this out accident , come find out this thing very bad connections . so $20 you buy more headaches than microsoft pawning off onto us game addicts ...	-1
i always fan fighting games . far 3d ones go , i great experience dead or alive series proficiency soul calibur 2 . i fear dead or alive soul calibur may spoiled me though . recently i bought mortal kombat deception found it horribly awkward * compared fluid battles soul calibur or dead or alive . i felt same way when i played tekken 5 . unlike graceful awesome animations dead or alive or soul calibur , movements characters tekken 5 unrealistic absurd . try out christie tekken 5 example . her idle animation preposterous . if you access dead or alive 3 , try putting out leifang . her idle animation thing beauty . every one her moves flows perfectly one next . this kind grace seriously lacking clunky tekken 5 . now let us speak character design . tekken 5 characters boring uninspired . they run gamut miscellaneous boxer 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , miscellaneous karate fighter 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . oh . there also few shrieky girls tight clothing , some which seem asian , if that your thing . then there guy cat mask . awesome sounds , it looks silly game . if you ever played practice mode dead or alive you probably recall fondness there feature shows each move command top screen keeps it there until you successfully perform move . this feature , useful it , not present tekken 5 . fair , it isn't found any other fighting game i played , but it really should . without further ado , let me simply say i not recommend buying tekken 5 if you ever played soul calibur or dead or alive . intro video much excitement game offer ( i especially enjoyed suicidal bicycle girl rescued kitten ) . * but least mortal kombat deception puzzle kombat , which rocked my socks	1
i started caesar2 back when it came out . i played it hours hours loved it . when caesar3 came out i bought too loved it even more spent even more time playing . both caesar2 3 rarely crashed . things changed!i'm spending more more my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it . 8 out 10 times i access area where you trade other cities it crashes . without trading , you make little money game essentially over . other problems i'm seeing overall performance . i don't fastest machine ( amd 2.1 ghz , 512ram , rockin ' video card 256meg mem ) but there irritating 1 second delays addition crashes . i find whole game difficult use . this not case caesar3 . unless they issue patch , i'm feel frustrated crashes . maybe i dumb down graphic setting get rid delays . my suggestion ? wait patch before buying --- or move . - jason	1
this preview spoilers game please don read it if you didn play it ! i played xenogears when i saw xenosaga episode kinda short compare xenogears battle system but ok because xenosaga like " introduction " . ok improvements : gameplay longer than episode 1 ( i ended episode 1 everything 42 hours ) change ep2 ( 88+) . sidequest like plus if you want it it if you don you end game anyways . idea epiloge after you finish game very cool because you could kill special bosses get better kill final boss overkilled stuff like . chaos jr momo shion kosmos looking improved they looked more grow up . battle system put them up or down depending who you using or fighting well double tech attacksall characters able use all magic skills long you buy them your skillpoints making able sidequests . momo bow very nice improvement now she very good damage dealerrecover mp while stock good idea well use ep freely without any trouble . people complain because history focus jr urtvs but title says itself ( jenseits von gut und bse ) means " beyond good evil " wich means " rubedo worring ladies danger his red dragon mode wich makes him go out control ( possible reason sakura death ) , albedo his obssesive love rubedo but same time kill him well , nigredo wich refused mission ( involved rubedo ) killed his own father but he plays good person moment albedo said " giving life 1 hand delivering death other " . honestly second episode history role more development than first one because wasn introduction we starting know how things going ... what they wrong : i don see how they could think throw away tech attacks going good idea ... good thing they added tech attacks special attacks ep 3 you stock lot times make good combo characters(wich made battles kinda boring)music battle kinda boring compare ep 1voices chaos(sounded boring ... ) kos-mos ( like fake silly girl trying play robot ) shion ( pushing like " i better than you " ) momo ( very annoying ) sad thing my main team chaos kosmos momo thats why i got sad voice changes but they said they refix their voices episode 1 third last episode . ep 1 almost 8 hours movies ep 2 4:30 hours ( i guess complains long movies)i still don get it movies give more motion storyrole game wich most attractive things xenosaga over most games . episode 3 4hours full motion movies but plus speak texts faces included while characters move stuff like valkyrie profilethey cut completly close up when they cast spells or hit lights stuff most time you see characters back all way while you fighting . ( they fix ep3)in resume everyone know episode 2 bad things but well good things ( every game ) no they shouldn it bad when they noticed things people like game itself . good thing they fixed most bad stuff episode 2 episode 3 . battle system soundtrack characters voices all better only thing i didn like episode 3 battle mode they make it appear average rpg system ( attack , ether , tech , special tech , others ) so forget 4 combinations make tech attacks ethers cost " ep(cp ) " special attacks cost boosts . i wonder if attack give some " ep(cp ) " later . even all this i recommend you buy it before you get episode 3 because you losing lot storyline if you don more now they cost 20 dollars each ( or less)atte : roy_master	1
i've never bought wireless controller before ... so i wasn't sure what expect . but it turns out , this probably most comfortable video game controller world . logitech wireless ps2 action controller every bit comfortable dualshock 2 , then some . it very curvy controller fits almost too perfectly into palms your hands , buttons placed great . buttons never noticeably stick , full d-pad hundreds times better than sony segmented d-pad , analog sticks extremely sensitive , responding lightest touch , there start/select/analog buttons there 9though analog called mode this controller ) , new button turns vibration or off . placement these four good enough you won't using them often anyways . lag time wonderful this controller . there no noticeable lag whatsoever . radio frequency causes no interference , reciever small barely noticable , if not bit , dare i say it , " cute " . controller weight excellent too . it runs batteries , yet unbelievably light . battery door not stick out back uncomfortably either . your batteries also last you 50 - 300 hours vibration on/off . you won't even know you're playing it when you're middle violent gunfight somewhere . it just good . size also comfortable barely larger than dualshock 2 . plus , there no cords trip over , pull out controller slot , or add mess cords behind your entertainment center . there one small bad point this . vbration feature not good dualshock . but there just too many good things here this controller make it invaluable buy , even this minor drawback . verdict : guilty charges most invaluable piece ps2 hardware ( aside console itself ! ) world . sentenced bought consumers around world . case dismissed	1
this my second ps2 . i traded my first xbox 360 , which only lasted 91 days before it died ( read all it my 360 review ) . leary version 1.0 ps3 , i opted go back ps2 its proven reliability copious games less money . i got set hdtv cables , wireless controller , not looked back . what fool i fall microscams empty promises ! this best game system ! you even play online free ! games more challenging last lot longer than 360 games , which i could beat week , playing hour day . warranty awesome 1 year parts labor ! i am not worried , however , because i my original ps2 10 years without issue before trade-in ! fantastic system unbeatable price ! i keep this one least year before trading it ps3 , once all bugs fixed price goes down $400 .......... until then , long live ps2 !!!	1
unlike any other game you've ever played -- best possible way . i am easily bored and/or grossed out traditional racing , shooting , killing zombie games this game refreshing change . challenging enough keep you entertained quite long time . other reviewers said it ends too soon , but game lets you repeat each level beat your previous best score . so , if you barely beat level , you it over until you totally blown it out water . perfect pair obsessive-compulsives like my fianc� me . he thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than i his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it , too . there isn't anything would inappropriate any age , but kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it . ( after he goes bed we play insanely gory jaws game -- you get shark !! ) you might think rolling up stuff make big ball would get old fast , but king all cosmos keeps it exciting challenges surprises . levels just get cooler cooler . also , music fantastic . it you singing no time . na na na na na na na na katamari damashi ! it doesn't even make sense but i love it ! i just ordered second katamari game , " we love katamari . " `nuff said .	1
i loved this game so much i gone got second copy , mine stopped working ! i love feeling entire world lives within game you always just steal car ride , listen radio take vice city many sites . tommy vercetti - excellantly cast ray liotta goodfellas fame gets out slammer goes back his turf . he gets sent vice city get him out way because really , they don't want him around anymore they certainly don't want answer his questions why he got jailed . you ride bikes , take cars , helicopter fly over city , go through districts different cultures work many gangs . bikers , columbians cops even , accompanied sound track beats heck out any other game i've played . radio enough variation keep everyone happy they their drive-bys cruise looking women . talk shows ! classy touch . game play smooth barely bug seen flows day night back again city sync , vice city night amazing , you also get weather variations impact , rain , bikes tend skid more you fall off . it kind attention detail means game never grows tiresome . hidden jumps all manner vehicles taxi/paramedic , etc missions mean game really so open ended . it three years i'm still exploring vice city . classic	1

i'm going keep this short because game doesn't deserve review longer than actual game play . great idea , tons fun , addictive , short . my only complaint , just when i digging game , i beat it . alittle disappointing , definitely worth $20 , just make sure you something else after you beat it	1
overall , i am pretty happy this unit . my only complaint it little underpowered far grabbing my router signal . my laptop 5 bars basement , but i typically only get two xbox 360 this adapter . because this , it drop its signal occasional my linksys wrt54gs router . however , it also 50 ft . away ( assuming direct line ) two floors several walls way . still , using this unit much better than figuring out how hardwire my xbox two floors away . setup breeze . i plugged it ( it snaps nicely into back 360 plugs into nearby usb using short cord ) , went network setting 360 , selected wireless slot , found my network , typed my wpa key my router . . it took all 5 minutes start finish . until buying this , i just dragged 100 ' ethernet cable down steps through doorways anytime i wanted connect xbox live . what pain ! this not perfect solution if you lot space stuff your router xbox 360 , but fine my needs , which mostly includes downloading xbox marketplace , occasional online play . if you avid xbox live player , you setup like mine , you might want consider hardwire solution . you may ocassionally lose your signal middle game .	1
this very flashy , very fun car chase shooting game . you get over 20 different vehicles guns . tv-like gameplay makes good story line . there hardly any dialogue cut scenes , but this one first ps2 games . gran theft auto : $50 . driv3r : $30 . starsky hutch : priceless	1
xbox dvd movie playback kit very easy set up use . all you plug little receiver into one controller ports , put dvd enjoy . buttons remote responsive easy get used . however , xbox dvd system very simple . it doesn't any eject buttons ( something mentioned many times other reviewers ) not many options more expensive stand-alone dvd players . you keep mind it made people who already xbox don't want shell out extra $50 dvd player lot special features when all they want able watch movie . dvd itself runs exactly it would good stand-alone dvd player . it sort like one those little $100 digital cameras . there isn't anything really special them . they just take good pictures you put your computer .	1
i agree some reviews rush need keep up happiness tied immigrant status . said - i spent endless hours researching building thoroughly enjoyed this game . well worth cost enjoyable . i am not familiar other civ games - looking more city building game set past , similar my favorite game children nile - perhaps explains why i not disappointed	1
this game fun play but not greatest game either . course movie way better than game . game pretty easy short considering there 18 levels . storyline beginning could alittle better well . some missions pretty hard but after you pass tough ones it just gets easy again . all all it good game . i would recommend it . graphics good , i like how they put some storyline movie . it not bad game play .	1

much said technical aspects or systems requirements game , many reviews oblivion other next-gen or advanced games market today . caesar iii quite old , sequel always going further system demands . it worth wait . let talk game : basic gameplay intuitive . not lot you haven't before . interface pretty standard minimized off screen screenshots or just zooming around without distraction . which you really should . all these types games , you spend lot time building developing . you need get cup tea sit back this one , closeup views city work play what so new here . graphics look somewhat standard zoom out , top down view . there lot looks familiar . until you start get closer look texture details come life you realize there level realism here you watch shadows lengthen plaza near sparkling fountain midday sun moves across sky trees sway breeze . wow . no other roman game out currently comes close . this everything you always wanted caesar iii somewhat cotn , ( children nile ) although buildings here more substantial better realized . cotn feature able follow behind person they move streets , saving you hassle trying maneuver camera views get realistic walkthru experience , one they should implemented here . i would liked see more variety housing , also goods , particulary food . there only three foods , grain , vegetables meat - cattle . no figs , cheeses , fruits , pork , chicken or fish . production lines very simplified , no bakeries bread no weavers cloth . grain goes households wool straight clothing or armor factories . more decorative options should available well . overall , while quality what exists very good , there certainly room expansion . i hope they address these things games come . it part appeal adds longevity continued interest game . maps overall somewhat small , although game this graphic intensive would reasonably limit size facilitate performance . there very limited sandbox modes available , least now , i find no user created scenarios currently available due part complexity unsupported editor . but again , what there very good indeed . all structures beautifully attention detail . landscape breathtaking , variety ways put your city together around terrain . enough hustle bustle city streets bring it life . i mention you zoom all way down into arena or colliseum , watch closeups games or swivel around floor arena watch all spectators coming out moving around or cheering ? i am currently running mid-line gaming system nvidia 6800 , system run oblivion fairly well . i update some drivers well defragment my hard drive run this game smoothly . i hadn't experienced many lags until i built up larger city or playing several hours my system started protest . i replaced game launcher icon installed game desktop or program files shortcut i created game file caesar . exe actually get game start , something i found forums consistent problem . there some bugs trade routes . opening them before you goods doesn't seem problem much setting ports sell goods you sell but don't stock yet . i'm not thrilled number people it takes man each prefect , but it usually seems work well enough , except high speeds where frequency fires seems increase , but if you more than two or three buildings burning you better off destroying those rebuilding than waiting them get put out . you easily find your entire city flames very quickly ! while it certainly few faults , most things matter preference adequate , clean system . core game itself fundamentally solid . it takes work build up economic stability based trade taxes how well you handle your production chains . you create , any scenario , stable cities largely run themselves , aside requests/demands empire . your ratings screen tell you things you need meet your goals . instance - prosperity would also mean higher levels housing , especially villas , well successful taxation trade . better educational coverage not only affects culture rating , it affects security rating because better education means less crime good coverage jupiter , who frequently remove all criminals his blessing . good religious coverage affect both your prosperity culture ratings you then evolve your housing . military automatically meet threat city doesn't require lot micromanagement long you everything place well supplied . stable gameplay , depth , realistic economic simulation , great music breathtaking graphics , it not only very good game but best current selection city-builders . so if you chose , i would recommend this one first . enjoy	1
honest , i little wary disgaea 2 . first game so much fun , i bit worried sequel would just suck . worry not , fair gamers , disgaea 2 takes most ( though not all ) what good first game builds upon it . incredibly humourous localization ? check . colorful anime-styled artwork ? check . detailed , amusing , slightly outdated 2d sprites ? check . highly amusing strangely moving storyline ? check . etna ? check . dark assembly ( new improved so it much more enjoyable) ? check . my only quibble they stripped out lot unlockable classes , which takes little bit fun out obsessively levelling your characters . however , you tell my rating , only quibble , it totally balanced out all other improvements they made . overall , if you enjoyed first game , you'll enjoy this one just much . i'm so very thankful this not suffer " sequel-itis .	1
i've only this controller few days , i found layout same black controller . i wish thumb controls little softer , they hurt my thunb while playing exciting game	1
this first karaoke revolution game i received , i enjoy it very much ! however , songs game i found quite old , even someone like myself , senior college . i dont know rest you , but 80 blur me . i didnt know these songs very well , which put major hinderance game play . i liked high amount songs they put he recent game , but i already ordered karaoke revolution volume 3 after seeing more recent songs i would know . i found " sing dance " mode challenging , if you dont know song heart , dont play it , because you need watching arrows where your feet should going . i would also recommend wireless microphone dance pad ( if they exist ) since cord get way your dancing moves . i thought it really cool game sense initiative , over 50 different unlockable items ( although 90% which items you use create your character , or just new character ) . some songs listed here need unlocked through game play . i'm sorry i couldnt think every artist these songs , but if it isnt listed , assume its least 15 years ago . 1 .

xenosaga : episode 1 took us . although flaws game many , story sufficiently entertaining interesting warrant praise given game , clunky play mechanics . xenosaga : episode 2 awful . plain simple , it awful . any interesting cliff-hangers episode 1 either answered stupidly , or not all . game not only possessed lackluster storyline , extra characters introduced merely confusion sake , but i never seen battle system more user-unfriendly , more monotonous clunky than episode 2 . times , i wanted throw my ps2 against wall , particularly when fighting patriarch . terrible game which seemed kill series ...... until episode 3 , which throwback simpler rpg fare , works quite well . episode 3 , battles actually interesting fight ( least early - i enjoy use boost counter once ! ) . no more you guess whether shion attack useful against enemy , or whether you should switch , say , chaos . instead , characters divided into three classes : attackers , defenders supporters ( healers ) . it pretty simple system , no ? also , story kicks back into high gear . i won't spoil anything , except say finally , testaments , which alluded episode 1 but completely ignored ( other than tangential referral ) episode 2 , returned , let face it : wilhelm much more compelling character than , say , young albedo . finally , wheels which began spinning episode 1 come full circle . fact , it seems if episode 2 could skipped entirely , no loss continuity . there numerous nods xenogears this game , way , gear sequences actually quite fun ( character battles episode two only trumped boredom ... gear battles ) . any case , xenosaga 3 worthy addition library . it flaws ( again , it would nice action sequences movie sequences move more seamlessly , although it infinitely better than episode 1 or 2 ) , but it fun game	1
this game remains one my favorite games all time . i'm old school game , i've played computer games since i atari st cartridge . i played other gta games , i liked them very much , they all addictive . this one , this one trully jewel crown . there many things i could say , but i just don't want repeat same waffle . it great game , characters all superb , voiced great actors . ray liotta just fire tommy vercetti . i'm still suprised they got all this talent , there seems no stone un turned , even blondie get minor par t.t his many thumbs way up . indeed , it notorious , it not minors , though no doubt there more minors played this than adults . lot it subject matter just kicks , just teh kind amusement we seek because it kind thing we would never normally our wildest dreams ; other part , inmo , jsut sheer style . i can't recommend this title enough . only possible downside it , this just picky loading times various parts city . this eliminated san andreas , but this one one . " i run this town ! me !! " - tommy vercetti	1
pros : 1 . character creation fun , detailed basically unmatched any game market , much better than nwn creation system . 2 . graphic beautiful , but if you expecting fully 3d environment , you disappointed . 3 . music just awesome . 4 . i mention character creation fun ! playing your custom made party very satisfying experience . any kind team playable , you solo game too if you like . cons : 1 . not feature 3d environment like nwn2 . gameplay linear , but i didn't care point my game develope my character	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction : i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released gamecube very high quanitites , so you're gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available gamecube very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame gamecube version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan .	1
i played several nancy drew games this far best one . i recommend this game anyone .	1

while it shares name " chrono " many people think it horrible sequel , it fact not direct sequel like so many people think it . it very well rounded amazing game play , it follows up twenty years after fall lavos . keep mind when playing this game it chronological sequel rather than direct sequel so many people fail realize . while game numerous playable characters , it still maintains very good story , if you follow it closely , but times , become very confusing if you miss certain details . chrono cross net you around 30-40 hours gameplay , if you don't stop playing game extended amounts time , story just becomes completly amazing	1

mario kart double dash essentially mario kart 64 then some . game brings alot new cards table , which i review below . mario kart double dash improved last game immensely , saying alot , because mario kart 64 one most fun games available n64 . first way it improved previous game allowing players choose 2 characters race instead 1 . this makes bit more complex control scheme , but otherwise doubles fun . game also features tons available characters play : mario luigipeach daisywariowalluigibowser baby bowserkoopa paratroopababy mariobaby luigidonkey kong diddy kongyoshi , andbirdothe game ol ' grand prix mode time trials , but it also some new unlockable features , such : new cartsnew charactersa new circuitnew battle mode stages ... more , but i don't want spoil anything . mario kart double dash multiplayer modes better than ever , too . not only battle versus modes once again available , but there new types battles : shine theif babomb blast . all all , mario kart double dash extremely fun replayable , enough features unlockables keep you occupied entertained while . i enjoy it , i think any gamecube owner should pick this game up . i reccomend renting it first see if you like it , then making your decision . thanks reading , bubba " samus	1

i got earlier design this controller . it bigger felt better than regular dual-shock . only down side it analog sticks . top curves like bowl not like knob no grip which means my thumbs kept slipping off . this new controller away problem goes back old knob style analog sticks more grip ... but it size regular controller now but rounded . it fit well hand uses only 2 aa batteries . this controller great , but if when it stop working like other reviewers say , i swap out analog sticks my old logitech controllers .

i recieved this gift christmas day surprise . however , there mishap wal mart i guess mic they told my parents would work actually didn't so i hadn't able play until yesterday . however , now it all sorted out i finally able play using usb ps2 head set . game actually so much fun . first time i tried i went familiar songs , so i selected " pieces me " . i so bad first time it laughable , it failed me just i started second verse . but game gets so much better after your first few tries . after while i easily getting gold expert judging ( i immidiately like challenge myself ) . i breezing through songs i grew up loving such irene cara " fame " , wild cherry " play funky music " , vicki sue robinson " turn beat around " . then i going through songs dominating my cd player not too long ago such ashlee simpson " pieces me " , incubus ' " drive " , beyonce " crazy love " , hilary duff " fly " . it even better classics such madonna " material girl " , blondie " call me " , commodores " brick house " , whitney houston " i always love you " ( one many i haven't quite nailed yet ) . now order make platinum beyonce you actually sing like her ? no , which makes game very accessable . however , it doesn't hurt familiar your singing voice . over all this very fun game only one problem . while songs may fun , it very very diverse . sometimes too diverse it own good . take example when me my mom want play , songs we personally know two different erras . i'm wanting bust out " call me " , she wanting " i left my heart san francisco " . this creates only problem : unless your all around music-know-it-all ( which i'm not quite there yet ) you'll end up doing same songs over over again . but this really doesn't bring game down . if you've around listened wide variety songs then you should able cover good 30 songs . not mention , it would make great party game . i would suggest getting this game if you're into fun while not afraid make fool yourself	1
this so wonderful . i 7yr old ( boy ) 9yr old ( girl ) they cannot get enough this . my 9yr old sleep over other girls now want come over all time play ! i even some parents inquiring it . this so much fun , even my husband i great time playing . kids love you creat your own characters change their outfits anytime when you well you unlock new songs outfits . we can't wait get microphone so we more .	1

( yes , i'm 29 years old she still can't it ! ) . i'd recommend this game anyone not looking advanced game requiring weeks play advanced storyline . if you like tetris but want little more variety just little more skill requirement ( good laugh ) , this game you . there something oddly satisfying rolling over dog seeing his legs twitter air when 5 minutes earlier he pushing you around ... weird ? yes . fun ? yes . i'd say good 12+ years because young kids may find this too boring because they won't appreciate how strange cool this game really	1

( way , avoid ds game called " sudoku " . it unnecessarily clunky entering data . ) this appropriate game seniors who like math/logic challenges even if they've never used computer . plan spend some time tutoring newbie , then watch he or she enjoys challenge	1
this game reminds me alot grand theft auto series . while it many similar characteristics way you get around town , go into buildings , way you interact environment it still manages offer few original interesting components gaming industry . this game great storyline fans likely enjoy . even if you weren't fan movie this game still must . like gta there few side missions ( not massive gta though ) , there collectibles , then you main missions way . while object game take over new york , some warehouses businesses get repetitive , but its mostly all fun . one plus police this game tend less hassle unlike gta games . this lets you keep playing rather than stop restart safehouse or police station . this helps speed up game . controlls take time get used but after you play little while you good go . if you like gta format style play you certainly like this . also if you like godfather , storyline game great really stays true movie . while its not best game year it certainly until new gta comes out . it took me 2 weeks finish game playing few hourse each night . i hope they come up godfather 2 . we see ...	1

this truly amazing game , especially considering it made small independent developer . there virtually infinite number different unit types , spells magic items so game never gets repetitive ( this possible * because * it doesn't rely massive amounts graphics ) . different nations each their own style play . ai challenging even when set " easy " . you download new maps other modifications internet . i only reduced rating 4 because problems interface . it sort unfinished feel it . example when game ends , it always exits windows rather than main menu . also , running multiplayer game very difficult requires executing two instances game simultaneously	1

if you liked first disgaea you just love second one ! game builds upon all strong points previous game . now instead taking forever get powerful characters you achieve characters like archer , ninja , etc . much quicker . main characters still hilarious , i love fact you get see laharl , etna gang again this one .

red dead revolver , far , one best western games i've ever played . game easy learning curve also . after hour or so play you all controls down , you'll hooked or otherwise very interested . it one best story-lines out any other games i know . basically , western tale revenge renegade southern general his colonel . you play red harlow whose father brutally murdered right front him colonel darien , again , general diego right hand man . i wouldn't say this game bad rating makes it . there no actual dismemberment , rating " blood gore " says , use curse words kept minimum . if you've seen any pg-13 rated movies , two could relate . it fun time killing game , if you're bored , great replay value people who don't plan finishing single player modes . there tons characters choose multiplayer mode , both good bad . multiplayer modes numerous also , including things like showdown dueling modes . downfalls this game short story mode overall simpleness it . there aren't many ways you get creative it . but , greatest thing it i believe : sheer hilariousness it ! me friend sat played it more than 4 hours night once , sat holding our sides , crying , because laughter . midget clowns character reactions funny . especially how it sometimes glitches up . once during boss fight very fat character , fat enemy got hung stairwell , because he too big go through it . overall very good game ! you should buy this , if you like this game , you may want purchase gun too . gun copied off red dead revolver most part though . both games very short stories too . if you like good western great replay value , then you certainy love red dead	1

great remake , but where fast forward ! my kingdom fast forward button ! this great game ! cut scenes nice touch helped draw player into story line , but would someone please give me fast forward/skip button . i understand makers game want you get involved appreciate storyline , but without fastforward/skip button , this game game limited replay value . i already played through game once , now i am running through it again , i am going insane ! long cut scenes , seemingly endless , " next " clicks fine first time , but come ! game 3 different endings you would figure developers would give you break ! ok , now i said , lets get back review . character development use magical items , while definitely not unique , but they helped flesh out fight scenes . combos skills moves made game interesting kept me coming back . while i would liked see graphics slightly change when different equipment used ( swords , helms , etc ) combat special moves graphics definitely nice . should you buy ? sure if you like rpg game definitely buy , but fore warned ... prepared read , read , read , click click click , before you even get your first fight scene , even then expect much same long before you get things your own	1
i purchased copy game year edition end may , 2006 . it now almost september . i playing morrowind three months most week day evenings 4 hours most weekends 12 hours . game great graphics , character interaction fairly intricate though times repetitive , game ai monsters non-player characters fairly advanced , game manipulation fairly easy learn , layers complexity somewhat challenging though not overwhelming , most importantly one or two puzzles i come across thus far straightforward resolve . most various quests not terribly intricate difficult so they lend themselves jumping few hours then taking break . i wanted game would visually appealing , simple game manipulation mechanics , interesting but easy puzzles , mysteries , above all provide immersive virtual world explore . i wanted inexpensive game would run older 900mhz amd thunderbird nvidia fx5200 128mb video card 1 gb ram . morrowind fits bill nicely . i ignored all faqs manuals how play game most those provide spoilers instructions most opportune or expedient path . i discussed game some my students who moved oblivien , fourth game series . all all , this best 20 bucks i ever spent game . previous this i played call duty civilization ii extensively some other strategy games bit . i play dungeons dragons group friends college some 20 years ago so fantasy ideas embedded game familiar	1

one most common complaints xenosaga ep . ii battle system annoying ponderous because " even ' regular ' battles , it forces you spend many turns stocking just so you decent damage enemies . " this actually form codespeak . what these people really saying " i'm not very bright , even after several hours playing ep . ii , i somehow never realized how use battle system efficiently . " ep . ii puts great deal emphasis each character attack attributes . attacks classified either physical or ether , then there elementals ( fire , ice , lighting , aura ) finally there types ( slash/pierce/hit ) . sound complicated ? eh , little more so than average rpg . not nearly bad something like vagrant story . all you use analyze any enemy you're unfamiliar see their weaknesses , then use change command bring character proper attack . when you come across enemies physical/elemental weaknesses , there ethers which you cast add element character physical attack . if their weakness ether/elemental , then just use standard elemental spell ethers against them . this all you need make battles flow nice , normal pace . some reason , vast majority ep . ii players seemed never realize this . instead , they saw their only option using stock command nine ( nine ! ) turns row before beginning their attack . even wimpy garden variety wandering monsters ! they took no heed enemy weaknesses , using characters physical/fire based attacks against enemies weak vs . ether/ice . rpg players used reputation more intelligent gamers . i wonder what happened ... lot ep . i fans never bothered play ep . ii because negative word mouth spread so quickly amongst fanbase soon jp version released . but now ep . iii out ( it truly fantastic ) lot them finally play ep . ii soon . i hope they better than first rounders	1
when i heard square putting out game disney fronting it i even keel . i don't much love disney but rings true mario well i still played mario rpg . however , unlike mario rpg ( here just " mario " ) final fantasy ( ff ) characters weren't featured . i'm all little cosmetic upgrade squall cloud since graphics when their games made now quite gap . one thing i didn't expect some most powerful beloved characters video game history would take back seat kid key weapon . these two protagnosits particular much more emotional development struggle then " sora " ever . this beyond frusterating . after all cloud through , he still seen this weak willed person no direction or purpose life . squall other hand ( unlike cloud psychological battle ) , huge distancing emotional issues overcome , especially abandonment . but ff8 he showed final boss greiver what . know i put so much time 2 games gave me reason truly care all 8 members either given game , i couldn't care less sora his friends or fate every disney world . lame square lame . you some most highest grossing games both rpg over all history you still sold out disney ? i come expect more company caused me stay up so many nights , miss so much homework miss out so many life experiences . thank god you didn't disgrace some your more advanced titles ( xenogears vagrant story come mind ) . well thats my review any true square fan take it or leave it but while you play your game just remember who your dishonoring	1

this my first experience sim city . i've never played earlier versions . important note : computer prompts you type code white box lower left part back cd case . well , i looked looked , it wasn't where prompt said it would . after five minutes thinking my eyes playing tricks me , i finally found code . it back owners manual located inside cd case . you'll find it very top back cover manual , not lower left corner . tutorials helpful , so if you're new all this i highly recommend you go through those first . if you feel you need go through them again , you reset tutorials start fresh all over . i'll built small city , i've only this game day , but i know i'm going love it .	1
i'm not 1st/3rd person shooter fan . but this game graphics sheer re-playability won me over . i actually played battlefront ii before i , but original seems much much better than seque l.p.s. best star wars game ever : x-wing alliance . what i say , i'm old-school	1
my kids ( 11 7 , 2nd 6th graders ) first played this game friend house . they both begged it . they not stopped playing it . thing we live texas sometimes it just way too hot play outside . there always news reports kids just sitting around . this game makes you move !!! they played so hard first day they got it they both so sore next day . i recommend this toy several people . first , if you need get your kid moving , this great . if you hyper children need outlet , this great . if you need exercise more , this great . if weather doesn't permit your active kid go outsice this toy great . if your kid wants see him or herself tv this great ! if your kid afraid try new things front others , this great . this toy got my boy sign up little league . both my kids already active , so they play hard , but it irresistable temptation even inactive kids . everyone neighborhood loves it	1

memory card 1019 nintendo excellent saving gamecube saves . i used delete old save files favor ones newer games . some games required so much space it impossible save anything them . i tried some 3rd party brands before , but gamesaves often became corrupted . i this memory card nearly year now nothing i saved become corrupted . even nearly 60 different gamesaves it , some some rather large games like sims 2 , i still more than enough space left . price bit more expensive , but its quality more than made up it already	1

i got this game during summer expecting it great fun . well ... it caught my interest few weeks then i just got bored it . i'd only recomend it people who not get bored easily	1
i guess first thing i'll say i got jedi academy before i got this game . i hugely dissaponted . i really liked jedi academy but this game not great . i cheat codes so i all wepons all amo i undying . there partes this game insainly tought . there way many puzzles - i don't mind puzzles but there simply way many . some them insainly hard . i would recomend you get jedi knight : jedi academy - way better puzzles aren't insain you get choose what you look like .... well i could go but i'll leave it there . if you aredy jedi academy you want star wars game $20 then you sould get battlefront thats anoter great game . just don't get this game .	1
i loved " incredibles , " so i excited play game . i've only playing video games last couple years , only off , so i'm really just beginner . perhaps explains enormous difficulty i've this game . my boyfriend long-time video game player , he able things one or two tries i labored hours over . even using cheat codes not really help me all much . i surprised when i read review said game too easy . i almost cried . lol but seriously , unless you good gamer , you're probably going more frustrated than challenged this game . me , i guess i'll stick action rpgs	-1
i bought this game whim , really liked need speed : hot pursuit 2 . this game needs help . first all , frame rate lower than it should . there slow-down well . even game before this , need speed : underground 2 looked 100 times better . car models most wanted touch nicer-looking there far better selection than underground 2 , but that only plus this game it . you don't race much fly around city barely-controlled frenzy , trying stay ahead computer cars . winning more luck than skill . he or she who hits least obstacles wins . hardly enjoyable way race ! i get too stressed when playing this game , so i put it away while . definitely rent before buying this game .	1
this game originally released 10 dollars . almost everything it pulled straight diablo not quite good . though this game few things it interesting , enjoyable some people , i would just skip this game go diablo 2	-1

this supposed x-box cleaner , but system not read disc . shoddy product	-1
i want take moment address battle system license system . these systems , while well-conceived , completely ruined game me . example , license system , itself , very good idea : it allows player craft character his liking tastes . problem lies execution . say , example you want learn " steal . " not only you get license it but you also purchase it game . this presents problems . my game , example , my characters possess suite licenses they cannot use because shops don't carry particular item . system gives you flexibility but snatches it away requiring you not only get license but also find item . i can't help but feel hobbled license system . because these items ( which require licenses ) come discrete parts game , developers cunningly shot up difficulty . it doesn't matter i earned license " shield fire " level 4 , i only get it level 20+ when its offered shop ! game very challenging precisely because mechanics prevent characters getting better-than-normal equipment after they earned license . sly , artificial way developers ffxii ramped up difficulty strips away seems almost arbitrary unnecessary . cap three playable characters ( one time ) straw breaks camel back . lastly , battle system , my opinion , isn't fitting console rpg . it feels like i am playing world warcraft or city heroes . enemies always faster than you . it nigh impossible chase them down they always able catch up you . fighting bow exercise futility : enemies catch you because game freezes you place during firing . r2 button , which allows you flee , borders useless outright deadly use . while fleeing , game prevents you interacting objects . so if you flee toward door , you stop , pause , let them hit you , before you escape . my mouth gaped open when i saw reviews game online . this game received astronomical scores , some heralding it best final fantasy ever . shocks me beyond belief . ffxii would better mmorpg even sharper two-player rpg . single-player game , shoddy a.i mechanics , game plays like tumbling rock . perhaps i am just too old school , but this game tastes too much like lollipops bubblegum . your mileage may vary .	1
i bought this product after reading you update code list via network connection , or using usb flash drive . i not able get either work correctly . after following their instructions datel website how update codes using usb drive , it deleted my game saves memory card . it also corrupted memory card , corrupted saves card slot 2 . i nothing but trouble it , it slow doesn't live up promises . their customer support lousy , response merely said ... sorry . well thanks lot them ... just lost hours game saves !!	-1

i'm going start this review saying i came wii lifetime pc-only gamer . i never felt need buy console until wii its fun controller system came out . aspect i most excited controlling first person shooters just precisely intuitively mouse keyboard , together added entertainment using it other motion-activated actions within game ( rowing , throwing grenades , close combat , etc ) . result , after spending night out cold get my console , flushed excitement seeing all merchandise , i grabbed three games : zelda ( no-brainer ) , trauma center , call duty 3 . those three titles , i'm sorry say cod 3 one leave bitter taste my mouth . i stated before , i am pc gamer ; i'm really into my hobby , love satisfaction building pc which manage all latest games . i played cod 1 2 pc , greatly enjoyed both . far biggest problem wii version , however , especially someone accustomed playing computer , graphical shortcomings title . i literally no idea what going . i could barely tell which direction enemies coming only reason why i going right direction because linear construction most levels . added this , i no idea how get rid first german engage me hand hand combat ( much advertised feature , which actually just interactive cut-scene ) . i followed instructions wave my controllers around wildly , although i worked myself into frenzy ( causing my dogs panic think something really attacking me ) inevitable german ( i tried throwing all my grenades into room he hides ) kept clubbing me death . even beyond this setback , i found controls often quite poorly implemented . it also disappointing ( yet speaks volumes ) grenade ' throwing ' function involves you actually ' throwing ' nunchuck ( without letting go , way , unless you've got backup tv ) disabled default ; trying use it usually gets you miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up . record , i know wii controller works . i've played many hours other games already ( system conveniently informs you ) . this just seems like shoddy implementation it . i definitely tell you there lot ambition here convey frenzy war , some obvious strong attempts creating absorbing combat scenes . nevertheless , it essentially boils down messy soup blurry pixels which , even my gameplay-over-graphics mentality buying wii , blocks enjoyability this title . honest , it made me think ww2 isn't best-suited area wii . after all , these historical titles tend rely great deal cinematically portraying visceral splendor war , rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements . my advice fps front : wait wii ' far cry ' game see how turns out . meantime , there countless hours other great titles more suited wii graphics waiting your attention . before leaving you , i'd just like clarify thing : this perspective someone who very little experience consoles . perhaps you're reaction game very different if you come wii straight gamecube instead pc/high definition gaming . oh , if you're still determined buy it , keep eye out my used copy game ; i'm going need money ' banana blitz ' ..	1

main appeal grand theft auto franchise always freedom it gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem he sees fit . san andreas contains far most audacious expansion landmass available you . this time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos , san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas , all within enormous state san andreas . main inspiration this time around fascination ghetto culture so predominant early 90 . this provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement some new challenges player conquer . new grand theft auto concept territory control , member street gang player opportunity take over every available territory los santos later game . perhaps most notable additions franchise ability customize your character appearance improve his varied skills throughout game . these may seem like rather superficial additions but they surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly . character skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes freeform exploration players come expect series . customization your avatar varies greatly encompasses most fashion styles found during early `90s california . lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits , expensive jewelry trendy fashions . your characters appearance varied you want it it not stop just clothes tattoos , his physical fitness also changed . grand theft auto franchise improved almost all aspects each subsequent release this one proves no different . last game series use this outdated engine it pushes it far it go terms graphical prowess . graphics slightly improved over previous installment but they remain sub par standard featured most games released around same time . nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint game color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture . soundtrack aptly replicates time period which san andreas draws its visual style perhaps one complaint this subject would rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music . expected genres found , such hip-hop alternative rock , both which strong presence early nineties pop scene . however , some stations seem oddly out place game world era . dance music funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it , although too much choice never bad thing . making welcomed return various radio station djs , who each pepper time tracks hilarious chat amusing observations . those would prefer listen nothing but banter there two radio stations talk radio format , one public station holding discussions day political events light talk shows . either one these stations more than enough keep player amused hours but just case pc version gives you added bonus playing your own mp3 tracks adding them game music library . sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive . there usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists you pull them out their vehicle run off their ride . all these things add little bit life game large cities voice work varies enough cover all different geographical areas san andreas contains . thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods all present . gunfire explosions sound average , not much improvement present since vice city . despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself . engrossing action game continues expand its limits while continuing deliver what fans series come expect	1

after finishing both " half life episode i " " chronicles riddick : escape butcher bay " over few days , i looking fun first person shooter game would let me pass away hour or so day , allow me unwind slaughtering constant flow enemies high powered weapons without resulting actual murder innocent people . i'd heard " far cry " pretty good , so i bought it , installed it got ready blas t.t he first thing i noticed astonishing graphics engine . it without doubt most beautiful environment ever created fps . my jaw floor first few hours , checking out ridiculously high detailed environment . outdoor scenery looks like paradise holiday destination crystal clear blue water lush green jungle . there birdlife , fish general feeling you're running around living , breathing world . one thing very different right start would play major role later missions . there no save game option ! there checkpoints littered around levels , but it occasionally around 10 20 minutes solid game-play them . first this just annoyed me since i found myself reloading over over some harder missions . i couldn't just run into fray , firing my weapon left , right centre anything moves because one headshot would send me back heck long way some instances . i forced change my style play all out assault , stealthy , crawling , breath-holding , sweating , nerve wracking approach . i rediscovered part myself loved " thief : dark project " so very much all those years ago . yet i still got combine approach levels general carnage when it simply unavoidable . i am now firm believer save game option should removed many other ( not all ) first person games out there it raises intensity level dramatically . story itself fairly average dialogue even more so , which really what places " far cry " below likes " half life " . you basically just following instructions entire game , used violent killing machine no real choices . but some reason , i just didn't care i so absorbed surroundings simply surviving it didn't lower my enjoyment . enemies very good ai , flanking me whenever possible generally actually trying avoid shot rather than running straight me . there plenty occasions though where enemy just stand there distance while you shoot them plain sight , but generally all good . weapons fantastic both highly effective satisfying use . sniper rifle always personal favourite this game makes awesome use it , massive maps open ground . while initially i prepared standard " serious sam " type game , " far cry " turned out so much more . some fantastic graphics , inspired level design , forced variations play some fiercely intense gunfights make this game absolute winner . you add value money well since there 20 long missions get through . no save option , those 20 take you long time complete . but you love it ! i sure	1
i really enjoy top down side scrolling shooters , so take this opinion mind . only problem r-type dying sucks . when you die you restart usually bad position without any powerups . once you unlock free-play this make game frustrating when you playing new stages or playing different ship etc . however overall i think it best r-types one better side scrollers out there .	1

my television completely different part my house my high speed internet connection , so while i wasn't thrilled dish out extra money this adapter , i say it completely worth it . since i figured out how set up my home wireless network coordinate 360 , i get very strong connection no problems staying connected . only issue i when i first set up adapter i didn't known enough wireless networks everything clicking together . first 360 would access xbox live , but using other nearby wireless networks because i not give 360 password id access my linksys router . i live center city philadelphia , default adapter picking up using whatever open wireless networks available . range must good , because it would register six or seven other networks varying strengths . once i figured out my linksys router password code ( i think it wep number ) i able punch router id into 360 360 then automatically connected secure wireless router my home . i never single issue since . i don't think this delay optimal setup anyone fault but my own , since i pretty ignorant how wireless networks set up but i feeling it may happen others . all all , i think secure wireless network home what become standard next few years . this adapter works great , small disappears behind console , reduces clutter wires , allows you keep your computer high speed connection separate distinct your television area . it definitely worthy purchase	1

castlevania : curse darkness game even die-hard castlevania fan might not much get into . lament innocence wasn't terrible game , but it wasn't great . curse darkness just goes show when 3d castlevania game marches forth , it problems . sometimes scary problems . like lament innocence , it so much potential good -- this title more so . but it doesn't deliver , that sad revelation admit , especially after so much enjoyment ds smash : dawn sorrow . ever since 1997 all time best , symphony night , so many main characters series like alucard some way . hector curse darkness no exception . he looks little like alucard . but we're not here discuss . hector devil forgemaster , one who given up his powers . dracula dead , but land overun curse monsters world valachia . hector , however , isn't concerned what kind shape world . he more concerned evil devil forgemaster name issac , who killed his beloved . if you couldn't guess , it time revenge . so issac leads hector into place full traps obstacles he must overcome . doing so , hector slowly recover his devil forgemaster skills whatnot . story actually unfolds excellent voice-acting , but there isn't much story . since symphony night we've given this metroid style exploration when it comes castlevania . this marvelous , once again , makes its way into 3d world castlevania . you explore large castle riddled goodies . this includes weapons , subweapons , armor much more . playing game quite fun . most game , you might guessed , spent running through endless hallways defeating monsters . isn't boring you might think . you perform some cool looking combos enemies , but each one must finished button . you also lock onto enemies perform combos . this makes camera go crazy , though , but this forgiveable . battling without locking actually much better , it isn't too hard without . although , if you want steal your enemies , you'll lcok ' em . speaking stealing , it nice you actually . many time monster leave himself open stealing . this usually occurs while it recovers taking damage . again , you must locked it happen . likewise , unlike lament innocence , they actually use level up system . other words , there actually point battling through hordes monsters this time . you also little helper monsters . you compare them familiars found other castlevania games ( like symphony night dawn sorror ) , but better comparison would pokemon . they lend their assistance gain experience defeating enemies , just you . it nice not go it alone , but we castlevania veterans would prefer go it alone . each enemy also drops evolution crystals . collect enough them your monster evolve . you won't grow like them , though . that sad part , they don't really enhance gameplay . monsters special abilities , though . golem like creatures open heavy doors , imps let you bury underground . but you can't help but admit it would nice if your little innocent devils actually characters . also , no evolution crystal same . you take advantage system collecting different types crystals seeing how your little buddies evolve . one nice things devil forger , you make your own weapons ! hector it any time he wants ! that right , no running back some stupid shop it ! monsters often drop raw materials , you use them make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger . you this simply opening menu . i don't know you , but that pretty satisfying me able tha t.t he weapons their own little downside however . exception sword , none them highly helpful combat . you start game off short sword , you'll grow accustomed its fast speed easy use . other weapons just aren't fast enough , enemies aren't weak certain weapon " type " . this makes weapon crafting system little useless some points . unless you're person who likes use " cool " looking weapons opposed swift powerful weapons , you won't much use weapon crafting system , except power up your sword . thus , experimenting weapons garners no fun . it pretty cool , i must say , venturing somewhere isn't dracula castle . instead you actually venture through world valachia . meaning you'll trek through swamps , mountains , valleys lot more . so if you're tired dracula castle , this quite change . problem this " world " you don't see enough it . there not enough detail it . you follow beaten path ( so it isn't really different than dracula castle lament innocence ) , so you can't go off just explore places you're . game also suffers what lament innocence suffered : lack detailed enviroments . you'll no doubt run down same path/hall/corridor several times over . if it weren't map you'd find yourself lost , thinking you must one those " looping " ares , or you took wrong turn ended up running circle . monsters also not so great . what i love 2d castlevania games ( especially new dawn sorrow ) how much variety thrown into monsters . attacks they use you . even if they're same looking monster , they throw some new attack you don't expect . curse darkness ( like lament innocence ) no variety . you'll run into same batch monsters constantly , they'll never something new . later game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates different colored monsters nothing new . likewise , all monsters you'll ever see encountered pretty early . moment you run into axe armor , you've run into ' em all ! they'll never change . i sound like i'm picky enemies thing , but i'm not . it takes away challenge game . fact reincarnates don't anything new makes it more true . that not worst part : game overall just isn't challenge . bosses , times , but if you've playing 3d action games , i think you'll find even more challenging bosses no challenge all . early boss battles game fairly easy . later , however , they get start get hard , that when battling them actually becomes fun . again , though , if you're action/adventure pro , you'll probably beat most them your first try . i wish i could say graphics great . hey , hector looks great combat . but enviroments don't enough detail . too many them simple everyday enviroments we've seeing long time now . where detail ? you know ... like ... maybe leaves tree moving ? we're point where there could some kind interation enviroment , instead it seeming like we're running through still-life painting . visually , it doesn't look half bad . it just there could so much more . bosses look cool , framerate doesn't slow down all , but there isn't enough variety , or detail . however , i must say this : music sounds aweseome ! usual , castlevania games some best music there heard gaming ! it better than symphony night ? no , it not . it isn't better than lament innocence either ( which also steller music ) , but it still among best you'll ever hear video game . likewise , voice acting actually really really good ! i just wish i could've heard more it ! curse darkness potential good game . but there lot things keep it down . it fairly fun game play , but it lacks innovation . you won't able separate it other action/adventure 3d games . it got nothing makes it stick out . if you must this game , however , i'd say wait price drop . if you're really looking good castlevania game , i'd suggest getting hold " dawn sorrow " . it much better game . good : +great music ! some best gaming ! +good weapon system+it pretty fun play+you steal enemies ! +great voice acting ! bad-little innovation-lack cutscenes advance story-too much game gets recycled too fas t-t oo easy-the game doesn't look bad , but there little imagination environments-not whole lot different enemies-it too easy-boring level designs ( not enough them)-you just can't help game almost no innovation ! it no different than your average action/adventure 3d gameget dawn sorrow , or one other 2d versions game . they seem fare so much better than this one . even die-hard fan castlevania admit this one rather bland	1

computer games bad reputation : they're violent , mindless , escapist , blah , blah , blah . mostly , reputation well-deserved ; computer games entertainment , , such , they're designed take our minds off " real " world while . what wrong ? simcity 4 not typical computer game . you need no coordination all , you don't need accept any fantasy world , there no one shoot ( or anything shoot , either ) , there no mazes run , so . what there ability see " real " world , but way you want it , rather than it . one form or , simcity around many years . this version part its continual evolution . i've owned two earlier versions , i found this one best yet terms features operation . it works way its supposed . side benefit simcity its long history allowed huge on-line community develop . there hundreds sites offering chat , help issues , templates cities , etc . you certainly don't need these sites make full use game out box , but they there . one most interesting things simcity way it demonstrates education entertainment aren't mutually exclusive . you play , you forced come terms issues like relationship tax rates business growth ; parks , citizen satisfaction , public works budgets ; pollution economic development ; etc . however , none these lessons explicit ; they just dawn you you play , because you see consequences your decisions . i heard very young kids understand appreciate these issues after short time playing . i tend measure entertainment value terms fun per unit money . regard , simcity 4 outstanding entertainment value . i've liked past iterations game , i like this one even better , i'll almost certainly buy next version , too	1

no solo para los rpg fans -------------------------- se que hay muchos que no gustan de los rpg , de hecho yo mismo no soy fan de estos . asi que al empezar jugar oblivion lo hice solo por curiosidad , por probar que tan buenas eran las graficas el gameplay . al principio no me pareci� gran cosa ... pero cuando sales la primera vez campo abierto ... incre�ble ! te quita el aliento . una vez empiezas recorrer todo el reino de tamriel el juego te atrapa cr�anme no puedes esperar el momento de regresar seguir explorando este gigantesco mundo lleno de secretos maravillas . cuando pienses en oblivion , no imagines un juego tipo las final fantasy , o los t�picos rpg japoneses , este es un rpg que apela un publico mucho m�s amplio . aquellos que gustan de juegos como zelda , o aventuras como enclave , incluso los fans de los juegos de sigilo como splinter cell , encontraran aqu� algo para ellos . camino la gloria ---------------------- es4 : oblivion te coloca en el rol de un prisionero , que por alguna raz�n , fuiste parte de un sue�o del emperador uriel septim en el cual tu eras el elegido para salvar tamriel de un oscuro grupo daedra conocido como mythic dawn . de esta forma empiezas vagar por las catacumbas ayudando los guardias proteger al emperador , sin embargo el emperador es asesinado tu eres la unica esperanza de detener este culto cerrar las puertas de oblivion as� detener la invasi�n de los daedra tamriel . es en esta parte donde empiezas la personalizaci�n de tu personaje , que habilidades deseas , cuales ser�n tus fortalezas debilidades . dependiendo te tus elecciones , podr�s ser un guerrero , un mago , un sigiloso ladron asi como pertenecer cualquier raza que desees . conforme avanza el juego debes ir haciendo crecer tus habilidades para poder ganar experiencia . �como hacerlo ? eso depende del tipo de personaje que escogiste , hay toda una gama de habilidades desarrollar . empaca tus cosas --------------------- oblivion posee infinidad de misiones realizar ( aproximadamente 500 horas de juego ) , claro esta , hay una misi�n principal que es encontrar al heredero del emperador cerrar la puertas de oblivion , sin embargo , si as� lo deseas , puedes ignorarla tomar otras b�squedas como unirte la hermandad de los magos � la de los luchadores , pelear en la arena , ganar fama fortuna o simplemente explorar ayudar los diferentes habitantes de tamriel en sus vidas diarias . cuando hablamos de juegos donde puedes hacer lo que quieras , ahora estaremos hablando de oblivion . el reino de tamriel es enorme , hay muchas ciudades que visitar cada una tan diferente de la otra , los personajes parecen tener vida propia , sus problemas , discusiones , mitos , etc . ademas de los pueblos encontraras infinidad de aldeas mazmorras donde , explor�ndolas , descubrir�s toda clase de items que te ayudar�n completar las tareas que hayas escogido . lo bueno , lo malo lo caro ----------------------- en el apartado grafico oblivion realmente te quita el aliento , los paisajes , las monta�as los bosques son simplemente impresionantes . los �rboles se mueven con el viento , igual que el follaje . los atardeceres amaneceres son simplemente espectaculares , esto agregado que puedes explorar cualquier parte de este gigantesco mundo es lo que hace oblivion ser una experiencia sobrecogedora de principio fin ( si es que hay fin ... ) . sin embargo un juego tan gigantesco como este no esta libre de problemas , de vez en cuento encontraras ciertos bugs , como tu caballo flotando misteriosamente sobre una roca , etc . sin embargo son nada ante lo que le juego ofrece . lo caro , todo tiene un precio , si realmente quieres apreciar este juego en toda su magnificencia necesitas una pc relativamente potente . aunque hay un parche para pc no muy potentes . shut jaws oblivion ! --------------------------- oblivion es uno de los principales contendientes para juego del a�o , asi que no te lo pierdas es un juego fant�stico . si estas pensando que hacer estas vacaciones te recomiendo un viaje tamriel cr�anme ser�n unas vacaciones que nunca olvidaras ...	1
might little misleading -- battle mechanics almost exactly same those first game ( heck , most nippon ichi games , though this series , i think , best lot ) . part game absolutely delivers : - great classes . - good monsters , more consistent class sytem them . - excellent assortment items . - good variety levels . however , far story -- area which hour darkness solid -- this game falls its face . writing iffy , plot itself contrived , characters ( while certainly amusing ) predictable , it just leaves so much desired . if you're looking storyline you get involved , go back first game . if you're it gameplay , though , don't miss this one ! some class tweaks few added features , cursed memories worthy addition those who simply want monotonous level-up madness some us thrive . great 2d art mixed fun environments , hilarious quips item descriptions , engaging fights hundreds hours ( literally ) entertainment	1

fable much anticipated rpg promised 40-50 hours gamer action storyline complete control over life protagonist . we waited this game what seemed like lifetime build up game finally arrive almost more than rpg lovers could take , but it live up hype ? no , my fellow gamers . it hurts me so say it . while game promised deliver several hours stoyline play i shocked when i completed main storyline less than 20 hours . now , i'm not one doubt sacred words lionhead studios , so i dedicated 20 hours my life uncover different aspects gameplay , such getting married , changing outfits body types , becoming divinely evil or majestically good ( ect . ) , but it all just so linear ! paths set , storyline already thought out , character chosen , you weren't given enough keep interest going . i later dragged myself back game play storyline through again , though i admit i enjoyed game much more second time through , i just found myself not caring it all . too many options closed darn story just too short !! darker elements game simply addicting such colleseum , prison ( which i played over over over ) , story your sister , but it seems though people charge developing such side stories ( which we all so love !!! ) got little case a.d.d. now , i'm not saying avoid this game . it got just what some gamers may need get into rpg , but those us who expecting game completely pwn morrowind , well , let just move ... or wait better thought our sequal . * crosses fingers	1

i played through first halo really enjoyed single-player campaign . i never played multiplayer game until i bought halo 2 . let get this out way first : halo 2 multiplayer unparalleled . multitude multiplayer games ( capture flag , juggernaut , team vs . team , etc . ) dizzying variety terrains , there plenty keep halo fans busy blowing each other up . addition alien elites playable character spice things up . you also wield two weapons time , one each fist , providing combat option those gunslingers like their battles john woo-style . unfortunately , halo 2 single-player campaign not impressive . whit , alien covenant entire society based idea activating giant rings throughout universe ( known halos ) put them their journey spiritual evolution . reality halo weapon designed destroy flood , infestation aliens who turn human alien alike into vicious zombies . how you keep flood infecting every living thing ? why , utterly destroying every living thing universe course ! play alternates master chief alien elite known arbiter . this gives player both sides story , which interesting ... point . eventually , plot converges enough so two characters should really end up fighting each other . would something , if ai made you play through both battles opposite sides creating enemy uses your own moves . but instead , midway through battle universe , giant plant looks like audrey ii little shop horrors shows up . this planet , speaking jabba-esque guttural tones , rams plot down our throats grabbing arbiter master chief shoving them into opposite plot lines : arbiter ends up working humans , master chief ends up doing alien dirty work . then things really get going , just halo 2 hurtles towards final battle earth ... game ends . i should guessed something up when , during e3 interviews halo 3 , ceo bungee only this say : " you ready finish war ? " what he meant , " you ready finish game you thought you finishing halo 2 ? " you've probably noticed my review second installment pirates caribbean , i really , really , really hate movies games fail provide whole story . it doesn't matter this part two three-part series . writers developers obligation provide full story ; you create story beginning end even though it middle series , evidenced two towers . halo 2 improvement original , but it loses points weak campaign forces you play both sides , then throws talking plant clean up mess .	1
if you always wanted turn based strategy game fantasy setting no limits then dominions ii really only option out there . its not perferct but its darn good . story , if you really call it , world dominions once one god . one day he just wasn't there all sudden everybody their brother decided try apply his job . all these " pretender gods " kill off all other gods put their religions out commision order take over world become true god . start up new game dominions ii you need choose one 17 different empires then pick your pretender god dozens different avatars . you play darn near anything you imagine ordinary , like arch-mage , outrageously exotic , like fountain blood . every pretender god strengths weaknesses some may adept only one or two paths magic while others may learn many ease . you also pick castle set up your own " dominion " which effect your god his followers his religion spreads across world . but isn't all , you still haven't actually started game yet . next you create game picking one nearly dozen huge maps setting all game settings such victory conditions difficulty neutral provinces . lets not forget , you also choose which 17 empires playing if they human or ai players . game itself huge very few limits . your empires unique units may built any province which you built castle but every proince game also its own units may built there inculde many none empires usually access . plus units may equiped different armor weapons such there may well hundreds unique units game maybe even thousands different equipment varaitions . like pretender gods , units come huge array simple , like light infantry , wild , like werewoles vampires . combine fact there hundreds spells game research , hundreds magic items forge find , random events almost every turn , no two games ever end same way game nearly unlimited replyability . combat bit unsual . all units , order move around map or attack , assigned commander . commanders built same way you recruit normal units but they only lead so many men . however , you assign units under commander many squads you like each squad well commander himself issued specific order such casting spells , using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes battle field . downside all this you set up all this before hand during your turn . combat occours turns you no control over battle . its entirely up your units follow plan you laid out them . better or worse this system certainly original . but some things game really bother me . my biggest complaint game computer ai . its not thats its too stupid or too smart . its actually bit like terminator , it allways seems know where you sends wave after wave seemingly endless foes after you . it can't reasoned , it can't bargined it won't stop until one you dead . no diplomacy options units like spys , assassins scouts extremely rare expensive most games aginst ai just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks huge armies killing each other over over gods throwing spells each other turn after turn . problem game manual which huge but contains no information isn't easily available game . its same problem evil genius , manual awful all hints should hae manual hidden games loading screens . i hope you read fast . grapics obviously aren't exactly par half life 2 or doom 3 but they work , however i've got take issue music sound which downright awful . you better get used hearing same three music tracks over over . over all , dominions ii far best turn based fantasy game i've ever played . room improvement obviously here but this game should keep you occupied long time	1
i've fan prince persia series since i little kid . pop 1 great , pop 2 absolutely unreal . pop 3d ehhh .... but then two years ago , came game changed everything . " prince persia sands time , " first game this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone breath away . gameplay original , flawless , beautiful . storyline sucked you didn't let you go even after you'd beaten it 6 times over . it flawless game . last year , first sequel , " prince persia warrior within , " released . while game contained improvements quality graphics " freeform fighting " techniques , game less pleasing both critics gamers . ubisoft turned humrous , witty , intelligent prince " sands " into angry , nu-metal-rocking , humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent ruining everyone time . while story equally engaging " sands , " " warrior " failed because it simply not much fun play . luckily , ubisoft saved best last . " two thrones " easily one greatest games i ever played . concluding one greatet videogame trilogies ever created , ubisoft developed near flawless game . it though they took strengths both games , removed weaknesses second game , created thing pure brilliance . " two thrones " contains all witty , punning elements first game mixes them exciting , more violent elements second game while removing everying ruined prince demeanor second game . original , fun , saracastic prince back , largely because ubisoft also brought back one things made " sands " so great : farrah . farrah perfect foil our hero . she adds humor , power , creativity , definitely sexiness game " warrior " lacking . farrah relationship prince far my favorite relationship i've ever " played " videogame ubisoft deserves big brownie points bringing her back . gameplay " two thrones " amazing . throughout game , gamer occassionally forced play " dark prince " there situations where " normal , " original prince unable get through . other games , playing two characters often appeared more gimmick than actual , integral part story , but " two thrones , " reasoning behind prince frequent changing prince dark prince back again very well explained very important overall story " two thrones telling . " fight scenes epicly fun play . this prince more moves than he two last games combined his battle techniques joy use . new " speed kill " method killing some opponents adds certain amount skill brutality many fights otherwise would seemed boring taken far too long complete . i welcomed addition speed kills once i fully learned how use them . prince still moves acrobatically ever . there still wall-running , jumping , flipping , handsprings , etc .... only real notable movement difference when gamer plays dark prince . dark prince chain/weapon/thing used grab onto bars away or objects would otherwise out reach prince then swing over them . it not different anything prince before but it definitely fun worked well flow game . all all i rate this best new sands pop trilogy . it awesome game should played anyone who ever enjoyed 3rd person adventure game . if you haven't played either one first two games warned : storyline actually rather complex you missing much story if you haven't played first two games . if you played first two games , this story terrific conclusion prince tale , way it wraps around back beginning trilogy floored me when i finished it . buy this game . ( something worth noting ... after you beat game you unlock many videos , chief among these " alternate/real ending " warrior within formerly only available if you beat warrior after collecting all life upgrades .... so if you beat warrior without all life upgrades didn't see " real " ending ... beating this game shows it you video collection )	1

i very much enjoyed this game i think it may my favorite x-box game i own ! i kinda agree person said this game pretty short , but it not make it any less better ! one funny part this game part where you sunny first time game jump each pipe whole time she just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game people like games fun , educational , very durable	1
simply put , xenogears + xenosaga 1 absolute best storyline , best role playing experience ps2 date . i strongly believe xenosaga 2 best storyline any rpg i ever , ever played , including final fantasy 7 , xenogears , hundreds others . because rpgs strongly reliant storyline gameplay , i consider this pinnacle role playing ps2 . final fantasy comes close , star ocean , but terms storyline , this game beats them . however , i mark down few other minor flaws . this game highly niche game , only those who enjoy style , sci fi setting . it also very short ..... 20 hours if you play straight through ( no leveling up ) . maybe 38-42 hours if you take up side-quests want strong character . gameplay : first xenosaga highly relied cut scenes narrative . fact , i absolutely could not stand battle system . xenosaga episode 2 still relies heavily upon storytelling through hours cut scenes , but it fixes battle system . battle system , simply put , one most fun turn-based systems i ever experienced . while xenosaga episode 1 battle system seemed slow unwieldy , episode 2 fast paced , action packed , highly challenging battle system . you 3 characters screen just all times , these characters switched off manner much like ffx , but it costs turn this game , causing it more tactical . each turn you many options ; you attack ( more various attacks later ) , stock ( save turn next turn order get combo ) , use ether ( read : magic ) , or change your battle party . if you choose attack , there whole slew options here well . most importantly learning weak points enemy . every enemy , including bosses , certain attack combination most effective against them . when you attack , you press either square , which zone attack , triangle , which zone attack , or circle , which zone attack . certain characters also zone attack , but this only against flying opponents . you must expierament enemies order learn zones they weakest . sometimes , you may required ' stock ' turn order attack enemy its weak zone . " what advantage attacking weak zones ? " you ask . well , it allows large scale , damage pounding comboes absolutely essential this game . once you hit all enemy weak zones , you " break " them . this involves circle button . once character ' broken ' , they tossed into air , or attacked while prone ground . this add up tons damage if you plan your boosting right . boosting integral part combat system . pressing r1 button brings up 3 slot meter which sometimes empty , but it may feature character potraits some your characters . if you press r1 , then button ( square , triangle , or circle ) character potrait , they boost forward , immediately after acting unit taken its turn , this new character turn . enemies , however , take advantage all these systems well . if you not plan well , or randomly attack without comboes , enemy break you , boost ahead several times , easily destroy one your characters one short , brutal assault . countless times my entire party destroyed simple enemies should no problem , merely because i not plan ahead . you get very , very used seeing game over screen . plus side this difficulty you feel real exhiliration when you win , it great accomplishment . note even power levelling , it won't help you much some situations , believe me , i tried . finally , there ether . ether skills basically magic , if you know anything rpgs all , then you know basically what present here , healing ether skills , attack ether skills , nothing big . i forgot mention e.s. units . these basically mechs , called a.g.w.s. episode 1 . many points game involve you using these move around fight , now they independant battle system . it basically same one your characters screen , except you only one attack turn , no comboes or anything like . it just added piece fun already awesome game . there skill system place . after every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points . these spent getting new ether skills , or new upgrades your characters make them more resilient when you equip them . every character same skill set , this minor flaw slightly brings down gameplay score , but not overall enjoyment least . finally , one other flaw gameplay there no weapons , no armor . both these rpg standard fare , it seems kind odd not either . this may just something developers decided not i disagree , but it still seems little odd . note this really not detract game any way . xenosaga 2 , they also opted add lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 . interesting thing these puzzles , while challenging , don't take away gameplay expierience all . fact , i found many very enjoyable . storyline this game simply incredible . but , keep mind it basically required you beaten xenosaga episode 1 if you want understand it all , or least acquainted story some manner . if you haven't played it , best way get bonus dvd came game , there probably some somewhere around , maybe even ebay , allows you see 4 hours cut scenes original . this substitute those who dont want spend 60-80 hours required xenosaga episode 1 beat it . anyway , i digress , xenosaga 2 storyline more space opera fun . often times i got very emotional , game tug your heartstrings . ending sequence game , spectacular event lasting 15 minutes , i seriously tears . this game you , storyline good . it also filled entrigue , betrayal , new discoveries , new secrets . it truly incredible . i seen certain reviews say storyline doesn't solve everything , it doesn't solve all mysteries . let me tell you something : it not supposed . xenosaga going 4-8 part series , storyline continuous . it makes no sense all story complete only episode ii . i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain it . graphics : graphics xenosaga 2 basically same they episode 1 . no real improvements all . they still great though , cut scenes gorgeous . my one real complaint here lip sync sometimes off ( problem just every rpg voice overs ) , some environments little dull . this made up environments simply breathtaking . sound : soundtrack xenosaga episode 2 godlike . opening theme battle music catchy japanese sounding tunes ring your head forever , this music incredible . voice acting also absolutely superb , i zero complaints , this rarity . sound effects also very appropriate , very well . value : game hurt value department only because its length . put it perspective , first playthrough took me 28 hours , but more like 30 if you count all times i died go back point i got killed . after you win , you use your game clear file access even more goodies like some bonus bosses , dungeons , side quests , this helps make up shorter length . personally , i think its best $50 i ever spen t.t ilt : finally , overall enjoyment . this game simply most enjoyable game i played ps2 . i completed it after several all-night gaming sessions , it most likely keep you up too . role playing experience here superb , storyline possibly best rpg history , battle system incredible depth . there virtually nothing not like . avid rpg gamer , i recommend this game highly possible . however , there few things consider : you handle challenge , you like space opera/anime feel ? if you answered yes both , get this game	1
i find this game very indepth when it comes ability change formations plays just what you see . however , my major disappointment comes graphics . i understand ps2 doesn't not standards xbox360 , but this false advertising showing this very detailed game not showing which system this ran . i just hope when ps3 comes out , madden rerelease game it give xbox360 owners something whine . ea should more infomational giving what things look like consumer rather then just showing best picture they	1
admittedly , i haven't played lot strategy rpgs . i attempted play final fantasy tactics , generally considered classic genre , one point , but i found it really dry i serious problems class system seems really unbalance game making it too easy . i've never really much motivation seek out other examples srpg genre because there nippon-ichi disgaea series , unique it fun . long-lasting too . you spend several hundred hours playing through disgaea : hour darkness disgaea 2 : cursed memories beat all bonus content beyond main campaign . disgaea 2 shines more polished version first disgaea . character sprites more vivid , spell effects more visual flare . music dialogue sharper audio quality . all bonus quests first disgaea expanded such inclusion dark court endless dungeon item world even more stuff dark assembly . however , it also so similar first game it feels almost like expansion pack rather than true sequel . story disgaea 2 similar first one , it highly character driven told quite bit humor . overlord zenon tranformed all residents world veldime into monsters . adell , last remaining human , embacks quest slay overlord rozalin , zenon haughty neglected daughter . way , they meet colorful cast enemies , rivals , allies they attempt crack mystery behind near-immortal zenon . it enjoyable story , if bit meandering . it one major susprise twist end caught me off guard though it probably shouldn't . combat , like most srpgs , takes place series grid-like maps , usually four chapter . characters move around so many squares per turn opportunity attack any enemies falls within their attack range . battlefields littered geo-panels , multicolored pyramids confer penalties bonuses certain areas maps . there dozens classes , both monster human , fashion powerful army out . choose wisely , because grand total 10 deployed any one time . unfortunately , experience points only go character deals final blow so level disparities characters combined steadily increasing difficulty curve make it neccesary replay some maps times . luckily , difficulty curve much more finely tuned this game , so you spend less time leveling up than first game . main campaign disgaea 2 pretty short , i clocked little over 30 hours my first play through , granted i barely touched much sidequests . i also found it little easy side . i didn't die once until i penultimate chapter . i don't know it because game easier or if it just spending over one hundred hours conquering first game . sprgs probably hardest sub-set out rpg genre . disgaea series highly recommended experienced inexperienced players alike . disgaea 2 many different systems enhance playing experience , but unlike many games , doesn't force player learn how work them all . players option playing game face value or learning all complex systems more enriched experience . this very accessable game , this genre definitely needs more games strike balance too hard or too easy .	1
i think this might one my favorites ff series . i think all characters awesome . their overdrives very cool too	1

one thing kotor 2 greatly impressed me how obsidian , taking kotor franchise over bioware , not mess winning formula . they faithfully carried over first game visual style , presentation , atmosphere , which means those who played kotor 1 jump right . just like kotor 1 , game hinges its story rather than fancy gimmicks or better graphics or more features . kotor 2 storyline runs parallel kotor 1 , introduces new protagonist whose only tie first game he/she fought mandalorian wars . again , characters bit flat/stereotypical , most talking throughout game ( you mostly choose how you'll respond others through your dialogue choices ) . main reason why i would actually rate this game higher - yes , higher - than kotor 1 intelligence script . what i mean how game characters challenge you ( both main character person playing game ) think long hard some things regarded " truths . " yes , i'm talking some serious philosophy here . example , kreia , one your allies , challenges you think how random act kindness actually robs person that helped chance struggle , fight , become stronger it . jedi master challenge you think what if cause you believed strongly ends up doing just much harm it prevents . instance game shows dangers both blind allegiance independent thought ( yes , latter also dangers ) . best part all this presented within context game various scenarios , without ever sounding preachy . far gameplay mechanics concerned , obsidian spiced up battle interface new force powers feats , which open up new dimension strategizing outfitting your party . unfortunately it seems all bugs glitches first game carried over well , such " doorway bug " " menu bug . " playing pazaak still just hard . nod those who played first game , obsidian decided insert many references kotor 1 here there . example , kotor 2 recycles two planets first game , dantooine korriban . maps identical ones first game , but this time you explore slightly different parts planets . people game constantly referring mandalorian wars ( war fought five years before kotor 1 timeline ) jedi civil war ( events kotor 1 ) . fact , you'll find jedi civil war casts very large shadow over lives many people you'll encounter game , including most your allies . you'll find played first game certainly enriches this one , although it not crucial . so , summary , if you're suffering post-kotor withdrawal symptoms , your prayer answered - go buy this game now	1
i enjoyed most aspects this game it quickly becaming addicting . there great satisfaction beating people up plenty opportunity fine tune my skills . overall though , this game definately easy side . compared grand theft auto games , which i never able complete , i finished this one just over week . final challenge particularly simple i really expected more . still , i'd recommened this game , however rent it , don't buy	1
xbox version this game way better . one , graphics enhanced , not crappy like ps2 version . second all loading time processing time literally cut half . so dont buy this version , suck it up buy xbox . oh if this game bores you , you either weren't using cheats or u havent played missions atleast through los santos	1
i owned xbox over 3 years now it really best gaming machine last generation . mine worked perfectly , i love music soundtracks where you load your own cds unto hard drive play them instead certian game sountracks . game selection much better xbox graphics . you get halo , project gotham racing 2 , midtown madness 3 ( must fun game ) , xbox live . i used my xbox play dvds media center extender ( purchase $25 kit comes remote ) it works well , no fumbling your controller like ps2 , just simple remote !	1
i recently picked this game up because laptop i purchased college finally computer powerful enough run it . it easily one best computer games i've ever played . playing world massive ( you literally walk any mountain or monument you see distance ) there multiple ways accomplish goal and/or solve mission . basic plot this : you jack carver , who accompanied woman part micronesia undisclosed reasons ( she turns out cia agent ) , before long she kidnapped , you fighting your life against army well-trained mercenaries . it fairly generic shooter plot , but it gets point across ties everything together well . enemy ai unbelievably good . soldiers work together take you down ( all while dropping hilariously bad one-liners like " how you like those apples ?? " , " right eyes , mofo ! " , " i'm gonna tear you new one !! " ) . shootouts result this game blast : you really get good cover strategize your fight . it first shooter i've played makes me feel like i'm actually action movie . vehicles one game biggest highlights . if you want move quicker downstream , you snipe occupants frequent patrol boats water steal their ride . you often obtain rvs atvs ( one point game , forklift reasons unknown ) . these blast you drive right through enemies firing you . one thing i enjoy doing driving full speed enemy bailing out last second . always good fun . game also great challenge . i just completed game medium setting it still almost impossible places . fighting trigens ( small monkey-like creatures claws ) nightmare any diffculty , they outrun outjump you kill you , often , single hit ( i strongly suggest using sniper rifle or powerful machine gun other than m4 them long distance before they really mess you up ! )in short , this best fps i ever played , probably one best computer games ever made overall . highly recommended . ( side note : not it matters me , but i'm personally surprised this game got mature rating ... there barely any blood all , none it sticks floor . when shot rocket launcher , people don't explode like normally mature-rated shooters . this game should rated teen )	1
this particularly good game our younger kids , though our 9 year old able finish entire game weekend . our 7 year old continues enjoy it without same degree frustration he experiences some other games bit too old him . this game great even though kids not seen movie	1
i just bought this game last month , played all way through it , including unlockable side quests . i'm not going write much games story here , there plenty other reviews already . all i'm going write game itself . anyway , after playing all way through game , i say i like it even more than original . script much better , music sounds much better gba . one thing i particularly liked this game all new unlockables ! after beating game , you unlock new dungeon explore , well really cool music player ! if you go down extra select " music player " main menu , you listen all tunes melodies you heard throughout game ! my personal favorites include , hey cid !, rydia , theme love , chocobo-chocobo , dancing calcobrena . unlockable dungeon , lunar ruins , very cool ! fully unlock every room dungeon , you beat zeromus once each character . after , you get some really cool extra tasks each character ! i wont spoil them you , but just them game highly increases overall replay value this game . now pros cons this remake ... pros:it same old game you used love , but some cool upgrades additions game play . new quick save feature allows you save inside dugeons towns . some text old game fixed so now all magic spells aren't abreviated . example : meteo fixed read meteor . new unlockable music player side quest dungeon ! music sounds much sharper gba , you really hear seperate instruments playing unison . this version old , unedited script , which far more convincing durring game play . cons : unlike final fantasy chronicles , this game not include chrono trigger . they changed sound effects some moves , changed names some moves . example , meteor doesnt make screechy noise anymore , ( which i thought sounded cool ) nuke changed flare . battle , there seems lag reaction time when pressing down buttons ... ( you press button , but it takes second register command . ) 50/50 : none graphics upgraded , but if you're like me , doesnt really matter . if you're like me , already played final fantasy ii snes or final fantasy chronicles psone , buy this game ! it well worth price	1
if you " mechassault " xbox live gamer tag try playing me ! i usually play capture flag my gamer tag " minor00 " so if you see me sure challenge me game because this game rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
scarface world yours ( vivendi games ) one most hyped videos games 2006 . following success godfather game , people couldn't wait get their hands scarface game especially when some reviewers said it good or better than grand theft auto games . game takes what if scenario , i.e. , what if tony montana didn't die end scarface but instead loses everything rebuild his empire . first i start off important matter -- player control movement . comparison past vivendi/universal games i say player control movement very good . next up weapons . i personally felt like aim shooting ability could vastly improved . according tutorial you press l1 target r1 shoot but they failed mention you must use analog stick aim your weapon . maybe you don't , maybe it just me , this isn't instructions but i found more success when i used analog stick conjunction l1 r1 . game begins you your mansion facing hail gunfire enemies . top your balcony you must shoot enemies . then came my first moment " oh this isn't much free world grand theft auto , " when i tried descend left side staircase i couldn't get down it . it like there invisible forcefield . perhaps you need kill certain amount enemies before you descend down left stairs . i made my kills then descended down right side staircase take remainder enemies . there function named blind rage comes out when you press button controller . this function makes tony temporarily invincible . when he dies , screen it says " you f*cked up . " just one example cursing game . word used so much this game adult i wish there would filter change language setting . i literally play game mute because all foul language . scarface-the world yours fun game if you like violent games . i point out gamer rock star games spoiled us terribly . scarface-the world yours you pretty much stay mission or there isn't much . past five years grand theft auto series given us ability perform street races , visit shooting range , import vehicles , gamble , dance , work out , or just walk around mess things up when we aren't mission . scarface-the world yours you basically stay mission . there isn't too much extra when you aren't mission . sometimes game player i get tired shooting so much just want take break something different . i strongly suggest buying prima games strategy guide . it definitely unlocks full potential game . scarface-the world yours overall fun game , but it still doesn't give game player total free open world experience some gta games . but yeah , get strategy guide , it gives player something look forward .	1
plz stop doing reviews over how bad it few options , cuz it just simply isn't way . yo fire flaming people catapults or let you creature throw flaming guy middle army so middle army willl fire . you just need creative . think like what happen if i teach my creature pick up army guy set him fire than throw middle thightly builded city . this game many options , but you'll create these options . this wasn't really review but comment other reviews who saying boring dull etc . this game you make it fun your imagination	1

i no longer play video games ( though i recently started back computergames ) but i review this great set . you get two games : fianl fantasy 5 , final fantasy 6 . first , let us look ff5 . ff5 never released states officialy but squaresoft ( now called squareenix ) unleashed it upon us all . it story isn't greatest but it not story here ; it all gameplay . this main reason this my favourite series . job class indepth gives you lot options here . this improves upon already great job class ff3 ( not ff6 ) only comes insecond job class system found dragon warrior 3 dragon warrior 7 . i also like size if this game , there three different worlds here they all good size . i also love main villian name , x-death , his final form name , neo x-death . there lot more good things make this game great but i'll let you discover them . ff6 also solid game introduced some things would found later ff games . one thing indepth stories multiple characters play . even though lot fans like say ff7 got best villian series , i many others dissagree . kefka jst pure evil incarnate . i'm not going into details so you yourself find all little things make him such awesome bad guy he . it just great game . if you don't mind 2-d graphics , old games , then yourself favoure get this fine set now	1
this great game which yoiu get caught up action . it almost if " you there "	1

unfortunately xenosaga i - der wille zur macht never come europe . but second xenosaga ( jenseits von gut und bse ) released germany november i very happy . so i played it impressed this cool story gameplay ! i became big xenosaga-fan . after i imported first part series america . now i am playing it i must say , first xenosaga much better than second !!!! it great pity xenosaga episode i never brought out germany europa !! you americans should very happy , so many rpgs come your country ^_	1
parents : content this game seems absolutally fine anyone roughly ten up . only reason i see it rated teen because this game requires good bit hand eye cordination sometimes . aslo hulk roaring might get little kids who still around age where they still come up you middle night check there closets monsters , but basicly if your kids handel action cartoons like ninja turtles justice league they deffinately handel this game . anyways ... i wasn't sure this game when i picked it up . i don't know why , i hadn't heard much it i hadn't played many comic book based games besides spiderman based one playstation . but i didn't see many other games rental store kids could play my xbox so i rented it out see if it okay . it , my opinion , absolutaly great game almost anyone . entire game like digital stress ball me , you get rampage your hearts desire . i spent few hours alone week just ignoring story chapters completely just wrecking huge city desert military bases game takes place . kids would also love it same reason they build lego houses then smash them bits their action figures . story bit odd if you don't know much hulk already it revolves around bruces quest cure order stop second more evil cunning hulk bruce banner discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named devil hulk . big green savage hulk we all know love also doesn't like devil hulk moving banner mind , so it becomes more agreeable suconicous orders banner uses get child-like brute what he wants . meanwhile new baddie called abomination appears after one military general stupidly trys recover one bruce failed " cure " attempts very begining game . all all story okay you go , but you tell they tried stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into game story only excuse callenge you bosses other unique situations . far gameplay goes , it fantasic . more damage you cause , more smash points you earn more moves you buy later too continue your assult just everything . there mini games secrets everywhere earn even more smash points . fact , only thing that missing o-o or two player mode . far replayability goes , it always there . anyway , i would recommended this game a)anyone who kids roughly around ten , ) anyone who likes third person , single player games ) anyone one who stress out work one too many times or feels like throwing temper tantrum :)	1

i'm not going into storyline , becuase it obivously spoil it those who haven't oppurtunity play this excellent game . final fantasy first game final fantasy series released playstation 2 . graphics here sharp crisp , no fuzzness or distortions . voice actors actually good job , doesn't sound like those old kung-fu movies where tone voices ] don't match person appearnace . battle system simple use they offer tutorials within menu case you're still confused . i'm really pleased results i see myself playing this game over over again	1

gameplay overall feel this game screams castlevania . sidescrolling platform action spot , graphics truly push limits ds , variety equipment/soul combinations lend itself perfectly creating gameplay experience perfect your style play . people said past reviews , use touch screen feels tacked . defeat bosses you draw symbols screen , which frustrating if ) you poor penmenship , or ) left-handed ( such yours truly ) scramble take stylus out , switch it your other hand , draw symbol . it neat little addition but , again , it didn't really need there . also , boss battles sometimes little too easy , even later levels . don't get me wrong , there some just downright nasty , but some bosses fire off their special weapon all you look screen go " ... that it ? " overall , this great game nintendo ds . exception clunky touch screen addon , game overall fantastic	1

i've gta fan few years now me , san andreas got best one . first time you swim !! i fell into water accidently discovered this new action character . graphics more real making it kind " funky " controlling game but after awhile you'll get used it . language terrible ( more so this gta version ) so young kids should avoid this like plague .	1
when i first played this game i shocked . just how good stealth game could actually . its realistic its ways you hide shadows use enviroment take out your enemies . its really fun also , suspense one main things happens this game . you only use two guns during whole game , pistol rifle attachments . good stuff . all you need , you take out whole building full enemies . you crouch , move slowly so enemy doesnt see you . very realistic game im happy this series games got released . i highly recommend this game . great storyline , last level hecka hard !	1
most starwars games your jedi but this one your clone . i cool . you lead squad around give them orders like attack somthing , blow something up , or even hack computer . unlike other games where your partners aren't much any help this game your squad helps alot . also you don't everything yourself you tell your squad just anything . it also fun beat more than once , it multi player like halo if you don't xbox live . i'm thirteen	1
main appeal grand theft auto franchise always freedom it gives player explore vast amounts territory cause mayhem he sees fit . san andreas contains far most audacious expansion landmass available you . this time action takes place california inspired locales such los santos , san fierro las vegas inspired las venturas , all within enormous state san andreas . main inspiration this time around fascination ghetto culture so predominant early 90 . this provides great opportunity rockstar take advantage setting implement some new challenges player conquer . new grand theft auto concept territory control , member street gang player opportunity take over every available territory los santos later game . perhaps most notable additions franchise ability customize your character appearance improve his varied skills throughout game . these may seem like rather superficial additions but they surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly . character skill growth happens naturally rarely interferes freeform exploration players come expect series . customization your avatar varies greatly encompasses most fashion styles found during early `90s california . lower tier stores offer usual assortment baggy pants sports jerseys while more expensive stores offer suits , expensive jewelry trendy fashions . your characters appearance varied you want it it not stop just clothes tattoos , his physical fitness also changed . grand theft auto franchise improved almost all aspects each subsequent release this one proves no different . last game series use this outdated engine it pushes it far it go terms graphical prowess . graphics slightly improved over previous installment but they remain sub par standard featured most games released around same time . nonetheless visuals quite effective sunsets fill san andreas orange tint game color palette faithfully replicates feel early nineties california culture . soundtrack aptly replicates time period which san andreas draws its visual style perhaps one complaint this subject would rockstar seems try encompass far too many genres music . expected genres found , such hip-hop alternative rock , both which strong presence early nineties pop scene . however , some stations seem oddly out place game world era . dance music funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it , although too much choice never bad thing . making welcomed return various radio station djs , who each pepper time tracks hilarious chat amusing observations . those would prefer listen nothing but banter there two radio stations talk radio format , one public station holding discussions day political events light talk shows . either one these stations more than enough keep player amused hours but just case pc version gives you added bonus playing your own mp3 tracks adding them game music library . sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive . there usual banter among pedestrians complaints motorists you pull them out their vehicle run off their ride . all these things add little bit life game large cities voice work varies enough cover all different geographical areas san andreas contains . thick southern accents countryside inhabitants snobbish tone civilians rich neighborhoods all present . gunfire explosions sound average , not much improvement present since vice city . despite controversy seems follow every release series san andreas praiseworthy title itself . engrossing action game continues expand its limits while continuing deliver what fans series come expect	1
basketball aspect this game little more fun than nba live 2006 just because refs not constantly interupt gmaeplay . but graphic-wise , this game worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003 , i'm talking ps2 version . but close-up graphics very good . my faveorite part game you even fantasy draft play now mode . but if you basketball fan you really should get this , it extremely fun	1
" creature kapu cave " nancy drew hardy boys work together solve mystery surrounding dying pineapple crops hawaii possible relation this top-secret scientific work nearby family who owns vacation excursion center . nancy there working entomologist ( bug scientist ) hardy boys hawaii some detective work family who runs excursion center . locals believe mytholocial creature angered therefore responsible dying crops - they right ? if not , who else could behind it why ? this nd game several new features . first , you go back forth playing both nancy drew hardy boys - each responsible different parts story . also , through use gps you drive wherever you need go . although i thought graphics great , i didn't like fact i couldn't stay any one area very long - once you 1 or 2 things you move place /or identity switch nancy hardy . because this , there wasn't too much explore any one place . overall , i really liked playing " creature kapu cave " - but i would enjoyed it more i able explore each area more wasn't forced move place place so quickly	1
these 2 games probably ( my opinion anyway ) best ones series . i review each game seperatly then make my comments collection itself . ff5 : one previously unreleased ff games ( time anyway ) now america . i really like choosing classes because it raise replay value through roof . i literally trained my characters ( this during beginning middle game ) get level 30 or 40 ( can't remember exactly ) just get my jobs mastered . storyline good well because unlike some other ff games , this one sticks one you need get rid ( x-death ) rather than fighting final battle against someone you no clue what makes character so evil why your fighting him/her instead one who destroying world . bad thing this game lack characters ( there only 5 entire game , you stick 4 , one them dies replaced his granddaughter ) so prepared look same 4 characters screen also not menu change characters . ff6 : i think this best one series . there absolutly no real " main " character this game . those who confused , what i mean , well example , ff7 you 9 characters but leader character cloud ( one you see control fields majority game ) , well this game you 4 different characters your party you ability put any character leader . characters excellent this game , i pretty much like all them ( gau funny , but he doesn't best abilities one secret characters you can't even control them all during battle ) . sabin blitz ability . those you who playing fighting games years pretty good understanding this but sadly when you make move , no matter which direction your facing , you still hae put same command same direction . instance , one moves rlr ( i am talking right left right control pad ) if your character facing right , then you insert command , but if you facing opposite direction , it still same command ( not opposite combination ) . when i first beat game , before beating it , i got all characters level 99 . this game also some best music ff game ( time anyway ) . collection itself : you get music cd , random battle screen like ff7 8 random battle loading screen , ff6 bonus menu looking stats enemies , cgi cinemas , ff5 pretty much like super nes ( or should i say super famicom ) version just exception random battle loading screens psone style opening cinema no extra bonuses because game never released usa square probably wanted people experience it without huge bunch bonus features . overall : if you like snes ff games , this right collection you ( chronicles which includes ff4 ( ff2 usa snes ) chrono trigger	1

there three things matter me when i sit down play game . ( 1 ) playability , ( 2 ) story , ( 3 ) graphics . this game excelled all three . ease directing my character choosing his moves so prominent felt so natural i just sort fell into my character role . few other rpg games , i didn't doubt second what i supposed move forward . story game deep riveting - but more importantly , sensible . this not just action game annoying , throw-away characters subplots go nowhere . you actually care characters involved you take keen interest what their future holds , even characters you only get see moment . ending especially well , it left me thinking where my character would go next , what he would , what path he would follow . even though i made his decisions throughout entire game , he still his own character - i simply shaped him bit . when i finally put controller down watched credits roll up screen , i heartbroken it over . but then i realized i could simply start all over again completely different character , end up completely different place . whole new experience . if you're anything like me , trust me when i say this game one kind . last , but certainly not least , graphics fantastic times breath-taking . graphics only work bring out story characters make universe game set all more believable . they never fail set tone whatever setting you find yourself . its predecessor , sith lords raised bar role-playing games . role-playing games , such final fantasy , while still enjoyable their own right , tend allow player almost no freedom all . sith lords allows astounding amount freedom . you literally go where you want , you what you want , however you want it . granted , it not grand theft auto , but then , gta not role-playing game . but while i am quick point out great aspects game , i most also point out bad . first major annoyance game continually froze i forced reset system start over . counter this problem , you'll forced save often different slots - game even warns you so . it not really big deal , but it get me little . second major annoyance my inability control all members my party proficiently - ai continally got me into trouble i could avoided . ( this one problems first knights old republic . ) other than , there nothing else worth mentioning . its predecessor , i hold this game highest esteem , eagerly look foward next ( if there one ) installment . enjoy game	1
