i got this phone basically free , but even taking into account , i'm pretty disappointed phone . this my first samsung , i'm pretty sure , my last one ! i owned nokia before i regret i " betrayed " it . now i wouldn't get anything besides nokia worst case maybe sony-ericsson . so here short list those " little things " make your life , this phone ( it combination t-mobile ) , annoying : - keys not comfortable use . - it not really comfortable open/close slider make it easier you put your thumb screen which leaves greasy all time . - putting comma , while writing text message , capitalizes next word - what logic ?! ( it annoys me because i use text messages lot)- you can't set camera shutter silent ... - you only save 1 phone type each category - what if person 2 business phones ... - you cannot choose e-mail address person contact list when you want send picture message e-mail address . there lot more those little illogical things just not thought through , like it would've nokia ( even model 5 years old ! )oh yeah , t-mobile really " contributed " " greatness " this phone , removing some features limiting others , like setting your mp3 ringtone ( although , there easy hack around it : just change extension . mp3 . 3gp	1

thanks god phone survive moderate fall . case pops open very easily despite supposedly snug fit time you receive case , its all loose after . disappointment , circular ' knob ' screws into back case attaches turn belt clip often screws out causing , again you guessed it , falls .	-1
let me count ways this thing let me down : 1 . you open it slide out full keyboard , making it vulnerable damage2 . it doesn't matter whether you open case or not . if it drops , case falls right open anyway , spilling your device whatever hard surface you trying protect 8525 . 3 . case so heavy it feels like it doubles weight device sticks out too far when you wear it . 4 . case so bulky it ensures you catch something , dropping everything ground damaged ( least that what happened me ) . super disappointed this product , case you couldn't tell	-1
originally , i purchased this heavy-duty case protect my new expensive 8525 . however , wearing case my belt belt clip , my phone fell out case several times when case cover accidentally opened up . luckily phone not functionally damaged , but i several big dents scratches case . i'm going stop using case now , since phone now already beat-up . latch mechanism cover loosen up use , especially since you'll open close it repeatedly access touch screen . also , it took bit getting used , open case make phone call . overall quality this case very good tho , because it fits phone very snuggly holes line up all buttons . i guess its great case if you don't wear it your belt . but i can't justify such huge case if i carry it my pocket .	1

after my nextel phone started acting up , i decided switch services because i liked razr style lot people i calling already verizon so " " calling bonus . i this phone all 3 days already miss my motorola i860 . you import only couple mp3s before phones memory full , unless you buy their $50 transflash card ( 1 gig largest ) . then , you cannot assign mp3s you import ringtones either , major disappointment me - again missing my i860 its 400+ ringtones i imported random wav , midi mp3 files . you cannot change softkeys main menu either calendar hard input events ( you set reminder all , there no option no reminder ) . all all , not what i grew accustomed my i860 . i'm already thinking $175 early term charge bargain compared what i spend over life my 2-year contract . leads me rip-off verizon , they charge you extra $35 sign only one-year term ! next time i'll read fine print , just upgrade my nextel	-1

there nothing quot ; universalquot ; this product . it'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones , but don't trust anything more demanding than this splitter . i hooked my laptop up through it fuse blew within one second . sadly , i'd bought four these since shipping cost much item itself , all four died when i tried them my laptop . back package says not use items use over total 10amps , which seemed reasonable , so i got out my ammeter figured out my laptop used 6amps most , so not only this busted , but they lie package . i managed open up splitter put some more heavy duty wiring stronger fuse , then it worked short time until i started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one springs inside couldn't handle 6amps heated up enough disfigure melt plastic around it . i give this item two stars only because you might want plug two cell phones simultaneously . anything else , beware	1
my problems nextel not stop when i canceled my service . i get problems service . when i went get new phone day before my contract expired , i course wanted keep my number . so i went get my cingular phone ( highly recommended ) , i old number switched my new number . today , i get mail my nextel statement month $200 early termination even though i not canceled my service , but simply got new phone switched my number over . this icing cake after 2 years absolutely amazingy bad service nextel . my town , not small town any means , there very few places any service . largest subdivision , you cannot get service anywhere . i constantly get comments people trying reach me get classic nextel line ... please hold while nextel subscriber you trying reach located . most time i would not even recieve incoming calls , calls would go straight my voice mail . not only would i not get calls , but often i would not even get voice mails until days or even weeks later . when i actually take calls ( call out ) , i cannot count number times i've my call dropped . i recieved so many different error messages sometimes i wonder if they just spend all their time nextel thinking different error messages program into their phones . brings me selling point nextel , famed well-loved direct connect feature . this absolute joke . direct connect only works maybe half time i tried use it . even then , middle conversation i would greeted loud beep my phone telling me i wont talking person anymore . course , i would expect nothing less nextel network . text messaging nextel next impossible . if it not take hours send or recieve message , it took days , or maybe didn't even come all . internet access fine , it rare instance it worked . course , when you don't service , you don't get internet access either . i constantly getting message " network not available " . calling trying complain nextel futile . trying get through customer service takes forever once you get through they nothing . my experience nextel nothing short disaster i write this trying warn anyone considering nextel . stick verizon or cingular you much happier end . don't make same mistake i .	-1
purchased this phone upgrade i530 , which i loved . i end 2 year contract , felt i would get something few more bells whistles - excited color screen icons . two my family members higher end nextels all work well . i would purchased one those , except i didn't really care camera my phone , this one reasonably priced ... i found out you get what you pay ! i560 felt almost cheap construction compared i750 , i870 even my old i530 . i it couple weeks when i started trouble clarity my calls - i could hear them , but they couldn't hear me . couple times , i screen go airplane mode , even when i hadn't touched it . fact you take whole phone out see who calling downside , too . my previous phone flipped open see who calling , but i holster could hold phone without disengaging it . not great design this holster . problem power supply . when charging phone , it especially important make sure plug seated tight - check says device attached - it comes out easy stops charging even when it appears plugged into phone correctly . then i am phone call speakerphone whole speaker just stops working . living california apparently gives us advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee . fortunately , we day 12 , after 54 minutes , one accidental disconnection nextel 6 customer service agents , i finally received return authorization placed new order . terrible , terrible phone . stay away it . hoping new one it way works much better ! michell	-1

although this product very nice , i feel though wording they use describe it incorrect . me words " charge all once " means i charge all devices only one cord plugs into wall . however , this not case . this item simply method organizing you devices . although it nice idea , it certainly not worth $34.99 i paid , if it wasn't gift , christmas wasn't 3.5 days away , i would return it . i feel using words , " charge all once " they purposely misleading customer .	1
i ' upgraded ' this phone recently treo 650 speaker audio problems ( don't all treo 650 suffer within year usage ? ) already replaced once refurbished one developed same problems . i loved my treo 650 anyway so i expected something equivalent 650 but what i got ' smartphone ' quite stupid battery life . i decided there definitely some glitch design ( some online geeks suggest it might actually sim card ) causing power run right out phone , sharp decline , even when its not use all possible extraneous functions disabled . add this fact palm website online user group not active right now ( so no users visibly discuss this among themselves ) , you don't think too long conclude palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward , when they recently dumped this cheaper " smartphone " market recently . palm , all i say pretty " stupid " wonder if this your last hurrah before exiting " smartphone " market ?	1
summary , microsoft software t-mobile service ruined brilliant design ( although couple flaws ) htc . there many pros cons this device service it shackled . i break it down hardware , software cell phone service provider . hardware pro's:a lot written this aspect device , so i'll keep this minimum - best form factor i've ever seen . this device provides you power blackberry without bulky hardware so i put it my pocket comfortably not look like geek belt holster . - key selling point me combined bluetooth , wi-fi quad-band connectivity enabled me connect wireless headset , cruise web pages access email when us or europe . - phone quality excellent . - keyboard layout excellent easy use medium sized emails . - battery life great when wi-fi not enabled adequate when it . ( i've rarely struggled dying battery . ) stand-by power management appears excellent . - charging device very quick . - display , while little small , crystal clear surprisingly easy use given its size . - camera pretty good it really great emailing photo people i'm traveling around . [ after all cons you'll read below you'll wonder why i ever bought device why i still use it . well here it : 1 . t-mobile locked me into 2 year contract very expensive device . 2 . it great hardware i use us europe , i'm just hoping microsoft finally get it right . ] hardware con's- touch sensitive volume button most ill-conceived feature i've ever seen . even after playing around various settings it still hard quickly set volume desired level . even worse , when using phone your ear or finger inadvertently hit control randomly change volume . - ti omap 850 201mhz not beefy enough software loaded onto device . however , blame could well laid microsoft door writing inefficient code poor scheduling software tasks applications . either way , performance very slow some basic functions ( see below ) i'm afraid some blame needs laid choice processor . software pro's- not many really come mind . software con ( i hope you're sitting comfortably)- when call call waiting phone fails give option user select which call take which call put hold or drop/ignore . occasions this problem occurred me call dropped/kept appears random preference switch incoming call no matter what depressed . other call dropped not put hold . - when call incoming keyboard locked , if user depresses green phone key call dropped . this extremely counter intuitive . if user presses anything other than " answer " key call dropped sometimes call dropped even when i depressed " answer " key . - contacts database extremely rudimentary very limited number views filters used . even worse , upon selection , contacts database takes 5 8 seconds open . now , i what some would call large database contacts , but considering palm os version responded immediately far more sophisticated use model this excuse not wash . it simply poorly architected database . - user interface entering new contact rudimentary ( all dialog windows this device . )- one most annoying aspects this device alarm clock . user interface looks like it written 10 minutes clearly not verified correctness . digital watch i 1982 same degree sophistication but more intuitive use model more thoroughly debugged . first all , user only gets select time if alarm or off . interface you would assume you could only set single alarm .... if only it obvious . best way explain this buggy piece software example : i set alarm 6am ; next day alarm goes off 6am . day i set alarm 7am - following day alarm goes off 6am 7am . next day i set alarm 7:30 am you guessed it , alarm now goes off three times . best i've able deduce ( course , this type behavior not documented user manual comes device ) user actively select " off " current setting before setting " " new time . but there no indication what alarms set , so after while or particularly busy week you loose track what set what isn't .... only way clear all alarms set hard re-boot . - calculator joke . if this took engineer 10 minutes write they should fired . calculator watch ' 80 more sophisticated features . user interface so bad it hard describe it words . - microsoft truly not understand how user would like use device instead insists using same usage model they've inflicted upon us since windows 95 . most features or function navigated through start menu button . applications nested features hidden behind several annoying menu selections . some features simply hard find , but should it really take so many menu selections find common tools or applications ? - use alarms or reminders ambiguous - put device " silent " mode , but leave alarms because you want sleep only want your alarm wake you up , example , not work . calendar reminders active they assigned alarm property instead their own or notification property . only way around this cancel reminders all day events .... otherwise you get alarm midnight . - so , my nokia phone thousand years ago , when i went europe my phone would simple selection new frequency i needed once landed . phone would then automatically connect provider available . it wasn't completely automatic , but user interaction simple intuitive . not dash . first all t-mobile doesn't help keeping radio button your online account you select enable international roaming . feature free so why not add selection anyway ? all you know when you get your destination your phone won't connect local network no matter what you . now , assuming you worked this out , you now faced challenge actually connecting local provider network . my blackberry this automatic , but course microsoft there selections make , searches activate various other contortions need gone through before you connect provider choice . assuming you get connected all . - activesync : this most annoying piece software it just not work . worse still , when it not work it gives cryptic error message stating error occurred some data lost next time you perform synchronization . it not provide you fix , hint or path so you don't lose data . it not even tell you data lost . so , i'm using microsoft mobile os microsoft xp microsoft outlook they can't get right ? ( ok , it maybe serves me right signing up so much microsoft , but come . ) this primary purchasing driver me . i am very busy want my schedule up date my pc pda - all time . it only way keep organized . i thought same provider all software i'd ok . also , this feature around over decade palm perfected blackberry .... how hard it ? there probably annoying nits i software , but those major ones . they major . considering this windows mobile 5.0 what earth they doing 1.0 , 2.0 , etc .? service provider pro- t-mobile useful me traveling europe . they much better coverage over there than us ( where i'm actually paying ) . - their package competitive . service provider con : - coverage not good enough . i'm san francisco i dead spots my house . - their back-end connectivity your email providers terribly buggy . random times you get cryptic messages saying you must something wrong your connection emails can't accessed . but you know there nothing wrong your connection because you've browser . also , there whole day emails not accessible . because many issues i'd email set up maintaining connection i went through various debug routines wondering what failed . when i finally called technical support they told me their service down - no apology , no notification , no nothing . certainly no minutes make up inconvenience . ( so , why didn't i call technical support earlier ? read below ... )- their technical support structure terrible . i collectively wasted over 12 hours my life their " help " line . i'm not going go into details it would just take too long . bottom line , if you problem your phone say " dash " prompt then ask tier three data support . everything you get before waste your time technicians you'll encounter inadequate training . if you then put hold given number dial - not it - this cycles you back around tier two data support you go back back line someone understands device . so , should you buy it ? wait until windows mobile 6.0 comes out least . maybe provider pick up device time . then see what else available	1

after reading numerous positive reviews this phone , i purchased . here main issues i found this phone : 1 ) buttons too small , particularly main control button . you used side your fingers ensure you not hit too buttons same time . , believe me , i not very large hands . 2 ) if you quite few contacts your phone , you irritated delay when you scroll down quickly select contact . you notice if you not careful , you dial wrong contact due delay when scrolling selecting quickly , so if this you , aware . 3 ) you must open cover look inside see if you missed call or message . very inconvenient !! there no indication show this top screen , only inside screen . 4 ) occasion , display outside phone stops working entirely . what you just need power phone down they back up again . not optimal , i probably just got bad phone , but i am just waiting situation get more frequent , so i then deal likely nightmare get replacement phone motorola . note : i no personal vendetta against motorola , but wanted provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff i bought into before purchasing	-1
this headset major flaw - connections headset phone full static . other parties don't hear it , but their voice constantly zapped static , i'm asking them repeat themselves . i've compared it couple other headsets i've got , they don't this problem same locations . actually , this headset static problems anywhere - office , car , out walking , you name it . yourself favor avoid this one	-1

phone may fine but i never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked . perhaps it phones fault i never received text messages even though they deducted my account . overall their customer service awful . days waiting receiving no information . i file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving issue or they not filled out right . i spent hours phone them never problem fixed . now i thrown away bunch money crappy service . i plan just run out minutes then disconnect phone . its garbage . i went t-mobile sidekick already am way happier	-1

i've using my t809 since january mostly love it . three main problems : 1 ) there some sort pinhole leak upper right corner screen where dust gets behind screen lens . looks like crap when display inactive . i've read other people this problem too . 2 ) i hardly ever use this mp3 player because you use their poorly designed headset ( they won't stay my ears ! ) because you can't hear phone ring over headset while listening music . 3 ) ring starts off softly builds louder volume . if i phone my pocket i miss first couple rings ( too quiet ) time i realize i'm getting call fumble get it out my pocket , i've usually missed call . this sucks i don't think there setting disable this " feature " . it close ideal , but no cigar . camera great , reception great , easy use . but i'll probably look something similar but better after my contract expires . btw , if you get insurance thru tmobile any phone , make sure you see it bill . i problem water damage three weeks after buying . tmobile claimed i never asked insurance , but fortunately amazon exchanged it .	1
i just picked up one these my motorola cell phone . it more than enough volume . it comes both right left ear adapter . fits pretty good i medium sized ears . its really light but because it clips your ear earpiece fits slighly your ear you feel you wearing it . it very comfortable though . if you make lot cell phone calls this very good ear headset .	1
these work great keeping earbuds comfortably place while allowing one hear others speaking , say grocery store . course they not provide audiophile quality sound , but they're great listening podcasts while doing shopping . only downside they bulky so not fit any earbud holder while not use . taking eargels off store earbuds off possible but difficult enough annoying	1

i keep this short point this best phone i ever owned . its great taking pictures pictures come out so clear	1
these javoscreen treo 650 protectors really very different anything you've normally seen . typically , 95% screen protectors very thin material you stick screen , hope against hope you don't bubbles , but you almost always . when screen off , you see bubbles , thankfully when screen , bubbles pretty invisible ..... but these javoscreen protectors completely different animal . they thick , tough , relatively firm . because those properties , they go no bubbles , they easily moveable ( adjustable ) should you not get it perfectly first time . further , they come little squeegee thingy make sure its there good . this state art screen protectors . this all becomes even bigger issue men , because whiskers , over time screen get dulled scratched . because thickness quality these , scratches screen no longer issue .	1
i not any problems this phone . i dont use it long periods time ... only car text . adding minutes easy i really get my moneys worth rollover . i averaged it less than 10 bucks month 600 minutes spare ... so its great me . i got better ringtones online still waiting see wallpaper . overall , i would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1

this good holster my v220 . it doesnt hang up me much erson who last reviewed it . holster i give it 4 stars because its function hold cell phone place your belt . one problem i it it holds phone down where strap should , so strap it wouldnt work too well . also because it holds it where strap , it adds little wear area . other than its good holster price . thats one my problems . i paid 14 dollars this my local mall , which highly over priced my standards . amazon seems like great place buy it , but if you search motorola v220 phone accessories , then you find site free shipping it , its 7 bucks . theres also site it 3 bucks , but shipping . i trust amazons shipping though . so if you want functional holster , get this one	1
i've virgin mobile customer few years now agree earlier reviewer -- if you want phone-phone ( without all extra hoopla ) this isn't bad deal . i " * bought " red slice couple weeks ago ( take note i'm not one those people cell phone perpetually growing out one ear ) my needs ( emergencies , quick calls family grocery store ) it just right . good points : i got mine " * free " reward zone points best buy . fits into small purse or pocket easily . nice looking ( someone mistook it " chocolate " other day ) . clear reception ( long distance calls just crystal local ; not sure if this " area " thing , but apparently service around chicago solid ) . pay-as-you-go option works well someone who doesn't spend lot time phone . my slice holds charge just fine ( i've noticed other reviewers said this problem , but so far , so good ) doesn't heat up , someone else mentioned ( maybe reviewer got defective phone or battery ? ) . not so good points:it so slim my husband bet me i'll lose phone within couple months ( could easy misplace if you keep stacks papers books your desk ) . someone else mentioned odd graphics ( hot dog dripping blue sauce , some sort pipe looking cartoons teeth . seriously , i no idea what those things might ) , but i say it workable if you sense humor (: yes , buttons small . i small hands , slender fingers , i still manage bump " 3 " whenever i'm trying shut off phone . sometimes it difficult turn ( button doesn't always respond when i push it , though could i'm wimp ) , but once it it fine . i'm thinking this get broken more use . all all , it not bad phone . beautiful red . i find myself staring it just appreciate its beauty ( phone confessions ! ) . i'm satisfied mine . since i haven't forked out hundreds dollars -- or any dollars , really -- i won't feel too guilty when/if i manage lose it under pile paperwork !	1

what it needs ... hell palm changes stylus every new model	1
i ordered this headset silver - webtreo sent out white , but said even though it appears white , it really silver ! we argued color , i finally convinced them samsung makes white , silver , red , black . it took almost month get resolved , but i finally silver headset i ordered . it very small , light , easy use . there 3 different size earpieces better fit . headset gets 4 stars , webtreo only gets 1 star . i wouldn't order any products them again	1
only problem it easy drop scrren smudges easil	1
i recently took chance this item , i am happy report its not bad ! i actually not looking forward swivel ( bad experience ) but swivel very solid . it looks good . skin not best , but i like it . only problem i it you take out phone completely order use it .	1
i nothing but good things say this purchase product . it works looks great . i only wish they could make pda phone wasn't big boat	1
i wasn't expecting lot this extremely inexpensive case , but i'm very impressed . i bought accessory one , total cost $4 . case fits nearly perfectly , every hole right size right place , not exact possible but everything works just well without case . others complained chipping paint but week i've using this it hasn't chipped yet . can't any better $$$	1
if you're looking slim cover won't add lot bulk your razr , this one great . no , it probably won't provide much protection if you drop your phone . it protect your razr scratches fingerprints , rubberized material easy grip feels great your hand . cutouts outside display , camera ( i v3m ) , logo perfectly placed whole cover fits well . i don't use belt clip , cover itself adds hardly any bulk so i just keep my phone my pocket . without belt clip , there small ' snap ' sticks out bit back cover but it really no big deal . $3 , you can't beat this . : -	1
thought i'd post this info here , since this subject still confuses people . i just talked cust care representative , who confirmed cancelling included data plan before 180-day period invalidate $250 amazon phone rebate . well , i guess major turn down me this phone this offer , since i don't really need data plan , planned use wifi connectivity most time . any comments ? i still would like give it 5 stars since i believe it great product . i'll take one star off however , due its weak battery life , lack standard audio connection ( 2.5 " or 3.5 " minijack ) .	1
many my colleague use blackberry emails but i give try this brand-new 3g/wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone . 3g wi-fi works very well our area . it also worked very well europe after activation cellphone cingular customer service . e-mail internet works very well both locations . addition 1gb microsd chip actually solve many bluetooth file transfer issues , since i simply stick microsd card into regular sd cassette , use card reader usb cable file transfer pc or mac like other memory chips . color calibration default focus camera very good video very good quality cameraphone . again , 1gb allow you take very long video windows media player format . installation good mail system automatically synchronize lotus note emails , contacts , calendar any time , any place , automatically chime schedule notices . only drawback battery life , which require frequent charges , slow keypad phone calls ( i not know how silence keypad ) , little tough keyboard touch . lack shift keys both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult ( especially shift+a ! ) . addition , microsoft word processing slow , so excel , which require faster chip . overall , great all-around pocket pc this generation	1

i've my tracfone 5 months now . reception generally good . once i got phone activated , i haven't any problems . tracfone ' refer friend ' program give each 100 free minutes . all you send me email asking referral . my email debsclay@gmail.com thank you	1

incredible price all three items . just car charger alone , verizon wanted $24.00 . plastic cover phone very good razr phone scratches pretty easily	1
this charger awesome . it very compact when retracted when cord extended , it doesn't get way like spiral cords . cord thin , not bulky . i never measured cord when extended , but it much longer than most	1

picture quality sucks price . colors way freaky . screen perfect text but not pictures . viewing pictures this terrible . keyboard ackward first . manual needs much more detailed . sorta confusing use if not familliar palm pilots . i expected use it like typical pilot , where you write screen . this feature not implemented . overall , this very good phone . good reception , great sound quality !! speakerphone great ! neat features . worth $$	1
this good , thick screen protector stays solidly stuck your screen . i don't foresee it peeling ... ever . it slightly frosted surface cut down glare , but frosting impossible see when screen . i've washed mine , it comes out clean new sticky side stays sticky . just very careful not bend it all or stress it one place . it extremely sensitive bending if you bend it , it never go back . so extra careful	1

( i didn't even need go look com port installation says because bitpm scans ports until it finds phone)note .. when installing , make sure you pick right driver .. if you xp , choose xp driver , not nt , or win98 or other driver . it part file name .. look xp driver file name .	1

this great phone . pity you cant get subsidized version via carrier . bit pricey but worth it . great camera interface . super easy upload pictures straight flickr via phone . this top selling handset europe - but tricky get hold us which still relatively dark ages when it comes mobile technology	1
this phone all feature i wanted . camera takes really good picture . better than all phone i've seen so far . xenon flash really helps taking night pictures . i use own w800i this one takes way better pictures . it auto-focus other several fucntion i haven't used yet . mp3 player also very useful . i love how u just drag drop mp3 files phone . it also very easy navigate through phone functions . my computer no problem recognizing phone once drivers loaded . it just like plugging flash drive . screen very bright clear . screen resolution decent . it very easy customize also . i dl program online customize theme . battery lasted lot longer than i expected . usually last around 3-4 days . only complains i this phone headphones . walkman series way better headphones so when you get this make sure buy new headphones adapter . complain expensive memory stick micros . i couldn't use memory my w800i phone . i wish they use sd micros which cheaper more widely used	1
photo this premiun side case not photo . side case photo treo logo producto don't i	1
this case great protecting my treo , but downside i remove it case use it . i purchased it because i actually dropped my treo when walking it balanced my portfolio , now i clip it portfolio it secure safe , i don't run risk leaving it behind	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
driver install easy bitpim access works just fine . cable i received also charges phone ( vx8300 verizon ) .	1
i ordered this cable ( two them actually ) use lg 8300 . driver disc contains software 8300 only not 5300 . once loaded , it found phone easily . i used bitpim ( free program you find internet)to transfer data phone . price cable excellent . i unable locate data cable locally happy find one amazon , even though it only available through third party . all all , i recommend product those need cables lg 8300 . those wishing use it lg 5300 please aware there appears no driver included your phone .	1
got this couple weeks ago . rubber suit covers every bit phone so i am confident i won't getting any scratched . it flips open ok . you attach charger data cable just fine but ear peice jack seems little scrunched . you can't access tf card . there strap goes over top so your v710 definitely isn't going fall out . 3 minor qualms : see through plastic little glare it , especially when there oil lcd suit . also , it adds just enough weight it flips open little knock . ( noticed this most when phone horizontally mounted my belt ) . last , flap sort comes into field view camera . you already know v710 camera crap its specs , but i occasionally hold down little flap . i got used it real quick	1
top part telephone gets loose very often , elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
this cable saves me lot money . i don't need buy stuff online when now i download it straight my pc . makes it easy transfer pictures , videos , ring tones , contact numbers . it great put things off . also great keeping back up	1
this holster far better than stock holster comes phone . it lower profile which means it sits closer your belt . it also much easier actuate than stock holster . thumb tab oriented just right direction easy in/out . phone clips solidly doesn't fall out	1
product functions well , looks good . if i could change one thing , swivel action just little looser than i would like , but definatly not problem	1
i highly recommend this bundle price . less than cost offical verizon travel charger , you get travel charger , home charger usb cable driver cd . everything works just fine . instructions usb cable very lacking , so here my suggestions : you use windows media player move music over your phone using sync feature , you use free program such bitpim other file transfers your pc phone .	1
if you want cell phone well made , looks good , feels good use really good phone opposed phone bunch other things v360 excellent choice . it enough features keep things interesting but easy use above all really good phone not sacrifice call quality or battery life bunch useless features i don't want . it also looks feels good thus pleasure use	1
i purchased this 24.99 steal ! pros : -clear voice clarity . nice signalseasy set up sync phoneruns nimh batteries . cons : -not good range . if cell my back pocket jean , blutetooth set doesnt work well there quite lot signal break up	1
this charger excellent value . it works beautifully my treo 700p smartphone . i love retractable cable quickly rewinds inside device touch button , making whole unit quick easy store . only complaint i've heard large , blue power light too bright night . it doesn't annoy me , but my wife asks me turn device sideways or upside down , so blue glow doesn't shine up into her eyes . no problem	1
this excellent product it protects my treo 650 without hiding its style . i chose treo because its unique look excellent features however , case palm didn't work me because i use phone lot i dont time put phone back case everytime . so , it gets thrown my purse other items which then scratch it . i also bought body glove case while i use phone while it , it hides treo real look plus typing keyboard covered plastic drag . this one seems even enhance treo style	1
good battery life ( certainly much better than old one it replaced ) . most part it indistinguishable original . however it doesn't fit quite snugly dock-style charger came my phone ( not kind plugs into bottom phone , but kind sits your desk contacts battery directly ) . little annoying it tends fall out -- if i'm not paying attention i'll wake up next morning my phone won't actually charged -- but it still works	1
item arrived quickly exactly advertised , charges phone 15 minutes driving	1
cable exactly what i needed , much more inexpensive than other alternatives . drivers provided accompanying cd worked but not complete i would liked . i am still very satisfied , it only cable i really after , especially price which i bought it	1
you might pay little bit more but reliability offered oem products gives one much peace mind . i am always willing wait little longer pay little more if i know what i am getting not just counterfeit . i think i got my money worth	1
great product - works quickly when charging my moto v555 car . highly recommend it	1
i just bought this case few weeks ago , it holding up very well . it hasn't broken or scratched yet . plus , it makes my phone looks lot better . well i hope this thing last many months down tough road . ciao	1

this product great ... i'm glad it came cloth , too	1
but it some faults . i it some time now , i got it my 11th birthday . i reviewed cingular version too , even though mines verizon . faults : very short battery life - i charge it almost every day ! camera - picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up . good parts : big screen - easy read ! recording videos - even though you get 15 seconds , i still use make funny videos my friends . it style - i love color style ! my friends all jealous . overall , i think it great phone	1

extra lithium battery ideal new i860 camera phone . desktop charger comes second charging slot so you always spare battery ready those last minute low battery alerts . it saves time one last thing worry . charge itself fast too .. i found 750 mah lithium ion battery dependable nomatter what stage remainng battery life you begin recharging . it doesn't weakin my i1000 battery when charging started mid range . however , first time you charge or recharge your lithium battery most important charge all . you must let initial or first chatge run out completey before begining recharge battery . " deader " battery it first run better life battery standby time charges come . highly recommended	1
two years now i not any problems my motorola i530 cell phone , which serviced telus-nextel . over all i would rate service good , not excellent . rarely i trouble getting service area where i would normally get strong signal . this problem normally last roughly under minute before my phone once again operational . i'm daily commuter canada united states . my phone doesn't miss beat , it automatically switch telus canadian server nextel american server still same great reception . cell phone itself big , bulky , heavy , ugly . it not come equipped any cool picture or video features . it direct connect feature so you use your phone like walky-talky when talking friend same option their phone . neat fun . reception phone clear crisp , it seldom cut out conversation . therefore i not expect quality sound down loaded music so poor . what most impressive phones durability . this cell phone really take beating . i dropped my phone numerous times . i thrown my phone across room friend who failed catch it more then once . one those fancy little phones would smashed into million peaces . road trip , my phone fallen off my lap , out car sat side road three days rain . i finally backtracked relocated my phone . i recharged phone it worked expected . my phone never let me down , i always gotten service , battery not died me thus far . battery when fully charged last thirty hours low moderate usage . if you looking quality phone built stand punishment not desire all those new phone gimmicks this phone you .	1
i'm very happy this case . i just looking simple belt carrier would protect my treo 700p , but would allow complete access treo when i wanted use it . other words , i didn't want something attached treo permanently . this trick . it simple , but looks good . seems solidly made well	1
motorola i560 nicely sized , easy use , indestructible . these features what look when looking new cell phone . not only i560 smaller than most bulky nextel or sprint phones , such i710 , but it unbreakable model outside display . this something new unbreakable model . size important , especially nextel , because most their early models very big awkward , like i710 . i560 perfectly massive tiny . this nice because it not vulnerable cracked screens antennas . it equipped gripping well which helps when it comes using direct connect , placing calls , receiving calls . i710 very smooth exterior . it nice looking , but harder keep your hand . more damage i710 because there no gripping . if , however , i560 slip out your hands , don't worry . dropping this phone not concern due extreme durability . if you worried scratching outside , get leather or plastic cover i t.t he ease use i560 i710 close because they very similar menu options simplicity ; however , big difference outside display i560 . without even opening phone , you place call pushing stop butt top phone scroll through your most recent calls . this safe feature use car . speaker phone clarity improved i560 . i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word , where i560 still not perfect aspect , but improvement better than nothing . durability cell phone essential . there nothing worse than take cell phone repair , or even worse , replace it . much use most people get out their cell phones , how it stands up daily wear tear vital satisfaction phone . i560 one unbreakable models nextel , exceptionally tough . when i710 dropped , it often goes blank screen causes problems reception service . i560 completely opposite . overall performance , mass , resilience i560 surpasses i710 . when compared , i560 better choice .	1

going charging my phone couple times day charging it once every couple days definitely changed opinion my a900 , making it less high-maintenance allowing me some web browsing , headset using , general multimedia mayhem without constant paranoid fears this fooling around cost me when oem battery decides die most inopportune time . quite cheap price freedom peace mind . it 12 hours thing yet change 3 bars . what !? aside piddling cost this battery ( which double tax you'd pay battery sprint dealership ) , there tax bulge it creates its backside . me , this not insignificant , but ignorable , it doesn't detract aesthetics phone it provides way grip it when dialing , talking , or using buttons	1
samsung a900 blade excellent phone . i say so many good things it . only bad thing it i encountered horrid battery life . battery life problem second i walked out sprint . nobody wants charge their phone 2-4 times day . standard battery a900 i charging my phone ridiculous amount times . but that what you get razor thin phone . so course i searched finally found this battery which crucial . this battery life saver . sure get this one because it cheapest i found , i extensive searching . also this one comes door which very crucial . i've seen some extended batteries sold without this door i almost made mistake buying one without door . you would screwed without door fits extended battery . what would you , put rubber band around it ? heck no . well anyway , now i this battery , my phone last all day without worries dying just like my previous models thick batteries . my a-900 still very thin even this extended battery sticks out little . don't worry , you're phone still look great this battery you enjoy all it features without dying	1
i palm tx which i loved , but didn't like go wifi sites web . i also moto v557 phone which best cell phone i've ever owned . i purchased treo best both worlds . i like treo 680 , but i read all instructions , call customer service practice using certain features not frustrated phone . example , i difficulty answering phone using touch screen practice pressing small send button . ( which i usually missed while rush answer phone . ) i like web because it fast enough i don't miss wifi . i get used fact many web sites aren't small enough phone , but it excellent using google maps , looking up business giving number easy dial ( just tap blue line ) , checking bank accounts , online orders , movies , weather especially news . email good too palm software . i didn't use express or getgood email . i absolutely love chat setting messaging . now , phone story . i miss ease dialing traditional cell . my bluetooth not work well 680 . people typically tell me they can't hear me so i now use corded ear bud . bluetooth doesn't work voice dial feature purchased separately . you can't insert hard pauses phone numbers require you dial extensions . there no way delete one digit time if you misdial number . you leave phone dialing page return redial . phone dials slowly if there other programs running . lastly , you can't check your calendar or other features after answering phone if key pad locked when you answered phone . you hang up person , unlock phone , check calendar call them back . battery life poor , but i keep charger car which helps great deal . all all , i love my treo 680 . i purchased additional software i strongly recommend . they : launcher x(excellent ) , mobil write , treo voice dialing , oxford dictionary thesaurus , scrabble mars needs cows . i also recommend you keep you treo locked security password . i not found carrier offer insurance this $400 phone	1
well i read through just every review prior purchasing this phone almost thinking twice it after reading some reviews here , but i decided take plunge go it . well i'm glad i . all i say this phone pleasure use get-go . it its flaws but what phone doesn't ? question whether you're going go flip out over alarm clock or volume strip or it trivial issue you . most gripes others just seem little me . let talk pros cons : pros : 1 . call quality excellent . no static what so ever . no dropped calls . my area good t-mobile coverage so i can't complain . phone it what it supposed . make good quality calls . it also pairs my bluetooth headset ( plantronics 510 ) really well . speaker phone good quality too . 2 . internet works great . i $5.99 plan yes edge isn't fastest but it gets job . it doesn't matter where i'm i check my email , finds restaurants or directions , or just surf web when i'm bored . it really came handy when i out vacation lost . wifi works well too . didn't want fork out money hotspots though . 3 . camera 1.3 megapixels decent quality . no it not going replace my regular camera but i found it really handy when i forgot take my camera my friend wedding , but still able take quality pictures . i haven't tried videos yet though . 4 . mp3/video player : now speakers this phone aren't greatest so i wouldn't use them listening music but when plugged into headset it sounds pretty good . i bought 2gb microsd card bought here amazon now i hold ton music movies . videos looks pretty nice i'd admit . this thing my travelinig entertainment center . i even found way play original nintendo games this thing trying mike tyson punchout like back old days . 5 . calendar/schedule : i pda but some reason i'm more compelled actually use my calendar keep my schedule this thing than i my pocket pc . probably because convenience reasons . 6 . smartphone applications : i'm medical field i keep all my medical applications this phone . i quickly look up drug references or research diseases . i really thought i'd need touchscreen order better navigate these programs while it might slightly easier stylus , i don't find it all necessary still navigate pretty well . i just wish processor slightly faster some these apps , but it more than adequate . i'm not sure why people don't think there lot programs smartphone . programs written wm5 compatable ppc well smartphones equally . [ ... ] . 7 . appearance : everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks so i . it looks great feels great . i saw this side side motorola just looked so much bulkier ... well ... not nice . rubber backing feels awesome . 8 . battery : all i use this phone it makes it through day plenty battery spare which all i really ask . i wouldn't go 2 days without charging battery though . you should charge it every night . cons : 1 . windows mobile 5 : mighty microsoft needs write cleaner program . however windows mobile 6 way free download t-mobile customer soon so hopefully that'll take care some problems . i swear just turn bluetooth pair up my bluetooth device takes me whole minute just because how hard it navigate wm 5.2 . volume strip : yeah like everyone says it sucks . i disabled mine . adjusting volume this thing tedious best . luckily my music/video programs well my stereo headset allow me easier ways adjust volume so it not such issue me . 3 . alarm clock : now i don't use this all much but i see what everyone says it yeah it pretty idiotic written program . however rather than writing half page how bad it i downloaded free one internet works great so my life now goes . summary : so i use this device make quality phone calls , surf web , check email , play games , listen music , watch movies , monitor my schedule , check my medical references , take decent quality pictures . all this thing needs now laser beam cut through metal it'd greatest gadget known man	1
this my first smartphone i've lot fun it so far . so small , keys remarkably easy use . i often connect it my laptop via usb cable . if you windows xp ms activesync 4.2.0 , your pc/laptop recognize it network device . little bonus app dash lets you share internet connection ( granted you data plan ) no extra cost . if you get add-on micro sd card ( $80 ) , you'll no need buy ipod . windows media player ( which comes standard ) works just well . it built 802.11 ( or ? ) card . when i'm range wi-fi , i use skype save my minutes . i hope t-mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch loophole :) few cons : -there no scroll wheel like blackberry . -the battery charge doesn't last longer than day or so if you've got data push outlook enabled . if i forget charge it night , i'm sol . -the volume strip righthand side drives me nuts . i'm constantly hitting it mistake . when i , annoying popup interrupts whatever i'm doing . you disable volume strip , but it kindof important certain apps like skype windows media player . simple classic volume dial side would huge improvement . strip never seems work right when i really intend adjust volume . -the keyboard nice , but touch screen would better certain apps . there no way cut-and-paste	1
headset works fine , people who i talk says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well , but i doubt battery stand 7 hours talk time , also it not too easy put it your ear other headset	1

this better than we thought it would . even though keys covered , it still pretty tactile . would liked something protect screen . overall , great protection price . looks better in-hand than pictures on-line	1
me main problems all headsets come receiving end either : . feedback loop : where other person hears themself speakb . ambient noise : other end hears everything around you , especially carin minimizing these , mobile freedom bluetooth best . i've tested my other 3 headsets people same call this one ranks highest voice clarity without extraneous noises . me , i hear everyone fine all headsets , but conversation two-way street if you've ever used headset , i'm sure you're tired hearing , " take me off stupid thing ! " negatives this headset far outweighed call clarity . yes , it big ugly , but your friends thank you . other negative aware ( although i assume this more due age my headset it only recently started doing this ) i've found after 1 year , while battery still holds charge well , it sometimes drops link phone when i hang up after call i can't get it back until i recharge thing . like i said , it getting bit old though . overall , if i going buy new one , i'd get this one . far other 3 tested , i'll rank them order call quality ( best worst ) . plantronics discovery 655 ( not too bad , but hard keep your ear)jensen stereo headphones wbb100rx ( more wireless stereo headphones than calling)motorola hs850 ( looks cool , but total piece garbage) p.s. if you're wondering why i 4 headsets it because there nothing worse than losing use one your hands while talking phone . 1 car , 1 home , 1 ... well you get picture .	1
top line : this best blackberry i've ever used , among best phones i've ever used . i use it work after hours out compromise functionality style/size . i've ( some what grudgingly ) using blackberry since first " pager-style " 4 line text device 8100 breakthrough me . finally , i corporate device treats me like consumer ! good : - great voice dial : particularly if you commuter headset . no need record your voice each address entry- just say who you want call it it doesn't understand you it prompt you more info . - size appearance : finally i don't look like dork talking something size my palm . phone small many phone-only candy bars . - easy private email set-up ( all modern blackberries ) . seems some sort auto set-up mac mail gmail , others too i imagine- macintosh compatibility : i just bought " missing sync " apple mac os ($40 usd ) synchronize my address book , calendar , tasks notes my macbook pro . works great ! software provided rim not very easy use . - fantastic screen innovative " outlook today " style summery screen missed calls , latest emails etc . look this feature one alternate themes ships phone . - others mentioned , keyboard very good . coming full size bb keyboard , i thought i might miss it , but 8100 breeze use . not good : - speaker phone functional sound quality general fine . nothing like my sony ericsson though ... - i think i minor voice quality issue phone my motorola h700 headset ( best headset i've ever owned ) . i think it might compatibility issue . - more mac compatibility would appreciated - like native isync bluetooth support	1
i've this phone week now i'm glad i waited post review because my initial reaction not very positive . coming owning razr many windows-based devices , there initial learning curve some functions . also , i not convinced strange keyboard would really recognize what you attempting type . boy i wrong one . ok , so review . my motivation purchasing primarily get phone first , few bells whistles when i just want play device . pearl fits bill perfectly . phone quality excellent . loading ringtones ( pain first ) proved relatively easy once i little research . ringtones play very loud clear . music player much better than first impressions would lead you believe . after few hours frustration , i all ready purchase 3rd party app . again , some research , visited few forums , found out there much more functionality included music player than you might realize . owner nano , i disappointed interface player . but once you go into menu functions , you'll find much more functionality . it not ipod , but it works decent replacement . if you're not ipod owner , you'll likely no complaints . sound tunes quite nice when using headphones . camera only so-so , but i don't really care anyway . must admit i thought it would better since it megapixal camera . couple pictures i took dark somewhat grainy . part why i dropped my rating 5 stars . far email , i bb work they won't let me use non-work issued device access network , so i no opinion email functionality . organizer features ( calendar , tasks , notes , etc ) seem more than adequate . much better than any my old pocket pc devices . only complaints i would there still 2 basic things i haven't able figure out while i'm admittingly not techie , these should pretty basic intuitive . one , i would like set one my ringtones default ringer . should fairly simplistic but i can't figure it out . two , i would like change order icons some themes . again , should pretty basic , but no go . almost forgot , can't listen music through bluetooth . not sure why , but this really my only major complaint . only minor complaints . all all , pretty sweet device . btw , form factor looks simply best out there . i came so close purchasing blackjack , very happy i went pearl . update - figured out how set default ringtone move icons . coming windows mobile environment , i expecting something lines : start-programs-etc-etc . everyting windows takes so many keystroks . pearl , it so easy . i simply expecting it much more difficult based my prior experience . i'm going still keep it 4 stars because lack bt stereo . otherwise , close perfect device i've used ( i've used quite few )	1
this product perfect , all i needed move pictures my phone my pc . highly recommended .	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
this phone great ! it all basic features i wanted out phone i able fix low ringtone problem searching " audiovox 8610 hack " over internet . you purchase cable ebay d/l some free softwares over net . then you make all ringtones you ever wanted free . course you computer-savey so . so don't it unless you know what you're doing . phone allows 20 seconds mp3 midi playback each ringtone . cool thing each ringtone attached phone number phonebook so you know who calling ring . i downloaded bunch sound effects wav files net mix ' match them into mp3 file some great ringtones . example : 3 stooges sound + bell ring + whistle + homer " doh " + wolf howl - all one 20 second ringtone . i also made some ringtones out my favorite rock songs well . i noticed some songs sound-effects louder than others . thus i only keep loudest ringtone they're very loud ! i only set sound volume 3 i hear ring my pocket backpack . overall , this phone always sale places like target . if you make your own ringtone download it into phone , you all free custom ringtones you could ever dream	1
i bought my cell through auction site 2 months ago , so i got good deal it . well , some mentioned phone shutdown me only once while i using qwerty keyboard . other than i no problems , call reception great . camera this phone isn't greatest but i don't need it high end basic fun pics i take . if you're looking get zoom , larger , clearer pictures this isn't phone you . camera screens bit confusing but i've learned deal it my pics come out i like . strange feature speakerphone , while it quite loud clear , kyocera placed it inner flip side phone which muffles sound . aside these things , i love my switchback . qwerty keyboard perfect txting but may too cumbersome larger fingers keys small . far plans concerned i don't any problems w/ over charges since i 18 cents/min plan . it good know monthly plans aren't recommended though . bonus per minute plans sugar mama service , where you get free airtime giving your opinion minute video clips . good purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money . this cell isn't only young crowd , i'm over 25 mom . i got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry qwerty phones those require addt'l internet service plans ( like blackberry , black jack palm treo ) . i only wanted easily send txts it one compact phone . this ideal me	1
i purchase this phone both my wife i , we both love them . windows mobile 5 takes little time learn navigate , but very versatile functional . reception call quality great , pairing bluetooth headset quick painless . screen bright crisp . there no 3g my area , but edge works good speed bearable simple web browsing . media player works well . battery life good 3g turned off . this phone comes both standard extended battery . pretty heavy usage , i still 1/2 battery power night . 3g said really suck power , though . lots lots 3rd party software available make this phone pretty much whatever you want	1
product ok , don't think it'd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up . but it aesthetically appealing , protect small scuffs scrathes	1
you pretty much anything you would like this product !! only draw back i could find it doesnt charge while you it plugged . other then , you manager anything you would like	1
silicone protective covering treo exactly what i wanted just what i expected it . it fits my treo 650 perfectly i couldn't happier . i am going buy different color	1
compared " face out " belt clip i previously , this " face " version proved bit more stable sturdy so far . hopefully , it remain so . price , it not too hard appreciate .	1
this great cover sansa mp3 player . it heavy duty rubber thin where it thicker all necessary places . it hard plastic screen shield protects sansa screen scratching or shattering . you'd silly not purchase this $20 case protect your $150+ investmen t.t he one downside i forsee cover too thick bottom allow player sit most cradles , docks , or speakers . it not difficult put case , but it would frustrating take it off often . just something consider if you see yourself using player docks or speakers often . standard usb cable come product works great toughskin	1
while i thankfully haven't test protective qualities this product , it appears it job nicely . only thing i would change give it fixed belt clip	1
i really like this protective cover . it very well made , seems like it excellent job protecting sansa even fall . funny thing now it toughskin i am much less likely drop it . before i bought toughskin , my e280 very slippery easily dropped . now it case , it very easy hold grip very little pressure . it true buttons easier push toughskin than it without it . hard plastic screen cover surprising positive this case well . only problem screen cover seems scratch more easily than i would expect . overall , this excellent product i would not hesitate recommend	1
i little skeptical buying this case my phone . i wanted holster wasn't sloppy generic model didn't fit . i absolutely pleased when this one arrived i tried it my motorola v180 . it fits like glove looks good . no complaints here . so if you v180 your fence taking plunge buying this let me assure you , you won't disappointed . added bonus money you save over buying one your cell phone dealer :	1
this all folks who got free or nearly free motorola v180 - spend money this case protect your phone ! i looked many different cases stores online hoping find something handsome but even more importantly - really protective . v180 apparently few comments home screen going ka-plooky - ' nuf said - i needed better grade , clear interior protector screen touchpad . sydney harbour gets high marks this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear , quality stuff . secondly , super-soft , matte black leather sweet fit - nice snug , form-fitting no feel strain or awkward stretching . cut outs perfectly lined up too - there one speaker phone feature back ( not mentioned ads ) . snap antenna loop it gives whole thing very nice custom look feel . sure this might look like lot review simple product - but if you're like me only allow few little bits finery your life , you try make smart carefully considered purchases . nice yourself your phone - go sydney harbour avoid cheaper stuff	1
we deperate charger . local stores seemed out them . we got it overnight requested . unbelieveably fast . thank you - thank you - thank you !	1
skin great shipped described . it really helps protect my . i like texture skin , feels like rubber . overall , it worth buying . it really protects my scratches	1
this very nice sleek cover gives your phone great feel look	1
i love my blackberry pearl my swivel case icing proverbial cake . good quality swivel mechanism appears potential last long time , something prior holsters failed . i also like magnetic closure , which snaps closed securely quickly once i place my pearl into case , without need finding snap fitting . my older blackberries cases which , after use , their entries obstructed flaps fold over causing me use " two-handed " method nesting my phone , one hand move flap out way , other insert phone into case . this very frustrating occurence since i am usually attempting more-preferred " one-handed " approach . although still relatively new , my new case appears no such appendage which might later date become worn tired thereby causing obstruction . before i purchased my leather swivel case , i looked 3rd party generic cases . each these unable " notify " my blackberry it its holster . my new swivel case , soon i insert my pearl , display shuts off thereby extending battery life . addition , this feature allows different profiles selected when my bb holstered or not . also , since this oem case , it made especially my pearl . when holsetered , both usb connector , earphone outlets volume control buttons all accessible . non-oem cases , order use hands free device or charge my phone , i might remove phone its case . i am little disappointed pearl came no case all . this probably due its small size your ability just slip phone into your shirt pocket , unlike prior blackberry devices . course , still exposes vulnerable display significant scratch-potential . they should least provided simple pouch , which would provide some protection . this course comment pearl itself not swivel case , which subject this review . all-in-all , i highly recommend this case those you who still wear your phones your belt ... since i'm it , i love my pearl	1
though still not quite enough battery juice-sucking , it worlds better than included battery . i would love see clip back attach original battery well swap when extended one dies	1
i really like this case ! it easy put take off . it not stupid plastic cover over screen . it not add lot bulk my phone i think it makes my phone easier hold . i would like more colors . i would really like something glow dark , so i could find it easier black hole my purse .	1
believe it or not , i consider going blackjack treo 680 upgrade . i guess whole battery problem depends usage person . my battery problem i cant kill darn thing ! i am one those people depletes battery completely before recharging it . i it my laptop my ipod pda i before blackjack , tungsten 2e . devoted palm users absolutely dispise windows mobile 5 available blackjacks . mainly because you not create edit word , excel or pdf files biggest problem me its complete depndence outlook . which i absolutley not put up . even contacts wouldn't backup ! needless say , treo 680 saved me . if you go way blackjack without outlook , look into sbsh programs facade papyrus . however , if you go lovely treo check out " dialbyphoto " i think coolest part how you set up " favorite 5 " like tmobile offers but still all reliability cingular	1
i've my treo month heavily use it many applications , i especially love goodlink email application , my family videos , mp3 , pics , all my office documents touch finger . yes battery life goes quickly but i don't mind charging my treo every nigh t.t he slick slim design real eye catcher feel great hand . [ ... ] one month usage , my treo hung , one time , simple reset fixed it hasn't hung since	1
i think this would work better " money " type clip . however , since verizon doesn't carry anything like this clear , this works	1
bought this replace my three-year-old cell phone ancient but still working palm iiic . my observations after 30 days ownership : 1 . setup time consuming but unavoidable . patience required . i've couple questions i asked cingular , only forwarded palm , only forwarded microsoft , then back cingular . it seems no customer service department really mastered this unit . 2 . soft reset every once while . unit turns off sound itself only way i've found fix it soft reset . 3 . i'm not crazy microsoft outlook calendar compared palm . i miss several palm features , like " go " " today " buttons . outlook calendar just isn't easy manuever palm . 4 . phone listening volume low , especially when unit protective case , which puts it little further your ear . 5 . love bluetooth option . it new me it just great . 6 . love able press picture make call . we five kids ; i each kid picture linked their phone number . even my technology-challenged husband call them simply pressing their picture . 7 . this phone talks ! female voice announces who calling when your next appointment . first time she spoke it scared me death . voice reminds me computer star trek -- but not clear . however , after getting used her accent , she intelligible , which means computer translating my written input into spoken words -- amazing ! 8 . internet connection limited use me . i don't need email run i could live without this extra monthly cost . most traditional internet web sites take much too long load display too small portion page useful . it nice check weather or get directions go . 9 . can't imagine watching movie or any complex video this tiny screen . what point ? 10 . splurged sweet little vaja leather case wonderful . very expensive , but terrific luxury . 11 . amazon prices best far this product ! saved over $300 off my local retail cingular dealer . 12 . best part : i no longer carry pda cell phone ! they one same ! 13 . conclusion : this phone very smart fun use , although it comes big learning curve . low volume issue could problem someone bad hearing	1
i work university my contract due 2 months ago . i decided get this phone because my pda already old i needed something would efficient . i got this smartphone almost 2 months ago i just good things say it . first , it not heavy last model ( 650 ) also looks really cool . second , interface pretty easy use figure it out . phone microsoft os based ( i used palm device before ) so getting use it took me couple days but not really big issue . battery works really well , spite other reviews , life pretty great , even when compared my last phone ( motorola ) . general , i thinks pretty good buy you cannot beat price when cingular sells it way more money than amazon . i'll definetively buy this website again	1

my husband i just recently upgraded this phone . we going got i560 but got great deal these . so far so good . i switched i730 . what difference ! it seems lighter . it fits my pocket better . other always came unclipped when i stood up , falling ground . i like sound quality better also . screen little bigger than i730 also . front screen caller id seems little dark area charge it little harder get to(that plastic still gets way ! ) those only negatives so far . i really like buttons i760 . since my husband switching old i90 he loves it ! hope this helps purchasing . also if you no service you use these walkie talkies . we haven't tried yet	1

this holster provides good protection device sturdy swivel clip your belt . flap secured magnet making it easy remove device . it just what you want it	1
darn thing broke almost immediately . when i tried switch gel covers ( it comes 3 different sizes ) entire earpiece came off my hands ! what flimsy piece crap . i just sent it back amazon . i'm never buying jabra product again	-1
t-mobile worst customer services . sometimes , it company mistake they still blame it customer . since i started my plan , i problem reciving my bill time . so , company start charging me $5 late fee four consecutive months . also , when i tried adding additional features such their text-message-bundle , change account not take effect till two days later , i charged 10 cents each message i used these two days , it costed me additional $4 . every time i tried complaining their customer services , they just wouldn't listen . i am starting get feeling they just trying maximize their profit . more than once , if i stay long-enough line , they put me mute so they don't listen my complaining . i feeling i am treated like dirt not like customer . i worst customer-services experience t-mobile . also , reception not best country . i friends who using same phone one i but different network , they getting services places where i don't it , they pay same amount money	-1
this deal too good true . course i wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here , but least i expected them all work . i don't know if i got bad earbud or what , but it adds static noise therefore cannot used . case i didn't need , but it fit well looks decently constructed . power adapter seems work fine . so basically i spent $9.99 am only using power adapter . i guess that good enough deal . i think i'll go spend some extra money get brand name earbud/headset though	1
this headset not compatible nokia e62 ! nokia e62 2.5 mm headphone jack not pop port shown this accessory .	-1

i bought this because my current battery would die after 5 15 minutes talk time full charge ( after sitting closet year ) . i thrilled get battery would make my mobile phone truly mobile again . i opened it up , put it my phone , tried close battery cover it would not close . not even close . if i forced it really hard i could get it just close over latch , but it actually bending plastic phone latch would probably danger popping off any momen t.t he battery 50% thicker than standard battery motorola v60 . might great extra battery life , but bad if you can't get get battery cover your phone . i give it two stars because battery may work fine all i know , but it won't fit v60	1

i've my headset month now . noted reviewer , this headset not come any buttons or switches - only thing cord shirt clip . 6 different ear gels included accomodate different ears , which nice ( though i've only ever used one ) . headset very easy slip into my ear ( only takes 1 second ) comfortable up 2 hours wear ( which point my ear starts get little sore ) . my boyfriend reported similar experience other headsets use ear gels . if you regularly stay phone longer than 2 hours , it something keep mind . however , it suits my needs just fine , low price , i think it really great buy	1
these very good not expensive . you buy these staples they charge $5 more . i agree public exchange needed . if anyone knows one , you please post information here . we'll all appreciate it ! anybody want trade extras	1
i've using this phone net10 service since march , say i am very happy it . coverage areas great . i don't use cell phone very often , so this most economical way me go . although phone doesn't all bells whistles like other phones .... it gets job	1
product compact convenient , but it feels flimsy . hotsync function stopped working bit but restored after i hard reset my palm tx -- so it not cable problem but problem my tx . some reason , cable won't let me charge using usb wall-charger i got my wife ipod , but it charge tx off my computer usb port ( which powerbook g4 -- notorious underpowered )	1
title says it all : fits great , great price ! real leather fits like glove	1
i recently got 8525 i loved it first mainly because multi functions it could . however eventually i found out phone part this pda not great my previous camera phone . my friends complain they hear lot outside noise while talking . phone ear-volume quite low i constantly put it max it if i am noisy places . pros : software : windows applications - word , excel , media player . plus : ability create office documents play games hardware : micro sd slot - sandisk card cost me 20 bucks . wireless internet : you could connect this device any wireless unsecure network get internet . i dont data plan cingular but i connect internet home through my wifi home network . if iam coffee shop i could connect their secure network get internet free . cons : * bit bulky carry around . * camera not expected . view finder sloppy cannot capture images low light . * battery needs charged every second day ( depends usage ) but even light use i charge it every other day . best suitable : * internet savvy people who move . * email messaging . * pocket pc . * listen music ( need purchase micro-sd card)accessories : boxwave leather case ($30)leather case boxwave fits pretty good protects device . only problem after you put this case , phone volume needs set max , even after you wont able hear other person so well . but boxwaver case could opened half way folded over . bluetooththis device works very well blue tooth . bottom line : if you ok minor inconveniences while using phone this you .	1
my v180 through cingular - i never dropped call reception excellent . long battery life , very easy menus/wayfinding small size . no frills like mp3 player or camera however - just very good phone	1

k790a currently best " cybershot " camera phone sony ericsson lineup ( but more way ) also hands-down best camera phone u.s. today . it too bad se doesn't sell their 5mp 6mp camera phones stateside . but k790a very capable digital camera . sure , it only 3mp , but like many professionals tell you , pixel count only one thing . this 3mp camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5mp 6mp cameras vivitar , aptech ( sp ? ) , samsung other offbrand companies . my main phone sanyo m1 2mp i thought it pretty good camera phone , but when i got k790a use my prepaid sim card , i simply blown away quality . ( course , i bought phone exactly because i heard great things its picture quality , but results still far exceeded my high expectations . ) camera very easy use . i don't care mms features because my prepaid service ( speak out wireless ) doesn't support them . i just download them my pc using usb card reader . i wish there optical zoom ( more more camera phones japan , including models casio , now optical zoom ) but truth course if you need serious picture-taking you still use real digital camera . but this comes real close replacing your workhorse digicam . i'll use this year upgrade se next gen next year , hopefully then they'll released optical zoom-equipped phones . summary , this great camera . oh , phone functions fine , too . reception pretty good t-mobile + cingular networks ( used speak out wireless ) . voice clear loud . really good . 5 stars	1
this case what it supposed ... it protects your palm treo phone . it very nice looking durable . only negative comment i make case occasionally memory card gets ejected when taking phone out case due snug fit . why i gave it 4/5 . amazon best price case it well worth price	1
i bought my v360 ebay it sold unlocked/unbranded it quad-band variety . here my take : pros :-d urability ; this thing built clumsy mind ( like me ) . i must dropped this thing dozen times there barely scratch . -mp3 player ; i agree onboard 5mb memory joke , but cost transhflash memory coming down ( i bought my 512mb chip ebay $7.99 ) then upgrading easy affordable . said , mp3 player feature you actually use , sound quality good . i've no problem playing my itunes music ( long they're mp3 format no greater 192kbps quality then it play fine . ) ** media player defaults wma itunes defaults m4a formats - you need convert them mp3 or change default either program rip mp3 format ( you change default mp3 settings menu)-programmable " smart keys " ; i read where one user complained camera button not side , it camera icon button front keypad . he must not known you reprogram all smart buttons " personalize " menu . not only , but you rearrange menu buttons program most buttons face frequently used apps . it handy little feature . -built bluetooth edge technology . you may not use these features out-of-the box , but they're time when these technologies more commonplace . i use my bluetooth my wireless headset syncing adding files ( mp3 , pics , etc ) my phone my laptop . -quad-band world phone capable . this phone works 850 , 900 , 1800 , 1900 gsm networks ( although not personally tested ) . however , i traveling micronesia uk within year i'll know certain then . cons:-there slight delay when you answer call - i usually say " hello " 2-3 times or wait few seconds before i begin speak . i don't know if this carrier problem or phone . ( i use cingular prepaid ) . -the light stays while charging ( even when phone powered off ) . it annoying . -the onboard memory joke . you really need upgrade memory if you want anything extra phone . -it monochrome outer display ( full color inside ) . this doesn't bother me all , but it not flashy razr or other phones . overall : this great , durable little phone handy features i think people actually use . i've read where people complain picture quality - but that what digital camera . if you want good quality cell phone that well designed , user friendly , doesn't look like tricked-out teenager phone , then this phone you .	1

i wondered if " snap " concept would feel look secure . it . it rock solid looks like it part phone . additionally , extra protection it provides little screen wonderful . i'd love buy more colors when/if they become available	1
works just fine ! delivery earlier than predicted . i am well satisfied . i looked everywhere two towns buy such simple thing but they didn't them . i told " they order one " . i thought myself ....... so what , so i . this much easier . i ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas it came right my door ---- no muss , no fuss . this way buy such items ! thanks great job	1
i gave this four stars because `jacket ' adds significant bulk weight sansa product . what once slim , sleek product now rather large , rubberized item . plus side , this jacket definitely protects mp3 ; it very solid , covers item completely securely . they included belt clip , screen cover very hard not easily scratched . buttons around wheel far easier press now . i wish there other color choices , but over all i'm very pleased product . before it covered i reluctant put my purse or pocket fear breakage scratches screen , but now i feel very safe carrying sansa taking it anywhere i go . highly recommended product	1
after reading reviews here this case , i thought i'd take plunge try it . cases i'd seen stores fairly cheesey , although they cheaper . this wonderful case . materials first-rate fit perfect . i highly recommend this case	1

first , let me say i really wanted like this device . i patience understanding while but it got me nowhere . main issue this phone its operating system : windows mobile 5.0 . this os piece fluff garbage . simple things should take click or two become so difficult access you basically just give up . main gripes ----------- connectivity t-mobile horrible : accessing aim function doesn't work 9 times out 10 . e-mail functions useless . i tried finding solution hours best i got my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after . internet explorer never find page i'm looking consistently tells me try again . even when connected wi-fi this happens . let me tell you also this device not let you choose wi-fi edge . if you already opened ie you using edge then it continue use edge unless you restart phone wi-fi enabled . calls ----- making call so difficult i wanted smash phone daily basis . usually , i would press talk dial call it would immediately say " call ended . " it if device doesn't even want try . also , when answering call , well trying answer call , it would drop it soon i pressed talk . what hell !? what good phone if you can't make or receive calls ? keep mind this happens around half time . also keep mind i live new york city ! my calls should not dropping except when i'm subway . side volume button extremely annoying causing volume go both extremes within one conversation . not only , but when you disable it , you no other method changing volume device . arggghhh ! keyboard ------- while keyboard basically easy type , phone buggy . first off , t9 sucks ! it completely change word you typing word that its dictionary while you're typing ! extremely frustrating ! now get this , you can't even permanently keep t9 off . so you keep going into menu change it normal abc mode . while i appreciate ability faster typing , isn't whole point qwerty able type without using t9 ? when you actually get typing , sometimes , keys " stick " character continuously repeat until you stop it . this isn't physical keyboard issue but yet software issue . programs ------- all you techno oriented people out there ( basically everyone buying this phone ) , programs this device available download minuscule . not only catalog programs extremely limited but when using java program ( which most programs coded ) dash java program not allow you open those programs . i always get error stating " java midlet not responding " it then gives me choice waiting or killing app . neither which solve anything . this phone so useless it beyond words . i could go it issues but i really don't care . stay away this phone ! while t-mobile customer support very helpful friendly , their service/coverage non-existent . calls constantly dropped , i get voice mails without phone even ringing , internet connectivity never really available . please , yourself favor wait iphone .	1
worked good few months .. then battery started draining fast . now after just 1 or 2 calls battery dead .	1

this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1

i really like my lg vx4400 phone even though there lots cooler phones out now . i've used it 3 years really like it basic functionality . battery lasted 3 years until recently that pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or low-battery life . i'm hoping it'll last 2 more years before i get new phone catch up modern world	1

there many good reviews 8525 positive features most fairly accurate . lots good features 8525 . my intent document some shortcomings 8525 windows mobile os hope ms htc heed correct future . i am business user who wanted combine my hp ipaq 1945 my motorola v550 cell phone into one device . i use motorola h700 headset my old devices 8525 . my overall assessment ; replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted me accepting some compromises i don't think necessary terms functionality ease use . all features i describe below earlier windows mobile os used my ipaq 1945 or my motorola flip phone . if readers find there way perform any deficiencies i describe please let me know . my suggestions rough order priority : 1 ) blue tooth headsets . blue tooth audio should always come through blue tooth headset regardless pda volume setting . hear my voice commands repeated , i turn annoying sound pda , so when i voice dial via my blue tooth headset , i hear my voice commands repeated back . i am referring standard voice dial comes 8525 . one quick solution would tie bt headset phone volume setting rather than pda . even nicer would upgrade allows full audio " voicecommand " software ( this documented many other reviews ) . nice feature my motorola cell phone soon bt detected phone volume changed vibrate audio if it set vibrate . it changed back original audio setting after turning off bt headset . 1a ) if i request voice dial via my blue tooth headset screen should always display voice dial page . instead initial " owner info " page stays up you can't see name screen unless you reach down tap screen . not desirable when driving . if you didn't set pda its annoying noise level you can't hear name you requested either . 2 ) need able control pda phone volume independently audio , vibrate or off . example need able tie turn up phone volume while keeping pda volume setting off or vibrate . 3 ) need able program how long display stays . i am constantly groping find power button side keep display it turns off when i need see something . 4 ) i would buy non bluetooth headset if one available long drives when my bt headset battery dead . only solution i see 8525 stereo headphones turning speaker which little noisy listeners while driving freeway . 5 ) provide built way make ptt comm manager , ie quick key buttons programmable . i would use them many other functions ; such ptt bringing up volume control so i change it vibrate audio speaker ( need able select speaker here see below ) . 6 ) give me way press external button toggle speaker off . i can't easily push speaker icon my fingers . suggestion . add radio button volume control allows you select speaker phone . yes you select phone speaker soft button , but often display gone blank keypad showing . turning speaker on/off should easier . 7 ) provide option save email attachments storage card . my ipaq windows os allowed me capture lots attachments without running out memory . 8 ) remember filter setting i selected tasks . if i filtered task category during session remember filter i selected . currently i so many tasks there 5 second delay bring them all up 9 ) give me way turn off internet browser quick key ( or make this button programmable ) i am always close browser because it gets hit/selected10 ) let me edit/paste one step notes , word , task notes etc . ipaq " edit " bottom . 8525 os you must select menu , then edit , then copy . keep edit bottom . question : there key keypad select cntrl copy like what pc ( letters underlined menu , but i don't see cntrl key keypad ? 11 ) allow trackwheel scroll up icons top then use nav button move across icons ( might way allow external way set audio volume)12 ) if i power off device it remember my input selection . example i select " letter recognizer " . but i must reset each time i power 8525 off .	1
