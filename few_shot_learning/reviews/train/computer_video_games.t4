i purchased this product my niece , positive experiences similar items , finding price too tempting . however , what hope introducing her videogames my generation turned into exercise frustration outse t.t he screw battery casing stripped very little application screwdriver , titles suffered redundancy , many them required use too many buttons . what most disappointing aspect this item potential it possessed ; perhaps fewer similar titles re-configuration button commands would ensure promise this product	-1
i loved first xenosaga . then , this arrived . episode 2 isen't bad game terms story , intro absolutely dynamite . then you get into battle . now , if you like tactical stuff , this good game you . but if you're trying fight your way through hoard enemies get save point record timing , i say save your money . gone amazingly well-done battle system first episode . its place stands completely out-of-nowhere new way battling takes 15 minutes get rid couple easy enemies ( easy ones this game around 2000 hps ) . ridiculous , but that not all . enemies weak " zones " depend height attack you inpu t.t he zones , , highest . triangle = , square = circle = -sometimes- . see what i mean ? it completely screwed-up you become deeplyaddicted game understand its full potential . if wasn't enough , they changed voice actors too . kos-mos voice sounds more like operator than robot momo sounds like brat . least , chaos ' voice improved . i'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this . i just hope namco comes out better sequel , otherwise spend your moey something else ( like shadow hearts , example ) .	-1
driving physics unrealistic they get . obtaining licenses extremely difficult , made worse poor car physics . your heavy car easily bounces off light cars , while light cars easily derail your heavy car . turning steering wheel only slightly produces heavy tire squeal , that sports tires ! long gone espn-like replays gt 2 . some reason cars look thinner than before . analog tachometer reduced just bar across screen . 3d mechanics headache prone , made worse poor physics cars . easily most inadequate music ever . game makes you start used model only certain makes , which nothing new . however , it takes long time earn any money better car . only 7 horsepower upgrades make huge differences track ?! game mostly only newer models , almost none few years ago , unlike gt 2 . only good thing this game you don't drive all time . b-spec driving mode win races you . just leave few minutes return victory screen . this help skipping painful , early parts game . powertrain still not modifiable . compression , bore , stroke , camshaft timing/overlap , valve size , other engine characteristics still not available . poor driving physics , engine modification would not helped this game . loading times very long , most annoying loading indicator ever . constant auto saving feature quick but become annoying . there excessive amount confirmation screens . this game yet disappointment , much like gt 3 . makers this game made it quite clear if you want know what real cars drive like , you drive them real . gran tourismo series over , unlikely return what they used . i'm not racing game fan , but only gt 2 good enough me buy . if you want good , car make-independent physics , you need play gran tourismo 2 .	-1

i extremely devoted smb fan since very first time i laid eyes it . i own all them , so when i stood line all night saturday ( through sunday morning , 8am ) , i made sure grab myself copy smb : banana blitz my brand new wii . i bought entire set controllers , anticipating mini-game fun all my friends . ( we're huge smb fans , all us . it always makes appearance our parties . ) but now i'm really angry . they completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s ) , hitting monkey target worst all . i honestly say i don't care there 50 freakin mini-games , because now monkey target completely worthless . instead amazingly subtle game play bonus items , increasingly difficult levels , magnets , velcro , double bonuses , wind speed direction , all-import ramp run-off you ... cannon , one level , no wind or wind direction , no bonuses , no special items . who cares if i sort pilot submarine single level ? monkey squash -- no joy there . lot controls mini-games terrible . so , so forth . new mini games suck almost unilaterally , but gosh darn , there 50 them ! but volume not make up lack quality . i love traditional smb levels ones smb : banana blitz nice . graphics beautiful fun . but best part game me my friends , now gone dead . none reviews i'd read mentioned fact this favorite most smb players killed like this , if they , i certainly wouldn't wasted my $50 plus tax . if sega people reading this : bring back monkey target . that what people play parties when they're slightly drunk sick listening super smash brothers , way too awake enjoy mario party	-1

" hey kids , fire up xbox lets watch this movie ! " what heard through households own xbox but some reason or they still 90 don't already dvd player . like my title suggests , if you already dvd player , this waste money . only reason i purchased one because my dvd player problems playing some dvd-r i got friend . i some money burn so i just wanted see if xbox dvd kit could play it determine if dvd bad burn or it just my dvd player . i found xbox able play dvd-r question no problem . however , aside those two dvd-r , all dvd i own bought retail stores , so i really no need play dvd-r , my dvd player plays normal discs perfectly . said , i only used xbox dvd playback kit once watch dvd-r i problems . because content these burned " movies " , there really no need watch them again ....... however if push comes shove i always use one my pc or mac watch burned dvd ; no need use my xbox . i meant return dvd kit next day , but never got around it . xbox dvd player good feature , but fact microsoft charges you use feature makes it not worth money ..... unless course you don't dvd player all .	-1
i'm going start this review saying i came wii lifetime pc-only gamer . i never felt need buy console until wii its fun controller system came out . aspect i most excited controlling first person shooters just precisely intuitively mouse keyboard , together added entertainment using it other motion-activated actions within game ( rowing , throwing grenades , close combat , etc ) . result , after spending night out cold get my console , flushed excitement seeing all merchandise , i grabbed three games : zelda ( no-brainer ) , trauma center , call duty 3 . those three titles , i'm sorry say cod 3 one leave bitter taste my mouth . i stated before , i am pc gamer ; i'm really into my hobby , love satisfaction building pc which manage all latest games . i played cod 1 2 pc , greatly enjoyed both . far biggest problem wii version , however , especially someone accustomed playing computer , graphical shortcomings title . i literally no idea what going . i could barely tell which direction enemies coming only reason why i going right direction because linear construction most levels . added this , i no idea how get rid first german engage me hand hand combat ( much advertised feature , which actually just interactive cut-scene ) . i followed instructions wave my controllers around wildly , although i worked myself into frenzy ( causing my dogs panic think something really attacking me ) inevitable german ( i tried throwing all my grenades into room he hides ) kept clubbing me death . even beyond this setback , i found controls often quite poorly implemented . it also disappointing ( yet speaks volumes ) grenade ' throwing ' function involves you actually ' throwing ' nunchuck ( without letting go , way , unless you've got backup tv ) disabled default ; trying use it usually gets you miss your target/get cut down/ blow yourself up . record , i know wii controller works . i've played many hours other games already ( system conveniently informs you ) . this just seems like shoddy implementation it . i definitely tell you there lot ambition here convey frenzy war , some obvious strong attempts creating absorbing combat scenes . nevertheless , it essentially boils down messy soup blurry pixels which , even my gameplay-over-graphics mentality buying wii , blocks enjoyability this title . honest , it made me think ww2 isn't best-suited area wii . after all , these historical titles tend rely great deal cinematically portraying visceral splendor war , rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements . my advice fps front : wait wii ' far cry ' game see how turns out . meantime , there countless hours other great titles more suited wii graphics waiting your attention . before leaving you , i'd just like clarify thing : this perspective someone who very little experience consoles . perhaps you're reaction game very different if you come wii straight gamecube instead pc/high definition gaming . oh , if you're still determined buy it , keep eye out my used copy game ; i'm going need money ' banana blitz ' ..	-1

before i even final fantasy vii , i ordered this game . i loved game , thought ' say , if final fantasy vii this good , then viii must even better!' , boy i wrong ! i'm not bashing final fantasy viii , i kind liked game , but there big problems it . first all , draw system kind hard , but i liked it , it change pace , but way you equip summon gfs ( guardian force ) hard boring . music game reminds me music movie ' akira ' , which bad thing , characters battle remind me crash dummies , way you get new weapons making them junk shops ! not only , but characters not very likeable . main characters : squall- member seed , he jerk everybody . zell-a member seed , he surfer dude dunce . quistis-a teacher member seed , she seems like squall ... one reason or ... seifer- squall rival , he even worse then squall . rinoa- member ' owls ' , square soft ran out ideas , she just like aeris . selphie- member seed , she weird character i sad see her kingdom hearts . laguna- galbadian soldier . he best charecter game . irvine-a member seed , he lady man recycled later final fantasy ix better charecter known zidane . this game second worst final fantasy game ever made . story great , but playing it so bad its almost unbelivable . if square soft remade this game ps2 or psp , i would buy it , but only if they removed draw system	-1

downloading objects fan sites hit or miss -- i many collections i've downloaded work incorrectly or not work all next expansion pack , items i really liked suddenly unavailable . so , i looking forward " stuff " pack maxis . bah . yes , there several very nice items , but really , this underwhelming collection whole . items very limited collections small . pictures you see cover good portion what contained . like so many here remarked , money spent not equal value received . reviewer pointed out what title " glamour life " implies -- jewelry , house items , luxurious textures floors walls , clothing all ages , most all , excess abundance . there no abundance here . i've found items i like , but i am not impressed collection . maxis knows its target audience always hungry new items , i think it taking advantage fact , fooling us into thinking we getting much more than we actually recieve our money . i feel little cheated . if you must this , wait until price drops , or -- better yet -- find good , reputable fan site ( there some very good ones out there safe downloads ) download small fee or free	-1
i reading 8000-word review dave jeanclerc , i strongly disagree some his points . ( p.s. my review nothing xbox 360 version , which , apparently , awesome . ) i playing ea football games since mid-90 , i'm sick paying $50 same game every year . ea games owns rights college nfl teams , so you won't see any football games any other game companies , most noteably , sega , who revolutionized football simulation games late 80 . ncaa football 07 basically same ncaa football 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 05 06 . each year , ea adds little tweak mix , but overall , it same look , same feel , same moves , same everything . this year , they've changed way you kick ball , added more defensive audibles--that it . there few other minor adjustments , but none worth noting imo . fact , audibles they added exact same audibles you used sega espn football 2005 -- you call audibles individual defensive players . thieves . everything else exact same 05 06 . most disappointing thing , graphically speaking , crowd ... it still looks like flat rows objects moving unison , just like it games made 10 years ag o.o -- one other big change ... " improved " momentum meter . if you thought it ridiculous last year , wait til you play ncaa 07 . " momentum meter " such strong influence game , if you make one offensive mistake beginning game , you're doomed ... that it . you can't win . example -- i played fsu vs . um twice . first time , i made no 1st half errors , pounded hurricanes 31-10 . i played same exact settings same stadium again , purposely fumbled opening kickoff , giving hurricanes ball my 35 yd . line , i lost game 45-24 . fumble my only mistake game . nessler , herbstriet corso still making same exact in-game comments they saying 05 06 ... gimme break !!!! also , ai still atrocious . defensively , computer controlled team hapless . they blitz every down . fact , i've lined up numerous times 3rd long 4 or 5 receivers , defense continually loads 8 men box ... they don't even put enough db out there stop me . it basically game long bombs . if you choose team good receivers , you easily throw 400+ yards game continually going deep . safeties always blitz !!! safeties only drop back into coverage if you 3rd 20+ , or 4th 15+ . so how computer couteract your deep balls ? easy -- when momentum meter swings against your favor , your receivers drop every ball you throw them , ( even if you hit them chest ball ) when you finally decide run ball , your running back fumbles ball immediately . i played game usc cal , i kept switching play team didn't momentum , i ended up turning ball over every possession . you may reading this saying , " hey -- this guy played this game lot figure all this out . " no , not really--it exactly how i've played 05 06 game , same " glitches " i've encountered them , too . ea really dropped ball again . you paying $50 get updated rosters , , typical ea fashion , you don't even names any players -- just different skill levels . ea games suck . their soccer games horrible , their basketball games too slow awkward , they don't update their football games . i guarantee you madden 07 same madden 06 ... just watch . way -- ea gone all-out xbox 360 editions ncaa 07 ans madden 07 ... i'm sure those versions stunning . rest us paying same price last year game	-1
overall impression game made rush . assuming " good " alignment , you win simply building expensive buildings edge your influence zone burning enemy platoons sent very unintelligent ai . since winning requires no strategy , game challenging ; you basically same all levels . races against which one fights pretty much same except their " skins " building aspect . defeating them all takes you most 8 hours gameplay . unlike previous version bw , there no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features . cinematics creature apart , it looks like very primitive first version " age empires " .	-1
i high hopes this game but i disapointed . controls horrible definately voice acting throughout 90% bad . story line basically typical , it really didn't hold my interest long . i beat game because i spent $50 it day it came out i figured i would least . i gave game friend mine after i beat it he same opinion i . it worth renting but definately not worth buying . hopefully those who decide buy or rent this game devote good bit time trying learn controls	-1
this game great design excellent/fun story but it obviously not fully tested before it released pc . whenever there more than 5 enemies screen game horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues . this means bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly commands . clipping so bad sometimes i just wanted find ceo activision shove this game down his throat . this fun game , just don't play pc version . borrow someone xbox play version . this example greedy developer rushing pc port market without bothering make sure it worked right	-1

i've fan these games since first one - secrets kill - came out . i've played them all . i'm not all sure what happened games , though . while graphics steadily improved , puzzles , plot , gameplay really gone downhill . first game , " secrets kill " pretty horrific graphics , but story compelling there some fabulous puzzles it . things really picked up second game , " stay tuned danger " . better graphics very interesting story , very cool puzzles , great plot . i absolutely recommend games 2 ( stay tuned danger ) , 3 ( message haunted mansion ) , 4 ( treasure royal tower ) , 5 ( final scene ) , 6 ( secret scarlet hand ) , 7 ( ghost dogs moon lake ) , 9 ( danger deception island ) , 10 ( secret shadow ranch ) . these games similar length interesting puzzles . lots areas where you snoop around - which i really enjoy . game #8 ( haunted carousel ) interesting wonderful graphics , but awfully short . i not all enjoy #11 ( curse blackmoor manor ) i found it way too difficult . i also cannot really recommend #12 ( secret old clock ) . it too short repetitive . i somewhat enjoy #13 ( last train blue moon canyon ) #14 ( danger design ) but they nowhere near quality earlier games terms plot or puzzles . now , we #15 . outstanding graphics , but way too short . amount repetition puzzles order advance drove me completely crazy . i don't mind nancy running doing errands help people ( , i thought games 3 4 it perfectly balanced ) . but i like each task different interesting . not mind-numbingly repetitive boring . this seems factor more recent games - delivering telegrams game #12 , painting pictures game #14 , now finding seashells making necklaces this game . i miss looking clues . putting together evidence purpose . i miss puzzles actually woven into fabric plot there advance game . it seems like repetition now might so it said this game took number hours complete . i also miss learning useful things . #1 , i learned american sign languagein #3 , i learned chinese symbols san francisco earthquakein #4 , i learned latitude longitude how sextant worksin #6 , i learned so much maya how work ham radioin #7 , i learned roman numerals prohibitionin #8 , i learned how make invisible writing ! #9 , i learned how work ham radio pacific northwest sea animalsafter , well , i didn't really learn very much anything useful any later games . if you've never played nancy drew game , please , please , please yourself favor start one earlier games ( although probably not very first one - graphics aren't good switching discs highly annoying ) . but give #2 - 9 try ; you won't disappointed ! oh please , her interactive , please go back way they used structured . i'd gladly sacrifice some improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot , cohesion , or integrated , interesting puzzles .	-1
pretty much sums up how i felt after 15 minutes introductory waffle , hellishly annoying bingy bongy music ( admittedly very pretty ) cut scenes , totally emotionless voice overs , impossibly slow conversations served little or no point . honest point it either switch off psp or throw it against wall . i decided switch it off . now i'm big fan adventure games , played untold legends 1 till it gave up me ( literally left hanging around nothing no more quests offer ) . what i gather , game graphics valkyrie ( after 15 minutes [ though it seemed like much longer ]) i'd seen some really cool character graphics - bit like tekken dr in-game graphics - some those horrible 2d munchkin japanese rpg graphics , which in-game stuff . so bit you play looks like it 20 years old should gba , cutscenes nice but there no doubt far too many those - ie : 5 minutes slow cut scenes every encounter . i can't say this proper review i couldn't stand this title long enough get any actual gameplay there no way i'm sitting through intro again . my advice , if you like long winded old style walk-and-talk three hours before actually doing anything , japanese rpgs . get this ( or better still go antiques shop find old text adventure ) . if you prefer game where you actually play character stuff - avoid this like plague . i've got high hopes dungeon siege when it comes out ( but then i high hopes valkyrie too :-( ) , but now untold legends 2 okay , not good it should but helluva lot more fun than valkyrie . i would like point out i've never played ps2 , xbox or game cube - so this first time i've seen valkyrie profile game . i didn't any preconceptions , obviously if i i'd never gone anywhere near this title first place :-)	-1
me , this game seriously disappointing . so disappointing , i didn't finish second case before setting it down forever . i highly entertained - first . it cute , funny , going around clicking things new ds user highly entertaining . however , it quickly got older . 1 . you can't skip through horrendously long dialog - ever . even after you've heard it million times because you're clicking people hopelessly frustration unable figure out what . 2 . i found myself looking internet walk through , yes , this simplistic game . i couldn't figure out what click wandering around hopelessly thirty minutes reading over dialog you've read thousand times just gets too frustrating even my typical patience level . 3 . possible spolier - there seemed glich second story which i talked wrong person wrong time then i could never get ticket into planetarium . after , i just couldn't take it any more gave up . 4 . places people never change . each case , my understanding , it all exact same tiny few places . i'm not big gamer , but i like world bigger than three feet . i let friend borrow it thus far she enjoying it more than me . just help this review - i'm college-age female this my first gaming console , although i've played ps2 quite bit . maybe it really hit or miss but i don't really recommend it anyone but someone high patience level . really high patience level	-1

remember all those countless super hero licensed beat ' em up plagued 16-bit systems ? first glance ea marvel nemesis : rise imperfects might not seem like type game , but make no mistake it : repetitive quickly boring beat ' em up host technical issues . you play variety marvel comics heroes villains , well six " imperfects " : cyborg-esque warriors created specifically game . single player mode ungodly repetitive you battle hordes generically created enemies . this gets boring real quick , button mashing galore repetitive gameplay . destructable environments seem like good plus first , but you'll soon learn how much they actually work against you brawl , it becomes more frustrating than it should . cumbersome control scheme adds this , not mention controls get quite buggy well . graphics look sharp distance , but game odd look it like it doesn't know if it wants look like spider-man 2 or ultimate spider-man ( both great games much more worth your time than this ) , game cut scenes look godawful . there few saving graces which save marvel nemesis complete clunker , including horde unlockable content comic fans love . marvel heroes ' super powers nicely pulled off , including storm weather attacks daredevil agility , online support where most fun game . other than though , there not much else here hold your interest . if you're looking great super hero game , check out x-men legends series or aforementioned ultimate spider-man . if you're looking great beat ' em up , check out rockstar warriors ; all which more worthwhile than this	-1

hey , you ever played caesar ii 1990s ? yeah , well this game basically knock-off game better graphics . quite frankly , caesar ii more fun . i don't see how civcity any point . you build your city nothing interesting ever happens . there no progression game keeps it fresh . makers intergrated technologies wonders successful civilization game series , but they inconsequential this game . these people should stick what they good , civilization series , leave city games people who know how it . i've heard new installment caesar series out now , caesar iv , i haven't tried it , but it better than civcity rome . this game boring , don't pay any money it .	-1
like other reviews , i find this game rip-off caesare iii . ( i didn't know there iv ! must look into . ) while graphics admirable , gameplay wasn't challenging all . it didn't take me any time all win , i'm one worst game players ever . otoh , it good afternoon waster if all you want build perfect your city open play no goals . don't buy it now . wait until it cheap , like $9.95 or something .	-1
playing icewind dale ii reminds me all those novels written american authors late 19th century . though many novels very well written , they never seemed suck me continue reading book . icewind dale ii like . it looks nice , it supposedly improves gameplay , it gives player more character creation options , but i just don't really want play it . why ? well , end day , it seems if icewind dale ii hurt extremely corny story ; it bogged down numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly ; it just not fun its predescessor . i bought this game one reason reason i addicted baldur gate ii needed expand my party based rpg addiction realm . icewind dale ii seemed logical option . i wrong . i immediately confronted story so corny it almost embarassing take part . i confronted gameplay caused me run back forth one place constantly . i confronted battles so easy i soon bored . i tried play it again , but again i plagued same problems . i installed bunch unofficial patches , but those not solve problems terrible puzzles whatever else . overload puzzles corniness would ok if you could diverge one path you could baldur gate ii , where you could accomplish quests order you wanted . here you accomplish everything linear order could never diverge path . furthermore , story seemed retread story original icewind dale . fact , design game seemed paralell it completely . final problem this game concerns fact it difficult play if you no knowledge dungeons dragons rules . if you not know how use rogues or unfamiliar feats like , this game pose very high learning curve you may not want climb . i mostly familiar rules , but it easy see someone who not know them well could easily make mistakes or unfamiliar use certain classes ( even though rule book pretty exhaustive ) . all all , i not think this good game . i would just go baldur gate ii or icewind dale i instead this game .	-1

bought this platinum game much anticipation it doesn't work all . tried download . exe patch nothing top it off half original game forum sites crash too . no one any idea how fix this game all you look dozen patches out first game . if they spent time money build game test it right like blizzard companies like westwood then they would release finished game but decided use everyone gunea pigs test product so they could try patch it work . not buy anything this company or its affiliates i think they alkida implants trying take over western world . if you want play game style then wait until june get " titan quest " which should finally diablo 3 . too bad this company couldn't find capital complete game before release would think anyone wanting buy spellforce 2 should warned upfront make sure you wait 6 months after release buy additional hard drive so you download new patch fixes they probably try smoke screen you they count their money send it iran	-1

it got some occasionally interesting puzzles , but lame story irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might . good : unique challenging puzzles ; handy hint system helps keep game moving . bad : some worst voice acting you ever hear ; blurry , low-res backgrounds ; dull characters uninteresting story	-1
i purchased this game when it new , my computer while meeting requirements just couldn't run it . i put he game box just month ago found it again . computer i now should able run game thrice simultaneously all options highest settings . yet game randomly crash cause my computer restart losing my 4mins 2 hours work . i contacted tech support got what i am now sure just something me try until i quit trying leave them alone . it worked . they win . they got my money i got jack	-1
i always fan fighting games . far 3d ones go , i great experience dead or alive series proficiency soul calibur 2 . i fear dead or alive soul calibur may spoiled me though . recently i bought mortal kombat deception found it horribly awkward * compared fluid battles soul calibur or dead or alive . i felt same way when i played tekken 5 . unlike graceful awesome animations dead or alive or soul calibur , movements characters tekken 5 unrealistic absurd . try out christie tekken 5 example . her idle animation preposterous . if you access dead or alive 3 , try putting out leifang . her idle animation thing beauty . every one her moves flows perfectly one next . this kind grace seriously lacking clunky tekken 5 . now let us speak character design . tekken 5 characters boring uninspired . they run gamut miscellaneous boxer 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , miscellaneous karate fighter 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . oh . there also few shrieky girls tight clothing , some which seem asian , if that your thing . then there guy cat mask . awesome sounds , it looks silly game . if you ever played practice mode dead or alive you probably recall fondness there feature shows each move command top screen keeps it there until you successfully perform move . this feature , useful it , not present tekken 5 . fair , it isn't found any other fighting game i played , but it really should . without further ado , let me simply say i not recommend buying tekken 5 if you ever played soul calibur or dead or alive . intro video much excitement game offer ( i especially enjoyed suicidal bicycle girl rescued kitten ) . * but least mortal kombat deception puzzle kombat , which rocked my socks	-1
i really liked first two jak games , so i excited try jak 3 . whoa . major mistake . this game nothing more than lame racing-wannabe . i very disappointed this game . if you expecting platformer , look elsewhere	-1
how many rpg this world make ?? they're all same . open this container , take weapons health kits this dead body , use this spell .. kotor no different , sadly . combat imho just really boring . when you see enemy , screen freezes you decide ahead time your first moves make . if doesn't kill enemy , your character automatically standard attacks unless you pause game set up your next moves . umm , how many times this before ? if i wanted , i could bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're now . all enjoyment taken out using things like blaster rifles light sabers . it same idea using your shovel or something nethack ( look it up ) . good thing games like everquest world warcraft they took stale old rpg formula something new it .	-1
i am huge spyro fan , i playing since first one , which great , second one better , third one , ok , forth one what happened !! this one , after purchasing mine amazon cheaply something like 5 i regret doing so , it waste money seen whole game bit repetative frustrating , you never seem get anywhere . all voices changed . if you series gamer enjoyed origional spyro games , dont buy this dont disapointed . however i would say if you under 12 you would probably very much enjoy game	-1
this game came highly recommended people who generally similar taste games me , but i'm still trying figure out why . there no question in-game graphics impressive story-line interesting . however gameplay nearly non-existant , when you happen participate some action controls either badly executed or unnecessarily complicated ( i.e. sphere grid or blitzball ) . even story often poorly told , stilted voices hilariously bad character animation . if i compare this game some squaresoft other efforts , it similar mix final fantasy 8 chrono cross . but while those two games generally frowned upon rpg enthusiasts , final fantsy recieved almost universal praise . short , i'm not so much disappointed game i am baffled its warm reception .	-1
first thing-the graphics far prettier than any current 3 caesar games out there . said tha t-t his game major bug right release . how possible ? it unreasonable expect u.s. company produce flawless product ? probably not , but tilted mill some best pros industry . basic bugs killed any enjoyment me scenario editor unworkable mess . advice offered techno weenies forums beyond comprehension average consumer . far better go civcity 3	-1
please sid -- dissapointment civiv , now railroads , say you haven't jumped " easy " bandwagon like so many other game designers . sid -- reason we purchase these games because your name them . this game seems like it made 12 year old , not someone who grown up complexities you normally build into your games . please -- next game you release , make sure it lives up standards you created . after this , just throwing your name game no longer means you print some money your bank account	-1
sid meier reputation unblemished after civil war series , civilization original releases railroad tycoon . but this game release major setback make me hesitate any future products carrying his name . this major derailment . it fastest i ever firmly known new game removed my hard drive . take look how many used copies already flooding market this game just released less than two weeks ago . every aspect made into chewing gum where you used steak . there no expansion , tweak , or update fix how seriously dumbed down this version	-1
seriously .... i waiting quite awhile this game come out because its predecessor freakin sweet . it all i use play online . after purchasing this game playing it all 10 minutes i quietly put it back box not taken it out since . online play non existent . everytime i clicked game it said it didnt exist . it ridiculus . letting someone else create this game instead infinity ward giant mistake . this latest edition adds nothing series . not purchase this game .... there many better games out there	-1

said earlier review creators final fantasy giving us everything but what we actually asked . they gave us advent children , cell phone games , finally dirge cerberus . this game action based game showing you day life most under-used least interesting character final fantasy series . its creators way telling us they never re-make final fantasy vii but rather insult us every marketing ploy know man	-1
no way change inputs your tv . dvd functions tv functions accessed alternatly pressing " tv " button but there no way tell which romote aligned . therefore when you press power button you no idea which you powering on/off , tv or xbox . if things couldn't get any dumber , if you press eject button while remote tv mode it doesn't work . eject button only designed work xbox yet it disabled when tv mode ? there also no option program receiver . many others mentioned , this remote looks nice but people who designed it must drunk . not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money garbage	-1

if you looking xbox vertsion chapter mechwarrior series , this isn't it . this extemely dumbed-down version mw . even if you ( mechwarrior fans ) forget no customization , remember this : you only fire one weapon time . you cycle lazers , cannons rockets . i bored after 5 minutes . again , people who never played mw series may like this game better	-1
this game good concept , nice graphics , some definitely funny moments , but gameplay total bore . there two main gameplay styles : " investigation " " trial " . investigation worst ; it involves nothing more than checking everything room , talking everyone , ton pointless reading , much like old point-and-click adventure pc . court sections little better , but not much . once again , it very linear ; you don't use your brain much , just try all options . once again , there huge amount reading . there way too much dialogue packed into game , not near enough actual gameplay . most talking aimless , too ; very little it actually advances plot . overall , this game just tried way too hard good plot characters , left player little more than click objects scroll through text	-1
you get few outfits some new furniture but not lot . all free stuff out there download sims , stuff pack not very worth it . maxi just milking franchise every penny	-1
this pack offered very little anything . decor ( very little it ) uninspired . i hoping get some good artwork least . i know lot people don't like download fan sites but don't waste your money this junk . believe me fansites much better more creative stuff your sims most it free , none it cost much this glamour life stuff pack . this first last stuff pack i ever buy	-1
when i first played this game , i got bored 10 minutes . all you shoot kill people nothing , police chase you you shoot them , bring girls into your car it them . i dont recommend this game all its overrated	-1
typical xbox game using checkpoints instead creativity make it challenging . nothing more mind numbing than doing same thing over over again because you keep getting killed right before next checkpoint . granted , you get hours hours playing time it , but only 25% something you haven't already 10 times before . i highly recommend this game people who intellect enjoy working production lines where they same thing repeatedly . if your brain actually requires some kind stimulation , find more creative game . addition , some actions tend bit uncooperative times , such when attempting knock someone out but instead you just stand there waiting get shot . apparently if you aren't facing just perfect position when attempting smash his brains out , you stand there like manakin hoping guy two inches front you doesn't notice . option try shoot him , but unless you get head shot , expect fire gobs rounds take him out since you seem armed what only . 22 short pistol	-1
games such grand theft auto : san andreas , driv3r , true crime , etc . competition fierce game like this won't cut it . first when max talks it sounds like he mumbling second graphics suck third game just sucks general i am so glad i got this used $6 i bet it returned because it too dumb previous owner . i saw it eb games only $5 must mean it sucks i read rockstar game rights remedy because sales sequel max payne 2 so low i no clue how this made " greatest hit " play gta or true crime instea	-1
starsky hutch fan since i kid , i looking forward playing this . graphics quot ; cartoonquot ; horrible need quot ; vrquot ; points becomes annoying after awhile . bad guys like something chinese kung fu movie , you shoot them accurately it takes all day kill them ... that playing ps2 gun ( i can't imagine shooting controller ) which makes you lose mission because you down quot ; vrquot ; points . dialog gets annoying too you can't skip hearing it either	-1
i plugged receiver into my game controller followed directions get controller communicate receiver . receiver light kept blinking which means it didn't recognize controller . after several tries i decided product defective returned it	-1
pointless quests no real conclusions . ctd every 30-45 minutes . lengthy dialoge no real human attachment . all all very unpolished product , even patch . if your favorite aspect first game story then not buy this game	-1
i bought this game when it $50 because i thought it would great game . i wrong . you dont get lightsabre until far into game all advertisments shows you lightsabre . game extremely buggy poor graphics . i am huge starwars fan would not reccomend this game anyone no matter how big starwars fan they . dont buy this game	-1
sure , graphics sound nice , but this game very linear very forgiving- too forgiving . you save reload just constantly , so long there aren't monsters nearby things made kinda dummy-proof so you can't make any significant mistakes . result , i never really felt like i taking much chance doing anything . dialogue mostly matter clicking responses until you can't click anymore there not much bad consequence clicking them any ol ' order . there really only one path through different areas game nothing ever respawns . you also adjust difficulty levels very easy very difficult but experience treasure don't adjust accordingly . this means if fight too tough after couple reloads you make it very easy still get same rewards you would gotten when it hard . lt ; yawngt ; maybe i'm just little jaded playing online games like everquest so long . online , realtime games other humans playing around you there much more unpredictable , more importantly uncontrolable , much more exciting environment play . i got so bored this i actually stopped playing while close completing very last area game . i just didn't care anymore . this game requires very little thinking or strategizing	-1

i've fan these games since first one - secrets kill - came out . i've played them all . i'm not all sure what happened games , though . while graphics steadily improved , puzzles , plot , gameplay really gone downhill . first game , " secrets kill " pretty horrific graphics , but story compelling there some fabulous puzzles it . things really picked up second game , " stay tuned danger " . better graphics very interesting story , very cool puzzles , great plot . i absolutely recommend games 2 ( stay tuned danger ) , 3 ( message haunted mansion ) , 4 ( treasure royal tower ) , 5 ( final scene ) , 6 ( secret scarlet hand ) , 7 ( ghost dogs moon lake ) , 9 ( danger deception island ) , 10 ( secret shadow ranch ) . these games similar length interesting puzzles . lots areas where you snoop around - which i really enjoy . game #8 ( haunted carousel ) interesting wonderful graphics , but awfully short . i not all enjoy #11 ( curse blackmoor manor ) i found it way too difficult . i also cannot really recommend #12 ( secret old clock ) . it too short repetitive . i somewhat enjoy #13 ( last train blue moon canyon ) #14 ( danger design ) but they nowhere near quality earlier games terms plot or puzzles . now , we #15 . outstanding graphics , but way too short . amount repetition puzzles order advance drove me completely crazy . i don't mind nancy running doing errands help people ( , i thought games 3 4 it perfectly balanced ) . but i like each task different interesting . not mind-numbingly repetitive boring . this seems factor more recent games - delivering telegrams game #12 , painting pictures game #14 , now finding seashells making necklaces this game . i miss looking clues . putting together evidence purpose . i miss puzzles actually woven into fabric plot there advance game . it seems like repetition now might so it said this game took number hours complete . i also miss learning useful things . #1 , i learned american sign languagein #3 , i learned chinese symbols san francisco earthquakein #4 , i learned latitude longitude how sextant worksin #6 , i learned so much maya how work ham radioin #7 , i learned roman numerals prohibitionin #8 , i learned how make invisible writing ! #9 , i learned how work ham radio pacific northwest sea animalsafter , well , i didn't really learn very much anything useful any later games . if you've never played nancy drew game , please , please , please yourself favor start one earlier games ( although probably not very first one - graphics aren't good switching discs highly annoying ) . but give #2 - 9 try ; you won't disappointed ! oh please , her interactive , please go back way they used structured . i'd gladly sacrifice some improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot , cohesion , or integrated , interesting puzzles .	-1
pretty much sums up how i felt after 15 minutes introductory waffle , hellishly annoying bingy bongy music ( admittedly very pretty ) cut scenes , totally emotionless voice overs , impossibly slow conversations served little or no point . honest point it either switch off psp or throw it against wall . i decided switch it off . now i'm big fan adventure games , played untold legends 1 till it gave up me ( literally left hanging around nothing no more quests offer ) . what i gather , game graphics valkyrie ( after 15 minutes [ though it seemed like much longer ]) i'd seen some really cool character graphics - bit like tekken dr in-game graphics - some those horrible 2d munchkin japanese rpg graphics , which in-game stuff . so bit you play looks like it 20 years old should gba , cutscenes nice but there no doubt far too many those - ie : 5 minutes slow cut scenes every encounter . i can't say this proper review i couldn't stand this title long enough get any actual gameplay there no way i'm sitting through intro again . my advice , if you like long winded old style walk-and-talk three hours before actually doing anything , japanese rpgs . get this ( or better still go antiques shop find old text adventure ) . if you prefer game where you actually play character stuff - avoid this like plague . i've got high hopes dungeon siege when it comes out ( but then i high hopes valkyrie too :-( ) , but now untold legends 2 okay , not good it should but helluva lot more fun than valkyrie . i would like point out i've never played ps2 , xbox or game cube - so this first time i've seen valkyrie profile game . i didn't any preconceptions , obviously if i i'd never gone anywhere near this title first place :-)	-1
i know pelican screen protectors styluses tempting because they're always cheapest ones available . should tell you something . first all , top screen uses adhesive . it smooth plastic middle , but edges leave sticky goo screen . because edge different material than middle , it insanely difficult squeeze air bubbles out it , adhesive , trying again again isn't much option . furthermore , sticky edge white , not clear , it looks horrible my onyx ds lite . after so much difficulty top screen protector , i checked online reviews . i read several reports people who used pelican styluses pelican bottom screen protector screen protector very drastically scratched up within hour worth use . so , whether stylus too harsh bottom screen protector or screen protector too flimsy stylus , combination just doesn't work . many people report simply throwing their pelican write protect sets into trash , so i'm not only one paid pelican money something that going into trash . no matter how inexpensive pelican product , it still too expensive if you end up throwing it trash too . i know i'm going avoid pelican screen protectors styluses future , i very much wish there reviews here amazon before i bought mine . i dig through nintendo ds forums read other peoples ' opinions . finally , if you already bought one hate it , you remove it using scotch tape edges peel it off rubbing alcohol remove residue	-1

this review reference " nancy drew : last train blue moon canyon game + strategy guide " edition . i've played 3 or 4 drew games . this one played faster over before time it took install game . before i installed ' blue moon canyon ' , i installed " morrowind game year edition " , which sold five dollars less than ' blue moon canyon ' . morrowind huge 4 disc game , bare minimum , 400 hours gameplay , possibly might literally endless . entire morrowind set installed up running within 15-20 minutes . after i installed played ' blue moon canyon ' we installed got up running " age mythology gold " also within 20 minutes . this massive game , real time strategy game included expansion pack " titans " . both ' mythology ' games completely installed . this game played explored years . two game set sold five dollars more than ' blue moon canyon ' , or original full retail price strategy guide edition . " last train blue moon canyon " took so long download ... we went out dinner let it download while we gone . we p4 3.2 ghz , 80gb hd , which only 23gb used , 1.5 gb ram . there no reason earth why nancy drew games should take so long , over hour , download ... unless their copy protection program conflicted our toshiba super-multi drive drivers . actual installation not painful download . what painful gameplay . i lot fun playing ' secret old clock ' . whereas most amazon user reviews came across lukewarm game , i liked playing golf game , car chase , " bank shots " reflective light beams aligned . i even felt proud when i finally got sewing completed . i knew drew games wouldn't deliver value two games ( mentioned above ) . but after reading reviews ' blue moon ' i expected more fun than i ' secret ' , even though i knew it would short lived . what let down . game over two or three hours . most gameplay memory test what order what button pushed or stick knocked over , or which way track leaned . ' arcade ' games general store just hit button or this case ' click mouse ' . you didn't even look . most complicated task getting piece paper rubbing . it very boring . price , concern over length download , most unimaginative gameplay set walking back forth train , i cannot recommend this game fun . it few moments math/scale problems but it wasn't enough carry game or balance huge amount needless dialogue player endure listening . i realize i'm adult , but eight year-old little girl ( i bought it ) lost interest after first 15 minutes . she wiser than i . sorry nance , this one waste money , might contribute hardware damage driver conflicts . marf	-1
i bought this game week ago . i not purchased prequil ( sp ? ) this game not know what expect . i began playing game immediately got bored 30-45 minutes later . i no played game since . here why : graphics , me , ridiculously annoying . it makes game feel so unrealistic . graphics step lower than " nba street " even more unrealistic . real problem there just nothing . you enter tournements they all feel same . little side missions laughable , i feel like turning off my ps2 smashing controller my head repetitively everytime i play one them . i go why i hated this game . but i won't . bottom line i strongly urge you not waste your money . cover appearance game appealed me made me want buy game ... but don't let happen you	-1
poor quality , out box you only play kq7 . almost useless very dispointed they even sell this game it	-1
after all hype this game i bought it ... well my opinion it just felt flat its face . game simply not very intersting storyline plain boring . there other rpgs out there better you simply get immersed story line quickly . battles get boring extremely quickly since all you kinda point tap same guys over over . " costumes " " decals " kinda stupid . many said this next earthbound , well not not even close . nintendo ds so much potential this game not deliver graphics , sound , game play fun . dont get me wrong game not horrible any means but defitnetly not good either . check out some reviews out there before you buy it	-1
pros : - mechs bigger part games ( you actually use them ) , - graphics cutscreens great , graphics overall better than before , - couple characters look better , - much harder than episode i , - more optional bosses , cons : - new battle system load mouse spunk ( i say spunk ? ) , - most characters look worse ( especially kos-mos ) , jin travels throughout space no pants , - almost all sidequests terrible , - very short , - story much weaker , - dictionary gone ; so shion glasses , - no shops . why there no shops ? - too much more list . just bad . movie " howard duck " better than this	-1
hey , you ever played caesar ii 1990s ? yeah , well this game basically knock-off game better graphics . quite frankly , caesar ii more fun . i don't see how civcity any point . you build your city nothing interesting ever happens . there no progression game keeps it fresh . makers intergrated technologies wonders successful civilization game series , but they inconsequential this game . these people should stick what they good , civilization series , leave city games people who know how it . i've heard new installment caesar series out now , caesar iv , i haven't tried it , but it better than civcity rome . this game boring , don't pay any money it .	-1
civ name tarnished . analogously , one thing i learning just because sid meier name product , it doesn't mean product good . case civcity : rome , unfortunately , it doesn't just come " modestly good " - it comes " dismally poor . " i've tried hard not let this influence my beliefs civilization general , but after civ4 came out , i am starting believe firaxis games sid meier their way out . now this ... i regret inform great civ titles made long time ago . offerings today simple pattern : production rushed title came out major bugs ; games add unnecessary features designed justify overall cost ; consumers often abused ridiculous expansion packs containing features should obviously included original release - they take advantage our love franchise . this pattern so evident whole sid meier civ franchise degenerating . it almost seems , especially release civcity : rome , we once again expected simply drop cash new products based our love old . but developers not living up our expectations producing great games ! stay away civcity : rome . besides obvious blunders associated all bugs , you see even best patch cannot make graphics look good , narration sound effects better , or interface work properly . game dismal failure , i am sorry report . it seems like firefly studios idea got license firaxis , but they just cheesed it . watching what maxis ( sims simcity franchises ) firaxis ( civilization franchise ) doing their most loyal fans like watching your dad get drunk	-1
like other reviews , i find this game rip-off caesare iii . ( i didn't know there iv ! must look into . ) while graphics admirable , gameplay wasn't challenging all . it didn't take me any time all win , i'm one worst game players ever . otoh , it good afternoon waster if all you want build perfect your city open play no goals . don't buy it now . wait until it cheap , like $9.95 or something .	-1
controls very difficult i understand they wanted " realism " but they killed lot fun making you just so damned vulnerable everything . i'm long-time gamer i handle tough game but this just frustrating extreme . plus all people talking immersion ... i just don't see it . i just couldn't get myself care world or story i ; it didn't grab me like some games	-1
this first wii game i got , its mostly because i couldn't get hold zelda . red steel looks promising . certainly its controls good , but it feels more like game that supposed get you used using remote nunchuck attachment . tutorial sorts . problem it isn't much fun deal . you play scott , man japan his girlfriend . you suddenly find out her father yakuza mob boss he got tons enemies . your girlfriend gets kidnapped so its up you save her , ultimately getting yourself involved this family struggle . it pretty simple stuff . most game told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards . graphic novel storyboards look interesting , but its really painful you can't skip any these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes . this especially annoying when you die you listen same objective over over again . red steel appeal its gameplay , which seems focus game . controls solid , most part , but again , whole game seems like tutorial get used wii remote . you use remote aim enemies button shoot . nunchuck allows you pick up weapons , reload said weapon tip over tables ( you'll know what accessed because it golden outline around it ) . nunchuck also how you'll move around . you strife side side you move forward . nunchuck also allows you jump duck . you'll doing lot ducking . remote responsible most gameplay . it allows you turn one side screen . game itself help you get adjusted tutorial provided beginning game ( your grifriend directing you what fish look ) . you'll able use remote several things . you lock onto enemies button if you hold button you zoom into enemies moving wii remote closer screen , or you zoom out . it all pretty cool , but remote extremely sensitive . just slightest flick left you'll look left . it great actually point shoot enemy , your accuracy really important , but now it all up you whether or not you hit enemy . granted , controls take time get used , but they flow particularly well . swordfights story , though . these annoying sequences actually . mostly because controls clumbsy . you'll swing your sword using wii remote you'll parry dodge attacks using nunchuck . first this fun , but its so limited . when fighting swords you can't pull out weapon . this bad when you're middle firefight some guy sword . you'll forced into sword fight even when all enemies using guns still up . they'll still fire you you'll lose health . there no way back out sword fights either , that also really annoying . controls just feel clumbsy well , especially its extreme sensitivty . gameplay credit , there some interesting things you . starters , when you're not shooting someone you're ducking behind something , your health refills . first this makes game seem easy , but you understand if you're taking damage , or shooting all , your health doesn't refill . so this doesn't make game incredibly easy . also , after sword fight , you'll choice finishing your attacker off or sparing his life . sparing his life earns you respect , which you use learn more techniques . game doesn't look fantastic , but it not bad looking either . it visual presentation alright , but part graphics lacks games numerous bugs glitches . there moments where you'll staring enemy right face he won't move . won't flinch or even attack you . he just stands there waiting killed . sometimes enemies run right past you or claim they can't see you when you're plain sight . there also moments where i shot enemy back neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence . there probably more bugs than this found within game , but it hard take after while . there couple other annoying aspects gameplay well . you only hold two weapons time . this isn't annoying it sounds , but i wish i could've held more . luckily , ammo not hard come all . there also glitches such your bullets passing right through enemy while he takes you out . enemies shooting through walls . this game just full them . i wish i could say it sounds good , but it doesn't . voice acting very mediocre soundtrack isn't great either . some levels sound good , but there nothing memorable here . red steel good control scheme going it but that really all it going it . it not fantastic game any means . bugs glitches strewn throughout also just really annoying . it hard recommend this game , even die hard first person shooter fans . good+the control scheme works+well , there lots actionthe bad-tons bugs glitches found throughout whole game : enemies who don't attack , or walk right past you . enemies who can't see you plain sight . bullets going through walls or through your enemies ... this game full them they detract gameplay-sword fighting clumbsy-you only wield two weapons once . -when you're forced into sword fight , there no way you get out it until fight over-horrible voice acting-there really no story i t-t he controls , while good , just seem like ploy get one used wii remot	-1
lack balance ... if one thing could pointed problem , it lack balance . battle system good attempt it sounded great paper but it just didn't pan out . mentioned , number enemies speed enemies took away battle . also , monotony enemies left me wanting . during one area game , sandsea , i chain 164 , i wasn't trying get chain points , either . no matter how good battle system designed , 164 same enemy , row , gets boring . license system seemed more like dumbed down version sphere grid ffx . i loved sphere grid , wasn't so fond this system . obtaining experience through battle increase your abilities would made this success , requiring abilities also bought made it failure . level 20 , penelope cleared magick section grid , although , her highest level magick use cura ... hardly impressive skill . storyline like riding snail . too many cut-scenes not enough interesting developments . gil distribution down-right ridiculous . leveling up hours , exploring every nook-and-cranny dungeon , still not enough money improve your weapons ... there just wasn't good balance . there needs healthy dose risk reward keep it interesting , past games , leveling up just fun progressing story ... it felt like necessary chore ffxii . nearly every enemy i remember , you got 1 license point per kill . rough estimation , 1800 enemies would need killed clear one section licensing system . last rant character classes , or lack . any character anything you want carry any weapon you want ( necessary price ) . while openness good , it makes rather boring characters excitement getting new skills class completely lost . after all , so what if vaan gets new axe when basche right behind ( note : i mentioned weapon ... there no special abilities unique any character , either ) . lack rewards , gil , ability increases experience , monotony battles , i would not recommend this game . i put 20 hours into game completely lost interest midway through hunt ( mini-games bland rewards completing hunt nothing get excited , comparable defeating difficult enemy previous ff games ) . i believe you make decision whether you enjoy this game rental . naturally , person may like everything i ranted above . like any ff game , you hate learning curve previous few hours then become addicted ... i lost interest middle addiction-stage	-1

i loved " incredibles , " so i excited play game . i've only playing video games last couple years , only off , so i'm really just beginner . perhaps explains enormous difficulty i've this game . my boyfriend long-time video game player , he able things one or two tries i labored hours over . even using cheat codes not really help me all much . i surprised when i read review said game too easy . i almost cried . lol but seriously , unless you good gamer , you're probably going more frustrated than challenged this game . me , i guess i'll stick action rpgs	-1
i gave it one star because there no way give it less . this game when played box great . so when it came out pc i bought it . big mistake ! control too hard learn . when you battle you can't stop think which keys when used together work . there too many keys you need push together even simplest thing . i wasted my money this game . i deleted it never play it . don't waste your money	-1
there nothing majorly wrong this game . plot well-developed , characters customizable , battles strategic . this probably primarily subjective , but i just didn't enjoy this game . it not because there too many movies--it because i didn't like movie . i also didn't like characters or villains or matter aesthetics . there some minor but annoying flaws game which further contributed my displeasure . which button press often counterintuitive , so i often found myself pressing wrong button . also , game badly needs journal and/or destination guide so you know where go -- i once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around space ship trying figure out where go	-1
i bought this game because it sounded like lot fun . i tried installing it my dell laptop no dice . it would not run . i tried installing it my dell desktop computer again , it would not run . when i went knowledge base , technical support lists if you integrated video card , game not work your system . short , if you " over counter " system , you cannot run this game your computer . i find this ridiculous disappointing . i would not suggest buying this game until you go their technical support page go over all requirements game play . especially since these little facts not listed box	-1
i actually recieved this friend mine , which he bought $0.98 . anyway , i said there television shows i thought interesting , but only sold over uk ( so ) . he told me ar max region dvd reader . so , i took it home , decided buying tv series region 2 , just recieved it today , my surprise ( not actually ) damn thing didn't work . now i'm stuck region 2 dvd nothing play it . i am extremely disappointed this product ! if you buying this reason it reads other regions dvd ... don't buy this product ! it junk . however , i am thankful i didn't even buy this product , but it given me . i hope someone planning buying this , reads my review first . it not worth your money	-1

i'll brief : first all : out 81 reviews this product currently amazon , 31 1-star . should tell you something . pros : when it actually works , it /does/ cool down your 360 . cons : 1 ) crashingcaused more crashes than it prevented . running without nyko instantly reduced number crashes freezing problems i . 2 ) loud hellturn your 360 . put hairdryer next it , turn it , low . step back sit where you normally play . how loud this product make your 360.3 ) hard set up , frequently stops working . it took lot playing around just get it work first time . it snap fits well back 360 , but despite , there some impossible magic angles tightness power connector ... we're talking millimeter tolerances here . if you're off just tiny bit , it won't work all , xbox won't even power . this wouldn't too bad if you only go through this headache once , but no : it loose enough you risk disconnecting it ( setting it up all over again ) every time you touch power cord or move 360.4 ) many people reported this unit causing actual damage their 360s . you better replacement plan your 360 handy , never mention nyko when you try rma your box . if you let it slip , you probably won't covered . that it nyko . i returned mine within 2 weeks . i've searching good cooler 360 since i got one . unfortunately , it my opinion there no good coolers 360 market . fan-stands ( yes , i've bought returned them ) decent coolers , but require you run your 360 vertically , which big no-no . number websites shown 360 dvd-rom drive eat your dvds games when it vertical . i hoped this overexaggerated , but then problems started happening me ... i'ver personally seen what appears damage my /mint/ condition games when running 360 vertically . i also experienced frequent game-loading problems ( including hideous slowdowns ) games like halo 2 ( where you actually see progress bar ) when played vertical 360 ( it worked just fine it horizontally ) . so , horizontal way go . end , i ended up building my own cooler out some old ( still loud , but much quieter ) computer fans 12 volt adapter , slapped it side . works well , probably cools well nyko , but without noise or crashing ! your best bet , if you can't something like , just buy little clip fan ( its own power adapter ) it blow into right side/bottom ( vents away dvd drive ) your 360	-1
first all , it sad someone would put out product ( 360 ) gets so hot it tends fry itself , unless you spend 10% product cost little series fans . second , i attached this . i plugged it . it wouldn't even turn . waste money . yourself favor just keep your machine open , uncluttered , unblocked area . if you absolutely must provide additional airflow , just point $10 clip-on fan it	-1
this game joke ! it immpossible child get past level 3 . it took my husband 20 tries get past it , he pro video games .

if you're looking spend money this , don't . spent my teen years holed up my bedroom commodore 64 ( current fan i am ) , i really excited when i heard this product . unfortunately , it stinks . there couple games this contraption real gems , rest mediocre best . overall bad choice games isn't my issue this thing though . it crummy joystick . control horrible . stick clunky unresponsive makes playing real chore . someone else pointed out their review , often it doesn't even respond when pushed certain direction . i can't believe it 2006 yet these companies releasing plug-n-play video game contraptions can't even make decent joystick ! real letdown	-1
i really excited when i saw this item out ! i commodore 64 when i kid , my brother i used spend hours hours playing games it . i so glad see winter games summer games included .... until item arrived i plugged it tried play it .. joystick doesn't work all when you move it right . so , you only use it go up down or left . big dissapointment . don't waste your $$	-1

i extremely devoted smb fan since very first time i laid eyes it . i own all them , so when i stood line all night saturday ( through sunday morning , 8am ) , i made sure grab myself copy smb : banana blitz my brand new wii . i bought entire set controllers , anticipating mini-game fun all my friends . ( we're huge smb fans , all us . it always makes appearance our parties . ) but now i'm really angry . they completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s ) , hitting monkey target worst all . i honestly say i don't care there 50 freakin mini-games , because now monkey target completely worthless . instead amazingly subtle game play bonus items , increasingly difficult levels , magnets , velcro , double bonuses , wind speed direction , all-import ramp run-off you ... cannon , one level , no wind or wind direction , no bonuses , no special items . who cares if i sort pilot submarine single level ? monkey squash -- no joy there . lot controls mini-games terrible . so , so forth . new mini games suck almost unilaterally , but gosh darn , there 50 them ! but volume not make up lack quality . i love traditional smb levels ones smb : banana blitz nice . graphics beautiful fun . but best part game me my friends , now gone dead . none reviews i'd read mentioned fact this favorite most smb players killed like this , if they , i certainly wouldn't wasted my $50 plus tax . if sega people reading this : bring back monkey target . that what people play parties when they're slightly drunk sick listening super smash brothers , way too awake enjoy mario party	-1
how many rpg this world make ?? they're all same . open this container , take weapons health kits this dead body , use this spell .. kotor no different , sadly . combat imho just really boring . when you see enemy , screen freezes you decide ahead time your first moves make . if doesn't kill enemy , your character automatically standard attacks unless you pause game set up your next moves . umm , how many times this before ? if i wanted , i could bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're now . all enjoyment taken out using things like blaster rifles light sabers . it same idea using your shovel or something nethack ( look it up ) . good thing games like everquest world warcraft they took stale old rpg formula something new it .	-1
my only experience this product after i opened it , started play dvd my xbox , when i tried pause it , it didn't work , it brand new batteries . i found ( after much frustration ) if i smacked it against my hand few times then it would work 2 minutes . i took it back exchange hopes it just bad unit , but it sold out so i just got my money back . you buy dvd player not much more than this way overpriced piece junk costs	-1
i bought this because two dino crisis games playstation 1 fantastic survival horror fun , i very taken hype around this game which billed it lightgun game free roaming rather than rails . what they didn't say it almost impossible use ps2 gun fully functioning controller , which what you really need . anything but shooting , all buttons you need really inconvenient places all around gun after half hour play time , i take break rest my aching joints . case you haven't seen it , g-con2 gun teeny-weeny directional pad back it , it this you expected use move yourself around . now , if you try holding gun standard " aiming " style , you'll soon realise your fingers nowhere near right position able reach it . you could just hold gun wrongly reach it , but you need able fire screen regularly kill dinosaurs . they don't sit still waiting shot ! so most game you need able move fire same time . guess what ? it impossible . bravo , capcom . oh , sorry , they didn't stop there , but added further control scheme allow you strafe . this you need still more fingers so you still press directional pad , two further buttons way down gun barrel same time . able pull trigger . but even that end it - if you want still more pain , try using sniper mode ! you may realised , control scheme completely spoiled gameplay me . i'm not fumble-handed any means , but you would need octopus manage all this . which shame , because free-roaming game shooting dinosaurs very exciting idea . dino stalker otherwise presented very well . graphics very good monsters all look very impressive . some stages really good fun but my favourite ones those when you riding some kind vehicle , which means you don't worry movement all - hooray ! levels where you get chased down tunnel enraged t-rex probably most fun game . rest ruined controls , which make your life hell . i'll tell you something else too - most levels time limit !! case you thought slow careful hunt would save your fingers , this rendered impossibility levels clock counts down zero - so if you don't rush through stage , it game over you . kind negates joy free-roaming , doesn't it ? you basically stuck dashing point point , killing everything moves ... might well rails . i don't know why this stupid condition added , dino stalker not created arcade game . it real waste potential , but it only fitting dino stalker miserable failure after release . if you buy it , you only yourself blame . i managed finish it - final stage volcanic pit actually pretty good fun , but this other bosses towards end endurance tests caused me agonising hand cramps get through . save yourself - i made it through so i could come here tell you you don't . could great game , but it all went wrong due impossible way you expected able use gun .	-1
i haven't even got play it yet because game not work my ps2 . after ps2 logo comes up , screen goes blank nothing happens . i thought it maybe just disc , but i exchanged it same thing happened . i called ubisoft they said many people slim ps2 called say it doesn't work , but they don't any answers . sony said it error format discs , it may not work many ps2 . not buy if you don't want risk it not working !!!!	-1

ok first all let me say yes this mic nice look feel it .. also wireless it adds its attractivness but over all this mic after long time wearing it really hurt your ear .... it becomes very uncomfortable wear even given me headaches , how me friend needed headset we both bought one ... i no longer use this headset while my freind no choice till he gets his 360 also , this day he constantly say " hold up im switching my mic my other ear cause this ear starting hurt " 360 controller headset wireless it becoming more availible just wait cause end this headset isnt worth price it wont compatible your 360	-1
i bought this game whim , really liked need speed : hot pursuit 2 . this game needs help . first all , frame rate lower than it should . there slow-down well . even game before this , need speed : underground 2 looked 100 times better . car models most wanted touch nicer-looking there far better selection than underground 2 , but that only plus this game it . you don't race much fly around city barely-controlled frenzy , trying stay ahead computer cars . winning more luck than skill . he or she who hits least obstacles wins . hardly enjoyable way race ! i get too stressed when playing this game , so i put it away while . definitely rent before buying this game .	-1

this game such sorry state i don't even know where begin . first all , this not all what i expected what i wanted . sid known very complex simulations i preordered this game only because i saw his name game designer . alas , game most dumbed down train simulation i ever seen . looks like sid jumped " easy , fast easy " bandwagon . second , game , best , barely out beta - little more useful less destructive than , say , computer virus . i experience frequent crashes ai often builds ridiculous tracks . finally , aware game one worst copy protection systems i ever seen , which interferes other applications . instance , game won't launch while i run skype . selling game such unfinished state shows lack ethics disrespect customer . shame you , firaxis sid meier .	-1
i'd like give this game good review , but unless you read fine print , you may dissapointed i discover it doesn't work lcd televisions . it also incompatible rear projection plasma television sets	-1
man ! what f#$%ing deal companies handing over their biggest game franchises second third party developers ??? haven't they ever heard old saying , " dance one brought you ??? " this game horrible , if you say otherwise you're bad need therapy because you're so desperate video game you've convinced yourself this worthy your time . or maybe your time truly worthless ... which case you should contemplate drastic measures . first off , game very linear . " call duty 2 " truly felt like open battlefield , whereas this one feels like ride disneyland . sure scenery beefed up beautiful , but how those character animations ? mouths aren't synched dialogue , they mindless hand-waving thing when they talk ... just like all cinematics back ps1 n64 . ai horrible . call duty 2 you couldn't just hold your crosshairs same spot wait idiot german pop up same place so you could plug him . this one you --- but you just don't care . also --- " it glitcheriffic ! " i shot german he flew straight up into air , completely off top screen ! i snuck up behind german hit him melee attack ---- friggin ' dude two front flips flew like twenty yards . mind you , he standing position entire time . not unlike tossing action figure across yard . this game left stale taste my mouth , really just pissed me off . call duty 2 360 only killer app . if nothing else these people need realize once you great game --- all we really want gamers great big expansion pack ! they could've added 12 more hours additional content call duty 2 campaign missions i would've paid $60 , cash barrelhead son . way go jacka@ @es . ..	-1
gameplay overall feel this game screams castlevania . sidescrolling platform action spot , graphics truly push limits ds , variety equipment/soul combinations lend itself perfectly creating gameplay experience perfect your style play . people said past reviews , use touch screen feels tacked . defeat bosses you draw symbols screen , which frustrating if ) you poor penmenship , or ) left-handed ( such yours truly ) scramble take stylus out , switch it your other hand , draw symbol . it neat little addition but , again , it didn't really need there . also , boss battles sometimes little too easy , even later levels . don't get me wrong , there some just downright nasty , but some bosses fire off their special weapon all you look screen go " ... that it ? " overall , this great game nintendo ds . exception clunky touch screen addon , game overall fantastic	1

this perhaps best final fantasy games , sadly , most under-appreciated . ix amazing animation backgrounds , beautiful music score , solid gameplay . characters some most delightful series . personally , i think vivi zidane coolest characters ever . lastly , gorgeous cut scenes deliver beautiful epic storyline . sidenote , this game definitely deserves remake . there lot hype final fantasy vii , its own prequel remake coming ps3 . i feel final fantasy ix should remade ps3 . i love story line better than vii , graphics way better , gameplay incredible	1
we've all heard final fantasy 8 final fantasy 10 , but anyone ever mention game ? final fantasy 9 , sadly , most underestimated game final fantasy series . it one pulled me into my ff fandom , though it around 6 years old i still love it . reason it not famous others probably because ff9 came out playstation just before playstation 2 came out . storyline spellbinding -- it captures you right beginning flows beautifully , through cities eternal rain , clashing monsters , ( traditional plot theme almost every rpg alive ! ) fate world itself . everyone relate ff9 characters , who struggle find who they or where they belong end , find , or almost find , meaning stunning finale . then you'll find yourself cheering them ( or mourning over them if you become attached one who dies . ) music ? nobuo , you've outdone yourself . ff9 songs masterpieces , you'll find yourself humming you're not alone or melodies life without knowing it . course , couple pieces bring back amusing scenes just mentioning their name . ( slew love letters , anyone ? )any cons ? hard question . if there problem , then i can't target it . perhaps leveling up your character may take while , but then again that traditional part every ff game so it shouldn't counted . able play few " legendary " characters(fratley , beatrix ) would great , but would take away their status , wouldn't it ? ( that opinion , so i'll let it slide . ) i think this until my head explodes , but i won't able target actual flaw . i , lyrit , find final fantasy 9 perfect rpg game . overall , again , this got greatest ff game out there . i've played most others popular series now , but they just don't strike me like ff9 . wait . what you listening me ? get ff9 play it . once you , my review look like it degrading this game	1
might little misleading -- battle mechanics almost exactly same those first game ( heck , most nippon ichi games , though this series , i think , best lot ) . part game absolutely delivers : - great classes . - good monsters , more consistent class sytem them . - excellent assortment items . - good variety levels . however , far story -- area which hour darkness solid -- this game falls its face . writing iffy , plot itself contrived , characters ( while certainly amusing ) predictable , it just leaves so much desired . if you're looking storyline you get involved , go back first game . if you're it gameplay , though , don't miss this one ! some class tweaks few added features , cursed memories worthy addition those who simply want monotonous level-up madness some us thrive . great 2d art mixed fun environments , hilarious quips item descriptions , engaging fights hundreds hours ( literally ) entertainment	1

i three these logitech wireless controllers now . they all broken nearly seven months day i buy them . problem same every time , left analog stick breaks . my girlfriend got me my first one december 2004 ( christmas ) . it lasted until july 2005 . i exchanged it store , new one lasted until maybe february 2006 . i exchanged it again now my third one just bit dust september 2006 . i am not really heavy gamer . i play madden ncaa 2007 sparingly . i am very disappointed this repeat problem . i also notice " " button sticking issue others refer here . i tried putting little graphite there make it not stick . seemed work while . you really can't beat convenience wireless , every other aspect controller great except durability .	1
i came upon this game demo sony . i downloaded it onto my psp hooked within 5 minutes . i needed full game . don't let child-like voices images steer you clear this game if you older gamer . trust me , you some fun . only thing , i beat it little too fast . still very fun	1
this controller great . you able play games much easier this one than first manifest . this controller should considered better than dual shock because it more comfortable people like me who play games long periods time plus	1
case you havent ' noticed this controller not game . so far controller goes , it works great i not single problem it .	1
i finished almost all final fantasy games . ( ff1 - 10 , 10-2 , ff tactics ) . i would say this ff xii best gameplay final fantasy i ever dream off since my childhood . i summarize follows . 1 . game play : i would rate this 10 stars but here max just 5 . game looks boring first , but once you get party a.i. system ( called gambit game ) , this extremely fun . battle environment superb . looks much like real battle . no battle scene . no random battle . everything appears map . multiple attacks land enemy same time . camera view half-global ( you see everything , if there no obstacle , front , behing , left , right , above , not below though since floor obstacle . ) this like real thing . thing i want see final fantasy ! 2 . graphic : superb . rendered texture looks inferior ff ff x-2 , when these two highest quality cutscene displayed . but over all cut scene better since ff x-2 , there sometimes cutscene looks really bad . i am more satisfied something smoothly good average , not too good cutscene then extremely bad times . 3 . music : superb . thus far , no normal battle music , but not matter . music not so great when you listen separately , but it suits game environment lot . 4 . trivia : town so huge . look like real town . approximately more than 50-100 people you talk each town . costume looks so different . it not just like old series this game where town person town may looks exactly alike town if you notice . but ff xii , you notice meticulously see similarity . overall , everyone looks unique ! thing i would say environment looks much like star wars + lord rings , though i put more emphasis former . if you watch star wars episode i , you see why i think it looks much like star wars . cons : i would say these cons nothing compared pros . 1 . storyline . quite simple . no plot twist thus fat i played . not many things stimulate players want know what happen next . unlike ffx , game introduced many interesting plots beginning gradually unraveled them game proceeded . i would say if you watch only movies cutscene , ffxii sounds like normal battle story middle age . ( but why there so many hi-tech transportation ? )2 . voice . i would say voice actors this game quite disappointing . they good job , i admitted , but their voices doesn't seem sound good . example , compared ff , main female protagonist unique voice , but ff xii sounds like typical american people . second main female protagonist ff sounds unique , but ffxii sounds ok , not so great . main antagonist ff sounds mysteriously great , but ffxii sounds quite dull . only one i think he sounds ok main male protagonist .	1
one might suspect gta : san adreas classic anarchist fun insane driving , guns galore lawless protagonist , linear storyline . let honest though ; nobody buys gta just play mission part fact i hard time getting into missions . san andreas there even larger area gameplay few other cities explore once you advanced game ( unless you want cheat ) . clear aspect sets this game apart previous ones depth gameplay . haircuts tattoos available purchase . you various parts your character built up -- fat , hunger , muscle , driving skill , weapon skill etc . obviously when you get fat you need run around eat when hungry . others self explanatory . some new rather interesting vehicles ave added this game . hydra , which harrier type jet , stunt plane , attack helicopter , four wheeler , parachute , my favorite -- jetpack . other than game like each created before it gta 3 . graphics even fairly modern computer still leave much desired . whatever engine they use clearly same gta 3 . animation other hand very natural realistic . music radio stations lackluster , but i believe it possible use your own music instead . computer game san adreas ' controls very least awkward because sheer number actions . worst case scenario -- hydra -- however using keyboard fly plane downright nerveracking . if you want shoot something below you , sure compensate couple seconds , not because it moves fast but because you need time angle nose plane direction . i , myself use xbox controller which adapter use usb port computer . even it not much better you still need d-pad make decent turns . you tell this my biggest qualm game . overall grand theft auto : san andreas lot offer if you don't regular gaming console but compensated clumsy keyboard controls . i would rate it 7 out 10	1

i bought this game adult birthday party . it hit . game very entertaining it easy navigate through game . you full control settings such music level , vocals , crowd noise , etc . you also change mode traditional karaoke which only words displayed screen . it definitely all ages even my two year old can't get enough it . selection music good . sure memory card so you save any characters you create keep track your performance unlock hidden treasures such extra songs wardrobes	1
this game i would recommend without reservation anyone looking adventure game beautiful , positive , entrancing , funny , inventive , great soundtrack , doesn't involve violence / carnage . i'm 40 completely under spell game weeks weeks . my 6 year old son equally engaged , able complete 40% it without help , himself ( he needed help boss battles , or anything under time pressure ) . you lose hours this game but you won't emerge tense , sore shoulders anxiety or frustration over impossible tasks . same time , it definately not too easy . it just challenging enough . it long thank goodness , because i didn't want it end ! overall tone so positive . you get japanese wolf goddess romping through what detailed , beautifully imagined executed japanese watercolor world . you weapons you take out monsters , but your weapon ink brush , you take out monsters calligraphy strokes . simply brilliant , would make excellent christmas gift adventure game lover	1
okami rates among most beautiful games i've ever seen . main point game you're reincarnation god , awakened after hundred years dispatch evil that overtaken land . entire landscape bleak dead -- affected evil , it your task both fight ultimate evil , restore land using various techniques you learn throughout game . one really interesting aspects game , since main character folk tale diety ( form wolf ) , player affect environment game drawing calligraphy brush . circle stroke sky creates sun turn night into day . stroke across dead tree brings it bursting into full bloom . slashing stroke across your enemies cuts them . my only minor complaint so far perhaps it little too much shepherding terms letting you know where go next . however , this doesn't detract game overall . same time , player good deal freedom -- i haven't felt railroaded through storyline all . perhaps extra guidance make this game more accessible also people who aren't usually gamers . if you're looking something visually interesting , occasionally humorous , very different gameplay usual fare , okami highly recommended .	1

lemony game not hardcore gamers . it doesn't aspire . it shouldn't compared warcraft or resident evil 4 . game developed amaze activision . any one familiar first three harry potter movie o-o rdinated games ( through electronic arts ea games ) familiar amaze . first three potter games fun bit challenge children those adults who new pc gaming . player wandered around magical world hogwarts , collecting jelly beans wizard cards . what fun not completeing tasks or learning new magic , what fun freedom discover new areas find secret places . fans potter games recognize same mechanics gameplay outfitted new location , jelly beans replaced golden eyes , golden hearts refuel stamina instead chocolate frogs , playbills letters granted instead wizard cards . players also recognize flavor wonderful score game set , enjoyable , appropiate , but not overbearing some familiar notes . lemony isn't quite good aforementioned potter games . reason lemony not fun story . while ficticious , lemony story relentless abuse three very droll very wealthy orphans . its much more fun play boy , who left his abusive aunt uncle behind , entering magical world educated hogwarts . i rather enjoyed learning how fly buckbeak prizoner azkaban . lemony , i'm rather relieved i solved train signal puzzle , thought children run over over over train until i , depressing me . yet , lemony provide some consolation those who disappointed ea latest potter offering , goblet fire . while there adjustment droll circumstances , task discovering your world take over game eventually command your attention . while lemony isn't bad , it isn't good , either . they renderings children not most flattering they could , villians boorishly ugly . gameplay controls aren't half good potter games , they weren't greatest . there match game puzzle cellar , only shows up per every install , instead every game . i complete it nothing happened my game , which maybe reason puzzle won't show up rest games particular installation . it this twice me , i'm not going uninstall install third time see if it happens again . it no effect my score or letter or eye collecting . camera angles aren't well mapped shooting . i supposed shoot rat , but camera got behind ceiling lamp , while rat biting me , all i could see inside lamp shade . suff like . still its better than most children games out there , it plays ! you may guessed , there violence . when i shoot rat lemony , it shot rotten egg lobber . rotten eggs your bullets , player stuns enemies , instead killing them . time . i've played lemony three times , third time it going through motions . once few skills jumping , aiming egg lobber , boot puncher mastered , there wasn't any interest left . but time i play , i enjoy it . games amaze category unto themselves . they not action games based trigger finger , nor they point click boring adventure games beset brain teaser puzzles futuristic world . they relaxing time where you don't test your brain , just delight it . if you never played potter games new pc gaming i recommend lemony , it good place start . if you fellow potterhead felt betrayed buy goblet fire , lemony sustain you .	1

your back liberty city ( just like gta 3 ) you cant fly , swim , clime ( just like gta 3 ) no graphics upgrade . no airplanes . glitches like crazy . same psp . but if your looking game just play fun enjoy intresting/funny/good story line than get this . 20 bucks cant go wrong .	1
i never played original don't really want . this game such treasure find it phenomonal music graphics , engrossing gameplay , twisted plot , variety characters possible play . i lost lot sleep over this game i'm not even half way . if anything , it some best show ps2 graphics i seen-something expect square-enix production . wind moving through environments , water trickling , sort-of dream-like haze towns . it all culminates into eye-pleaser if nothing else . but gameplay game engineering also top quality . character designs very diverse many periods time cultures represented . there fairly even mix female male characters well classes like archers , light warriors , mages , ect . menu navigation ability load different game data anytime ( other than combat ) serious perk many take granted . you keep loading game when you don't get einherjar you want until randomized selection gives you perfect group you looking adventure . ability instantly travel any location map without lengthy travel location location keeps pace nice brisk giving you only what you want , buying equipment battles . difficulty right where it needs , if you quick run game , you tough time beating boss . it nice not leveling forced you but rather elective thing so you get through story when you want . battles clever , mixing tactical rpg action making it very engaging actually fun . there degree button mashing , but then again , it not static or boring your turn , my turn , cast spell , drink potion . it actually combat , like it should . i can't praise this game enough ... i don't care how good first , it can't better than this one . this certainly go down best title ps2 . if i any complaints , it would recycled voice-commentary different einherjar fact they really aren't involved main story-line . oh , since they would stupid not make third one , customizable armor would cream crop . vp2 solid offering last ps2 offer	1
i played through first halo really enjoyed single-player campaign . i never played multiplayer game until i bought halo 2 . let get this out way first : halo 2 multiplayer unparalleled . multitude multiplayer games ( capture flag , juggernaut , team vs . team , etc . ) dizzying variety terrains , there plenty keep halo fans busy blowing each other up . addition alien elites playable character spice things up . you also wield two weapons time , one each fist , providing combat option those gunslingers like their battles john woo-style . unfortunately , halo 2 single-player campaign not impressive . whit , alien covenant entire society based idea activating giant rings throughout universe ( known halos ) put them their journey spiritual evolution . reality halo weapon designed destroy flood , infestation aliens who turn human alien alike into vicious zombies . how you keep flood infecting every living thing ? why , utterly destroying every living thing universe course ! play alternates master chief alien elite known arbiter . this gives player both sides story , which interesting ... point . eventually , plot converges enough so two characters should really end up fighting each other . would something , if ai made you play through both battles opposite sides creating enemy uses your own moves . but instead , midway through battle universe , giant plant looks like audrey ii little shop horrors shows up . this planet , speaking jabba-esque guttural tones , rams plot down our throats grabbing arbiter master chief shoving them into opposite plot lines : arbiter ends up working humans , master chief ends up doing alien dirty work . then things really get going , just halo 2 hurtles towards final battle earth ... game ends . i should guessed something up when , during e3 interviews halo 3 , ceo bungee only this say : " you ready finish war ? " what he meant , " you ready finish game you thought you finishing halo 2 ? " you've probably noticed my review second installment pirates caribbean , i really , really , really hate movies games fail provide whole story . it doesn't matter this part two three-part series . writers developers obligation provide full story ; you create story beginning end even though it middle series , evidenced two towers . halo 2 improvement original , but it loses points weak campaign forces you play both sides , then throws talking plant clean up mess .	1
i thoroughly enjoyed playing final fantasy viii . introductory movie i hooked . world story very unique , well new battle system . i thought junction system fairly easy understand once i got used it , i loved it more than materia system vii . characters viii all very likeable . it interesting play game perspective student named squall , who happens one my favorite heroes final fantasy series . cinematics game very nicely produced captured best moments . start finish , i fun playing this game highly recommend it fans final fantasy series role playing games general .	1

pros : - exciting absorbing story line . - great gaming experience . cons : - some minor bugs . - single player game . - cannot replay more than few times	1
quite honestly i think it expected original would better than second especially series such this where you choose what happens plot ( light or dark side ) . first game series such this its easier write plot run smoothly because you clean slate but second game you cant really make it so it runs so smoothly . you make game so it runs smoothly no matter which path you chose first game which i think pretty difficult task . they ok this task but times actual story line quite confusing but overall they ok . i think they better job powers such . you able get lot higher level then you previous game so you received more powers . game not awful any means . i think if you play game knowing its not going live up kotor 1 you enjoy it quite bit more . i recomend you play first kotor before playing this one because then you see series its full potential appreciate it lot more . also know it not going good kotor 1 when you start playing , it helps quite bit	1
despite all controversy over its violent content , grand theft auto series videogames deliver time after time best entertainment bang your buck . my opinion grand theft auto : vice city best game out series so far . yes , missions bit easier than those san andreas , but vice city better overall experience . setting beautiful , there more properties you own , automotive , firearm weapon selections also quite large . soundtrack this game amazing . 80 pop metal old school rap hillarious talk radio , its all here . grand theft auto greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun , challenges , elements real life triumphs consequences one well produced package	1

i'm afl fan while , so i got this game , since it sounded interesting . it not truest sim out there , it more like nfl blitz but indoors . still , it very fun game if you remember 2000 afl season . i would liked seen more these games , each season . least this game satisfy my appetite afl football . i would suggest all afl fans get this game , simply joy it bring you , fact this only repesentation best brand football out there . i just wish other smaller leagues ( like wnba ) would get contract games , since there many fans these lesser known sports would love sim games . go rattlers go pred	1
this game lot fun , you so much dark humor great . only gripe i it just way short easy . i easily beat this game 3 days , i still 2 days left my rental . i would say rent this game , because you easily beat it within week . so overall , here break down pros cons . pros : -playing pranks students -the missions lot fun-the side missions also lot fun , bring more story-good dark comedy , like all other rockstar games-unlocking funny constumes , like black ninja costume stay out past curfew-all different cliques great , able beat up bully anybody lot funcons : -just way too easy , missions beaten very easily . -incredibly short , nothing like grand theft auto games where it take month unlock everything , i able unlock everything 3 days . -would've loved see some same things gta : sa bully . ex : gta : sa you able gang members follow you what you want . it would've great see bully . overall : i would suggest renting , lot fun , but easily beaten , not worth $50	1
just add my 2 cents already glowingly-reviewed title , couple more clues how well-received this game : 1 . after selling through initial stock , capcom stopped shipping copies game . uproar gaming community ensued existing copies started selling 2-3 times srp online auctions before capcom announced they ship more copies . 2 . e3 there trailer revealed phoenix wright sequel ds , which sequel original game japan but titled usa " justice all " . if you up unconventionally written games quirky charm , this fun title sit back , relax laugh .	1
people plz ive my ps2 month after it came out ok i 2 controllers ones i bought day i play least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 5 hours day during school year i never any problems all my cousins thrown these across room wall when they get mad nothing happens these very durable	1
my expertise actually rpg but i've always madden fan so i think my opinion usefull someone wanting know this game . this your classic madden game . very fun , very addictive , very challenging . franchise mode best feature . basically you pick your team then you decide how much pay players order keep under salary cap , which players dump rehire pretty much everything else it takes run team ( which lot things ) . then their online mode where you play players all over country . after you play all other modes this feature keep you entertained clear until next madden game comes out . only problem some online players know how cheat . ea sports strongly denies it possible cheat online , many good players get mad when someone talks cheaters online because good players think people who blame other cheating just sore losers ( which true lot time ) . however , after personally seeing some things my computer nerd brother hack into i think anything possible any website . there ton people out there lot smarter than you me they figure out how cheat anything ! finally only reason made me drop my rating 5 star overall 3 star overall . infamously not so popular superstar mode . super star mode sucks !!!! you retry foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr get pedigree parents you want . top you can't fully get your player high rating all categories make good player ( speed , agility , strenth etc . ) . you improve player stats , but never where you eventually want get them . also , when you finally get agent get you access performance institute it doesn't much good because using performance institue only increases your stat temporarily . but i some good news ! i've heard through grapevine madden 07 this feature greatly improved . you'll able run 40 yard dash so you acually get speed rating higher than lousy 88 . you get bench rep decide your own strength . so least madden 07 you'll more control your player skills . this best thing madden . people who make these madden games must took notes when they learned evolution school . every year madden adapts improves flaws last year game ( much like what football coaches their team real life ) . cool thing they actually take advice their fanbase ( unlike most game companies ) . when madden comes across problem they adapt fix problem . this game probably deserved 4 star overall rating instead 3 star overall rating , but when video game company adds new feature game it better cool . because it really pisses me off if they go through trouble add new feature get us all really excited then new feature ends up beeing stupid .	1
i love this game . i haven't played other ddr games before , so i'm not sure how it compares others , but this one great . some songs i like lot , some i don't , but they're all challenge fun some way . i like use dance master mode which you unlock songs doing well . i haven't made it all far because i play same levels over over again because they're so fun . this game great people all ages , includes music young old .	1
there reason everyone loves this game- there lot exciting action ! popularity this game well-deserved too , because you so many things this game it almost ridiculous . driving around blast , many weapons you use such shovels , baseball bats , golf clubs , pistols shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun revolutionary game . it game you own if you're fan video games .	1
" dude supy " gave this game bad review . " supy " likely 20-years old advanced palette video games . it best suited children 6-12 , like my two children who big fans lemony snicket movie . game follows movie pretty closely , graphics pretty good , if you're not very skilled gamer ( like my 6-year old ) it okay because if you " die " you just restart task . i few technical complaints , but this game definitely lives up my 5-star rating	1
i can't believe someone would try selling memory card more than 25 dollars . you ripped off if you pay more than 10 dollars one , but unfortunately , if you live country like me , finding store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably nearly impossible . so you're forced shop one online . it really not cool pay all this money * just * save progress my video game . it really dumb .	1
this game i purchased my sons . they both told me they enjoyed this game . little tough first but any new game , you your challenges . if you want game not too easy , this one ! fun don't let losing take fun away . it game played it enhence your skills	1
we rented this game my kids play each other . game labeled 1-2 players but made only one player single ps2 console . kids disappointed because now they take turns watching each other . aware	1
this good system great graphics , number good games . supports online multiplayer too xbox live subscription . only problem i system sometimes it freezes . i've it 5 months , it probably frozen 8 or 9 times which annoying esp when im middle game . other than it good system .	1
when i first came home this game tried it , i thought it going kind dumb . but it lots fun kind addicting . i even got my 11yr old son doing some cooking . plus it good price .	1
i recently bought this wheel local game crazy anticipation upcoming release gran turismo 4 so far despite few problems i've satisfied my purchase . good1 . great compatibility ps2 racing titles - it works basically all ps1 ps2 racing games - not just nascar games ( i've using it primarily gran turismo 3)2 . easy control customization . 3 . feels good your hands4 . well madethe bad1 . i wish adjustable lap rest could lock into place ( sometimes it slips back when your taking tough corner)2 . while pedals well made not use them carpeted surface - they slip . ( customize wheel like i , setting gas brake l1 r1 dont even bother pedels unless you better surface them)3 . wheel allows customization it sensitivity but i wish it could get little more sensitive then it ( more life like)overall it good solid purchase if you can't afford drop 150 bucks something top line . it definately alot better then using controller racing game .	1
why mess original . there lot phonies copycat controllers you get discount . you get what you pay . i several standard ones like this they quality . addition controls gamecube similar enough other nintendo products so you won't learn completely new system	1
i put great deal interest my purchases . lot extra down-time work internet connection , i find myself reviewing everything before i buy it . only after i am very impressed convinced many positive reviews i take out my credit card . but this product , microsoft xbox360 media remote , one exception read many bad reviews deciding purchase it anyway . let me tell you ... this remote perfect if ... 1 . you would like one , easy-to-use remote control both basic tv xbox 360 doubles your dvd player . 2 . only buttons you would need tv : channels , volume ( tv speaker/output control only ) , numerical channel input , muting , * intput selection * ( yes , it switch your tv inputs ) , return ( toggle 2 tv channels ) , power . 3 . you not need specialized/advanced buttons found oem remote or advanced learning remote tv . 4 . you not need control a/v receiver , dvd player ( other than xbox 360 ) , or digital cable box ( tivo , dvr , etc . ) 5 . you budget but would still like quality remote . if you say yes all or most , then don't hesitate grab one these remotes . you completely satisfied . especially immediate access tactile dvd buttons versus 360 annoying on-screen dvd navigation . this feature it almost worth $30 alone . . . i also own logitech harmony 880 living room which i highly recommend anyone not fitting into catagory mentioned above	1
half-life made its debut 1998 , it shocked entire world . half-life time featured stunning graphics , gameplay , sound . it simply one those games every gamers hands , still this date half-life game every action-game developing company carefully needs study order their games success . shortly after release once gasp world ended , two game developers joined together create game not gasped world again , but made it scream . game pits terrorists counter-terrorists fast-paced sort " s.w.a.t. " type tactical firefighting gameplay . matches consist one two types game types . first probably most popular type bomb defusal . both game types , you win either eliminating opposing team or following objective . bomb defusal random player team receive bomb each round . player plant bomb one two bomb spots or simply drop bomb teammate pick it up use it . once bomb planted counter-terrorists must defuse it regardless if terrorists eliminated . counter-terrorists usually thirty-five seconds defuse bomb win round . second type gameplay hostage rescue . terrorists must protect four hostages area map counter-terrorists rescuing them taking them their base . if hostages killed terrorists or counter-terrorists , nothing happen except now counter-terrorists must completely kill terrorists gain victory round . start each round all players few seconds quickly buy weapons money they achieved past rounds victories . both teams significant difference arsenal weapons you choose , but neither really focuses specific time gun style . all weapons game one-hundred percent realistic deadly reality . this element makes counter-strike such superior game . counter-strike without argument most popular online action game world . entire culture formed around it . so what makes it such extremely addictive popular game ? it purely because fantastically well-crafted gameplay not graphics , or game would not popular it . players around world give you many " deep " reasons why it such great game . but one without argument stands out . it simply fact versus other games , it " difficult " make kill game . what makes game so addicting pleasure killing someone after long thirty second gunfight or quick shot head , knowing dead player now experiencing some form anger he waits out rest round . element how realistic guns feel game . regardless if they fake shooting totally simulated , it superiorly well . definitely once new player game gained enough experience achieve kills least periodically , feeling " power " experienced when holding ak-47 or m4 . game quite punishing new players , total hapzard players who never played first-person shooters or video games all . but regardless stress you feel first , there absolutely no reason put down game because entry-difficulty , it almost guaranteed you get better game . there over ten maps game , each one masterpiece . all maps wildly differ each other feel action even environment . most popular all maps , de_dust2 created davej , still commonly referenced many gaming parodies , magazines , shows , etc . due its style simplicity , it godly-designed map arguably most popular map first-person shooter history . one thing helps fight player bored game simply maps . since each map superbly designed , player could easily switch one after bored continue play , different feel . game also many public map editors which 3rd parties use create custom maps . fy_iceworld awp_map some very popular maps created amateur designers . this makes counter-strike game almost " infinite " value sort feel . sound counter-strike absolutely insanely-realistic . first time player plays or even watches player play game , person definitely without doubt notice clear sounds ak-47 fire or pistol fire . not much known why guns sound so realistic , player best guess designers actually recorded live gunfire weapons . sound weapons combined look feel ; end up making player totally immersed into game feeling " power " . this sort thing extremely rare video game . time counter-strike simply jaw-dropping graphics . created all half-life engine , players amazed lighting effects how clear textures . present , game doesn't hold same , but it what past mattered . half-life one first games history some slightly complex dynamic physics . bouncing flashbang or player blown away also something time look . games before release half-life hardly any sort physics , if they , it would something very basic . counter-strike game without argument should any player hard drive . there still even thousands players since release game back 1998 , still actually play game without losing ounce boredom . counter-strike forever played , heart all action games past , present , future .	1

i'm 15 i star wars : battlefront 1 2 , star wars : knights old republic 1 2 , this game , i'm getting lego star wars mail any day now . i really like star wars : battlefront 2 star wars : knights old republic 1 , but this game hard place how much i like it . i got this game 2 days ago after work like 2 pm i played it until like 1 am then i woke up next day 9 am i beat it maybe 1 pm . so it took me half day beat . i really mad when i beat it because i fun it just suddenly ended . it really stupid ending too ! good : - you really good control over your squad variety different orders such telling squad mate set up sniping position one spot or telling your slicer slice open door you . this good so you dont everything yourself you dont rely your squad give you covering fire when it takes whole minute slice into computer data base . -the weapons pretty sweet they ones you never really seen before ( except maybe thermal detonators or wookie bowcaster . )-if you become incapacitated , you tell your squad come revive you , or if you don't feel like fighting , tell them just maintain their current orders revive you after fighting . -the way heal yourself bacta station , which i think better than running over health container . -the ai good so your squad actually knows how figh t.t he bad : -the game lot shorter than i expected only 3 different planets/ships-there only 5 different enemies : battle droids , super battle droids , trandoshans , geonosians , magna guards . -the enemies all act same every battle . -super battle droids really annoying fight because they really tough beat if you just blaster rife ( unless you're noob play it easy . )-telling your squad things gets repetative after while . -the ending sucks . -once you beat it , you only play game over harder setting , which not really fun , or play your friends multiplayers , which isn't fun either . so you just put it back shelf while until you're bored feel like playing it again . so , all-in-all , this really fun game until you beat it . so i suggest you " pace " yourself .	1
i haven't tried it light gun yet , but even 2 dual-shocks this unique accessible 2-player o-o game ( one drives , one shoots ) decent replay value . i don't think difficulty increased , but it fun go back beat your old scores play unlocked cars . i suppose it could finished rental , but personally i find it nice own some simple o-o games like this you pop play right away if friend shows up , esp . if friend not hardcore gamer . 1-player game it starts feel like gta-lite after awhile , although kids this one better because it lacks mature content	1
this game remains one my favorite games all time . i'm old school game , i've played computer games since i atari st cartridge . i played other gta games , i liked them very much , they all addictive . this one , this one trully jewel crown . there many things i could say , but i just don't want repeat same waffle . it great game , characters all superb , voiced great actors . ray liotta just fire tommy vercetti . i'm still suprised they got all this talent , there seems no stone un turned , even blondie get minor par t.t his many thumbs way up . indeed , it notorious , it not minors , though no doubt there more minors played this than adults . lot it subject matter just kicks , just teh kind amusement we seek because it kind thing we would never normally our wildest dreams ; other part , inmo , jsut sheer style . i can't recommend this title enough . only possible downside it , this just picky loading times various parts city . this eliminated san andreas , but this one one . " i run this town ! me !! " - tommy vercetti	1

... which ok . i think if they made this game fully controlled stylus touchpad it would make it bit wacky . sort like mario 64 ds . like mario kart , you 2nd screen your map . but you also use it use items whenever you like also jump area area whenever you wan t.t hat really jist this game when it comes new features . someone wrote " loosely based " off old 2d side scroller marios , but actually this very much based off them entirely . only difference environments characters full 3d yet still side scrolling view . which nice touch watching 3d models move around like . other then it nice update old classics . especially big mario which you never get much play thanks use giant mushroom . vice versa mini mushroom causes mario shrink ( only way access other levels defeating enemy bosses mini mario ) . there also new shell costume which mario dons , but quickly get out control if you run fast he spins all over . all all it very fun game , entertaining , but not very hard , which good young folks but those reminiscent old days know how hard it beat mario game back then , this surprisingly easy . luckily game packed mulitplayer features mini games add value they . not all entirely fun , but majority make use touchpad make up not using it much throughout game . playing 2 player always fun course , unfortunately it not wifi so you within range someone else game	1
i enjoyed playing this game , when it would let me ... amount bugs this game downright outrageous , crashes left right . it good story though . i suppose i could give you few tips ... stop dantooine framerate dropping , go folder where your game files ex . : /program files/lucasarts/swkotor2 , open swkotor2 . ini file ( my xp icon notepad cogwheel over it ) , under [ graphics options ] heading insert line type :d isable vertex buffer objects = 1that should get rid any bad framerate drops dantooine least make it playable . also , i glitch near end game where i went back dantooine , but when i tried get off my ship , planet wouldn't load , i tried restarting all jazz , nothing worked , finnaly i found online cheatcode warp straight dantooine so use it , open swkotor2 . ini file i said above under [ game options ] header insert line type : enablecheats = 1then start starwars : kotor2 load your game , press this button : ` one ~ sign right above it , just above tab key . then type : warp 605dan-then press enter-don't worry fact you can't see your typing , cheat console invisible . tada ! your dantooine finish your game ! only other advice i you ! save often ! ! don't overwrite your saved games ! i found saving your games 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc ., quick way this . may force you	1
if you switch xbox 360 , buy this game first your last xbox game , you won't disappointed . this game best graphics i ever seen console . although it great graphics , physics real selling point . you pick up virtually anything world throw it around or stack it gravity gun ( zero-point energy manipulator ) . barrels float water like they should explosions suprisingly realistic . enemies challenging varied dead bodies flop around like they should ( especially when you shoot them shotgun ) . voice acting very well characters turn look you if you move around . only drawback choppy framerates times . highly recommended	1
i love playing this game . icewind dale ii 3rd edition rules graphics great	1
ignore anyone who talks this game " shortcomings . " it fun game , addictive game . period . although one reviewer suggests some levels too easy , i say this only goes keep game ( plot ) moving . fact , let face it , when you break tasks down , events typical episode 24 aren't complex . you run , you hide , you shoot things . you drive fast chase people . but you it all , looking , sounding , panting ( yes , video jack bauer even breathes like him ) almost if you show . kiss adage fabulously apt . keeping it simple how game-makers kept it fun . related this comment trying make actual game play last 24 hours . firstly , show itself little loosy-goosey real " hour " what commercial breaks its creative liberties . secondly , each " hour " broken up into smaller missions , learning what it takes well each section take little time . thirdly , those choose complete their missions finesse ( higher scores ) find they're not only coming closer " hour , " they're also more fun , because they're acting more like characters show . after all , i suppose someone who wants complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone , instead just run past enemies ! or better yet , if reviewer really wants take " 24 hour " thing seriously , i'm surprised he isn't complaining able save progress memory card . he really ought asking game that played straight out entire 24 hours , no saving , get it right first time , just like show .	1

this second elder scrolls game i've played , first oblivion . i really enjoyed oblivion decided give this one try , i must say i've really enjoyed it so far . still main quest , though right now i'm gonna join morag tong . now first off , if you're impatient type , or really easily confused , then this game not you . this game takes time patience really enjoy . one thing i when i first started playing ; i paid attention what people said went where i told go . i know it game really gives you freedom what you want , but someone just starting out series , just follow main quest line make sure pay attention what people say , just go where you need . then , once you've become more accustomed how things work , then i'd suggest exploring some . you'll often come across people roads quests they'll want give you that'll often deviate your current objective . i would actually suggest helping them out , journal often enough get you back track afterwards . just remember stay roads , look every sign you come across so you know which way go . closing , if you patience willing put some serious time into game , then i'd suggest getting this . it older game , graphics clearly outdated , but it quite enjoyable experience . fact , i'm liking it more than oblivion , which my attention few months . no telling when i'll this one	1
my kids really like memory cards because they keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	1
i heard how amazing final fantasy vi supposed . so , i thought , i get this game , even if just fill out my final fantasy collection . first off , i start . i heard many sources this game wasn't very good . i , fact , find it just good vi ! vi just good i expecting . it funny , very memorable characters dialog . my only problem two games there bit lag . lag not bad all , but pretty noticable vi . while , it minor inconvience me , most people may find it more irritating . don't get me wrong , i don't think lag enough actually mess you up , but it get little annoying . overall , i got two great games price one bargain game . i must say , i am completely satisfied	1
this isn't much like spiderman games i'm used , but it definitely lot fun . good storyline fighting game . single player challenging ( but beatable ) uses most if not all characters . there plenty characters , most different unique powers . there two versus modes : against computer or against friend . computer pretty easy beat . each character it own pros cons . thing i like character levels aren't same ( anybody remember super smash bros ? ) . most games there lot different people but they're mostly same your winning mostly just rides your experience their moves . this there some major strong characters unlocked end . i actually got bored little dissappointed after playing this couple days , but little while ago i started playing again it awesome . recommended comic book fans	1
i dont know what everyone else reviews said but beleieve me this game awesome ! graphics out this world , its very suspenseful . there murder or dead body around every corner , you get firgure out who it ! ending best , it took me my brother least 24 hours , ( not all once course ) , solve this mystery . it really great buy ! ~ andre	1
you've read lot reviews get this one , most likely , they've gone how great it looks ( it look tremendous ) , how fantastic gameplay ( it awe-inspiring ) , how just absolutely great gaming experience it . there few things i would like add . first off , there one slight problem game . personally , action games 3rd-person variety , i like able control camera . this game not . instead , you taken where gamemakers want you go only what they want you see . this very slight complaint , one i'm hoping improved god war ii . second thing i would like add mythological aspect this game great ! it really gives game very epic scale not found great many games . it thing drives this game farther than it usually would . it tremendously entertaining , t-t imes thought-provoking , game sense gravitas most action slice'em-dice'em games this type get . get it	1
great game , higly addictive , gets really tuff once you play veteran mode ! definately game your collection .	1
... me . let me explain , oh my friends ! little history . started playing shooters pc when i youngin ' . quake first . quake ii followed . iii . unreal . unreal tournament . few lesser titles . all multiplayer , mind you . since i kid , there always something so ( divinely ) mind boggling able link up different machines ( time computers ) not only participate , but kill your friends , ultra cool weapons like , -- literally -- universe outside our own . , truly -- there anything cooler ? it like psychically connecting your friends lucid dream , only peppered concrete universe filled its own physics laws . point divuldging into this intimate joy mine paper (?) ? ever since i've introduced this experience ' multiplayer ' , i pretty much neglected single player all games like deformed foster child epilepsy . so why ' call duty 2 ' xbox 360 revolutionary gamer such myself ? it converted me . what , you ask ? pc , console . i defiantly backed my beliefs -- console could not ( hadn't -- objective fact i'd say ! ) come close pc regards multiplayer gaming . first person shooters only solidified argument . one , you've got mouse , which undeniably offers more precise degree control . i played mario brothers controller , but after playing ' goldeneye ' nintendo 64 whenever i attended friends house way back when , i shuddered disgust . controller couldn't touch what i used , not mention fact you're playing full screen computer , very accomplished speed , opposed split screen console , which , one dared play four player , reached framerates dire levels , not unlike viewing screenshots ' net ( i exaggerate only slightly ) . so here comes ' call duty 2 ' xbox 360 . starters i only bought system because friend convinced me i actually impulsive it , which i'm usually not . ' project gotham racing ' while which actually pretty fun online , if bit hard , i never into racing games . few weeks later i bought duty , i impressed . let me just say off bat many know , first many months game existence online play would become unplayable when certain amount people clogged server . sometime back now , however , guys finally released patch game now works well it possibly could . now , this why game refuses let me abandon it : - graphics very good , perhaps more importantly , framerate excellent . reoccuring problem among past console shooters ( halo halo 2 prayed it could touch 60 frames per second like cod2 ) yet overcome , we now finally game runs silky smooth 95% time , practically unaffected number players screen or viewing distance larger levels . it gloriously smooth , i am completely obsessive this sort thing . add this graphical prowess ( which too stunning despite overall -- but my opinion inconsequential -- semi-lack detail textures ) , you've got gaming universe good go even most demanding lowlife . - control -- great help consistent framerate -- good . once you've gotten used it , it radiates . best i've used console , beating out even halo ( which i dabbed bit via friends ) due again huge improvement rendering speed graphics . it becomes intuitive but constant ability probe deeper into skill level . i personally play ' high ' sensitivity setting while i'm still not good i would mouse ( theorhetically ) , i am good -- far better than i could ever imagined controller . - net code delicious . even pings up 2-300 ( kind stretching it ) , you -- very -- little disadvantage over even host . because way it works , you aren't shooting it shoot . 2 seconds later . however it it , it , but it compensates latency there practically no unfair play result . this whole point immense value because awesome graphics speed netcode offers essentially no determent any kind . overall , this all adds up near-perfect online gaming experience good any i've played pc ... just stunning . oh yeah , xbox live interface whole friend dealie ? brilliant . get friends seconds any point time . microphone course adds greatness already great experience . - game . it fun anything . weapons awesome . sound effects blast make totally satisfying kills . everything well balanced , despite fact lesser skilled players say snipers outweigh all other weapons . maps overall wonderfully designed dynamic . personally i'm still into standard modes play ( there five ) -- deathmatch team deathmatch -- they riot . it all works , beautifully . it fun , so fun , consequently become like powerful drug . hmmm . so yeah , five stars without any hesitation whatsoever , based simply multiplayer . it one game never , second , made me regret purchase 360	1

graphics leave something desired but story game play make this game must play any rpg fan .	1
this game pretty much like gta , same sort graphics , same way driving , same way shooting ... but better part fighting how u threaten people streets scare them instead just killing them . this pretty much follows " godfather " movie story line . example luca brossi dies micheal leaves sicily . one create there mob face game which really cool . then you get accepted corleone family , even get talk don himself . unlike other games if your doing mission some character help you , character doesn't die kills people instead just standing there . my favorite mission when your sonny taking over one enemy families warehouse . game just great amazing ... go buy it	1

people no doubt find nintendo ds lite way nintendo sucker people out their money . it way , if you think yourself sucker , but me ds lite little better . simply put , if you're content your original ds , then don't even waste time buy this one . if you don't ds period , ds lite much better investment than original bulky one . ds lite , gameplay made little simplar . button placement brighter screen make gameplay little better . one , start select buttons moved resemble where they original gameboy advance . this makes handling some functions ( especially gba games ) lot easier . buttons , sadly , still little small guys big hands like myself . ds lite also comes phony gba cartridge ( called " cap " ) . if you don't gba game plugged into system , you put phony cartridge keep it collecting dust there . however , when you stick gba game , it sticks out centimeter . it just looks weird . cap , least , keep system looking good . perhaps most welcome change ds lite screen . original ds screen not exactly bright . fact , it , comparison ds lite , rather dark . games like metroid prime hunters darker than they . this new screen , difference how bright games appear really shows . not only but , you adjust brightness if need . it doesn't really affect battery life , either . you play ds lite long you played original . also like original , it charges while you play . welcome difference touch screen itself . these screens last lot longer than original ds . those who original ds no doubt experienced lot scratches their screen their stylus . point where it noticeable . you could still see screen , but it apparent stylus doing number it . screen more protected here . stylus doesn't scratch screen quite easily . other words , touch screen lasts lot longer . ds lite also looks better , fits your pocket better . it also performs all tasks regular ds . example , if you're playing game you suddenly go , just flip it closed it sleeps . there also place store stylus , stylus better too . it little bigger thicker , so it not quite easy lose . some problems original ds still plague ds lite however . you still can't play gameboy color or regular gameboy games ds lite . also , you still can't configure controls play gba game much easier . other words you can't configure " " " " when you play gba game . this probably won't bother you long run , however . also , touch screen still its sensitivity . touching touch screen your bare hands more dangerous than stylus scratching screen . oils your fingers might damage screen therefore , it won't respond touch even your stylus . when original ds launched , owners note there not very many good games availible . only good game during its launch 2004 super mario 64 ds . now there plenty games out there ( not all them ports ) , so if you want ds , this great time get one , ds lite better investment than original one far . ds may not play movies , or mp3 players , but honest , almost defeats purpose gaming system . am i looking buy portable entertainment center ? course not , i'm looking find system play some my games , nintendo ds delivers . real gamers know it games , not bells whistles system . casual gamer , nintendo ds delivers , ds lite fine improvemen t.t he good+vastly superior original ds+it fits your pocket easier+the screen much brighter+touch screen more durable+the placement start select buttons easier+a better stylus+the battery life unchangedthe bad-those original ds , who want ds lite spend more money yet ds-some cons original ds still her	1

while i only own one game ds , what makes it so great wifi ability play friends . i spent couple afternoons friend house several other people , all playing mario kart against each other , it fun time full excitement people yelling , either knocked back 1st dead last , or managing squeeze out win last second . touch screen also great addition ds . some games allow either touch screen or standard controls used , depending preference . others , like mario kart , stick standard controls , others require use just touch screen , creating very unique kind game . lite also improvement first ds . while it may not worth it upgrade if you already first ds , it worth it if it your only ds . lite better shaped , better battery life , better , brighter screens . ds lite certainly great handheld console	1
i bought it coz i always wanted something like this , after i got it i just went bought game , i made little mistake ask who i am living said " i dont like games " which one should i buy , well we picked animal crossing machine games so good i havent able play it too often it taken away me hehehehehso my review his he sais it deserves five star	1
this collection isn't bonus feature happy anthology . this version ff4 ( 2 usa time snes/genesis era ) hasn't changed much . random battle loading screen like snes version , switch field/world map character menu while loading fast hell ( while sadly chrono trigger slower than 2 ff games anthology collection even slower than other final fantasy games psone era ( 7 , 8 , 9 )) chrono trigger lot bonus features this version . squaresoft ( time ) put *** load cinemas ( mainly ending cinemas ) , list music game , other stuff . gameplay still same , exception what i said earlier , which good otherwise . unlike anthology , this collection no bonus music cd ( those who care anyway ) . this still worth owning anyway	1
this disc set contains two spectacular games , final fantasy iv chrono trigger . both games wonderful . i played every version final fantasy iv , japanese version fan translated , english version snes remade version psx . i loved all three versions . final fantasy iv storyline great . plot starts right away . storylien gripping it makes you feel lot symphathy characters . all characters well developed personalities this game quest redemotion it shows people change . when cecil situation where he must choose honor dignity versus life he knew- he makes decision change his life forever . he goes against everything he learned right thing , what his conscience tells him embarks quest redemption . when he becomes new person , other characters developed , his relationship his lover his companions delved into . storyline great- wonderful love story great tale	1
there aren't many games now-a-days get me interested enough play regularly , but dominions 2 one definitely . it multiplayer , multi-platform ( mac , windows , linux ) , turn-based strategy game . there tun different strategies go , many nations , magic items , spells , different units . excellent game hardcore strategy person . only drawback interface . it certainly not perfect takes bit get used . but there lots documentation online help kind stuff . i'd highly recommend this game anyone who likes good multiplayer turn-based strategy . it best i've ever played ( i've played quite few	1
my friend told me it unbelivably fun said if u like good laugh it`s must !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
this great even if you nes games . one you bring it anywhere it doesn't 2 player mode . it compatible gba sp because it not require game link port sp . only flaw you need scan 10 cards play one nes game you only save one time . still , won't stop you cuz when you get proficient swiping them , its nothing . but e-reader more than nes games ; you may play e-readers nintendo magazines , you play game watch games , look pokemon ( who cares feature ??? ) , connect games like super mario bros . 3 get power-ups well new levels , hook up gamecube double experience . only problem connect games you need 2 game boys link cable but it isn't too much problem . also , e-reader packs fairly cheap even new york city . gameplay graphics faithful originals , too	1
so , if it such excellent game , why 4 stars " fun " rating ? well , it very very fun game , but some parts get annoying aggravating . it seems if different levels difficulty achieved handing you less less health upgrades , which kinda cheap , if you ask me . they physically limit you , instead strategicly doing so . but everything else great it . graphics great , not excellent , but great . sound great too . gameplay excellent story very well developed . kinda easy side normal level , though . but , i guess nothing perfect . go ahead get this one . it worth what it costs	1
those played similar games like sim city before , this one great ! i played sim city 2000 , but years ago . i found game addicting . now , years later , when i ordered sim city 4 : deluxe edition , i blown away ! this game much better than 2000 could hope . they resolved many issues i older game then some . i found this game addicting , started different cities same time . i am working getting " perfect city " me happy . i highly recommend this game anyone who fan any sim games . i could even say times it funny even read tongue-in-cheek sayings come up just you starting up game day like " bureaucratizing bureaucracies " . it not so much hilarious but , it help you get " fun mode " play game . advisors get slightly annoying after awhile , especially when you different idea what you want see your city than they , but it still overall very entertaining game . my next purchase most likely sims 2 , more sims experience	1
tekken 5 , folks namco crafted best edition yet long running fighting franchise . featuring horde fighters , undoubtadly best lineup yet , tekken 5 features same deep gameplay combo mechanics keep you playing quite some time . because it tekken , there bevy hidden characters features unlock well . there no tekken force mode this time around , instead there devil within , segment similar tekken force where you play jin kazama he battles his way learn devil gene within him . it not much write home itself , but there more features behold here well , including addition playing arcade versions tekken 1 , 2 , 3 well namco shooter starblade . graphics improved backgrounds revamped well , all helping make tekken 5 best fighter not just ps2 , but home consoles general . veterans series newcomers alike , tekken 5 masterpiece , essential every ps2 owner library	1
i similar difficulties this hi-def adapter . one thing , plugs nearly impossible get into sockets . once i get them , all i got black screen . but thanks friend , i figured out what problem : if you're trouble getting those monster cables attached ( who hasn't ? ) , you should get deoxit progold kit caig . it just two very small cans stuff help clean off your connectors , more importantly , act temporary lubricant . i got my kit radio shack . i think it twelve bucks . not getting any picture all , my fault . i didn't realize two sets inputs my tv 1080i only . once i moved plugs proper jacks , turned off signals not apply my xbox dashboard , picture sharp brigh t.t he cables good quality . my only problem them proprietary digital audio connector . it kind lame monster require you buy their special optical cable comes right adapter . other than , if you've got cash , get these cables , caig kit	1
it pretty fun game . it doesn't whole lot songs , maybe around 30-40 , but ones it fun sing songs generally lot people know , or would willing learn . there also several different modes play , so you play game over over never get tired it . perhaps one best features up 8 people play without any extra expansion packs or controllers ; all you need one controller usb headset you just pass it around everyone play . i agree everyone else , though , when they say headset very flimsy . i originally going get separate headset but bought package deal . bad idea . you practically eat thing sing , it small get caught long hair . plus , you don't get fun karaoke experience . my advice : buy game separately , then get handheld mic . soon i get some more money i'm gonna get handheld mic myself , it picks your voice up better . overall , good buy ! lots fun , especially if you lot outgoing , un-self-conscious people	1
i would recommend this those who just wants more than just shooting fat ass people or aliens just slobbering cra	1
note : this review spoiler free regards game storyall good things must eventually come end , such star wars series , lord rings trilogy , jak daxter trilogy ( not including racing game daxter own psp game ) . after two excellent games , our favorite elfin friend his furry sidekick come last entry jak trilogy . big question : it good ending ? i'm pleased say overall , yes . jak 3 takes place undetermined time after conclusion jak 2 . haven city become divided after relentless attacks robots , metal heads other nasties . population blames jak these problems he finds himself flown out wasteland , harsh unforgiving desert where nobody survive without help . abandoned those he saved , jak his buddy daxter set out thier final adventure . like it two predecessors , jak 3 platforming game combined gun shooter . you get various jumps , kicks , punches leaps , you also get wide array firearms take out your foes when your fancy kung-fu karate aren't enough . jak moves remain largely unchanged jak 2 ( which now called j2 ) . he still punch like man , jump like kangaroo , leap like bullfrog . gunplay remains pretty much same well . you get four guns ( blaster , rifle , machine gun peacemaker ) , but nice twist , each weapon gets various upgrades game goes . rifle example , starts out it default setting . hower , next upgrade allows it shoot richochet bullets while third upgrade gives it flying platform shoots bullets all directions . each gun three upgrades playing them blast . peace maker example , fire shot paralyzes all enemies makes them float around ( whee ! ) while it final upgrade ... well , let just say you'll shooting mini-nukes lo t.t he biggest change jak game play comes form vehicles . while j2 flying vehicles zoomers , jak 3 cars ( not nice , talking pixar kind ) . because half game set desert , jak daxter get around dune buggies . there eight them each various unique traits . some really , really fast , one jump riddiculously high ( wheee ! ) some them spin out control slightest twitch control stick ( boo ! ) . you'll spending lot time driving buggies most part , it enjoyable fun , though some them ( such sand shark ) bit difficult handle . new feature jak 3 sheer size it . j1 j2 two enormous areas run around . here , you not one , not two , but three , yes , three ! gigantic areas run around . like previous games , there no loading times , astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds ( spargus city , wasteland haven city ) . you'll definatly see lot amazing sights during your trips throughout jak 3 world ( such how haven city ... ahem ... changed since last game ) . dark jak powers return well , but now balanced new side our hero ... light jak . if dark jak attacking force , light jak defensive force . dark allows you kill things really quickly , while light allows you heal , fly ( this so awesome ! ) , surround yourself inpenetrable shield , even slow down time crawl . both powers activated any time long you light dark eco your meters . very nice touch , you stop light or dark touch button save your energy when you really need it . while both light dark come into play vital moments during gameplay , both really just little added bonus spice up gameplay when you want , you play throughout game without needing use either force ( except scripted moments where you need ) . but then again , able heal yourself whenever you want very handy thing ! * smile*like j2 , jak 3 you going place place , talking people doing what they tell you . when you finish , you head over next person what they want , etc . it linear system makes it easy tell where go what next it sounds fairly restrictive , but it one big strength : you don't start next mission until you want . if you want , you wander around wasteland blowing up wanderers twenty hours , go hunt down twelve precurser orbs watch sun go up down three times , then tackle mission . this free roaming system allows you what you'd like if you don't feel like doing missions while . one thing i'd like address before we go any further difficulty level . if one takes look my review j2 , one find lot anger hatred directed towards naughty dog making j2 most unnecessarily hardest game i've ever played ( it still way , tied only spider man ps2 ) . i am very pleased naughty dog towned down difficulty lot jak 3 . no longer each every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it , no longer you throwing controller into tv while screaming obscenities becuase a**hole errol won fricken race again . here , difficulty seems just right . not too hard , not too easy . most missions require few attempts before they completed , few finished one try . there still few quite difficult , one or two grit-your-teeth inducing , but overall , nothing infuriating many moments previous entry series . oh , there only few " go through ring " missions this time around . thank goodness . addition free-roaming gameplay , there also plenty secrets unlock this quest . there over 600 precurser orbs find collect jak 3 , doing so you get unlock various features such unlimited dark light jak power , invincibility , extra vehicles , various weapon upgrades , etc . while some hidden behind corners , many these orbs collected doing various challenges people throw your way , such searching around paticular area , going through rings ( grumbles ) , following little blue light even stopping time . there plenty things get those little shiny orbs , but results well worth it . addition , jak 3 arguably best moments series terms " wow " factor . fighting gigantic sixty story tall monster only dune buggy moment sends shivers down your spine . even all these fine points , jak 3 stutter little bit what arguably most important part game ... story . j2 most memorable me it story . it many twists turns you never really knew what expect next . story jak 3 good one it keep your interest what going happen next ... but ultimitly , it left me unsatisfied . how so ? three biggest ones charachters , precursers ending . those you worrying i'm going tell you who precursers ( which i won't ) i'm going keep this spoiler free i . first off , charachters . we jak daxter course , those two always fun watch care . we many returning charachters such torn , sig , samos , we some new residents spargus city . problem ? almost all returning charachters zilch charachter development . it assumed you know them last game because , jak 3 takes no time explain who they or what they . may okay , but pretty much none charachters expanded all . torn still gruff tough ( but not much last time ) , ashelin firm leader , samos gives warnings what may happen planet if things go badly . keira , who such vital charachter j1 j2 , absoloutly nothing story aside look pretty important . sig ... well , he just there because he cool . only returning charachter who kept me interested tess , who fufills " dumb blonde " role . her relationship daxter sweet lighthearted kept my interest easily . errol returns well ( though i won't say how ) , but he gone " insanely irritating " " average irritating " , sad departure his compellingly egotistic nature j2 . new charachters , only one , damos , kept my interest due his charachter . tough , yet gentle caring same time , he easily most compelling jak new companions . new villian , count veger , isn't compelling , though he some very powerful scenes ( especially one near ending ) . one claims back game box we'll discover shocking secret who precursers really . i said earlier , i won't reveal who precursers ( someone ruined suprise me ) , except my personal opinion , we should never find out who precursers leave them mystery . i personally felt seeing who they really sucked out all suspense mystery , esepcially since they talked length two games now . it like revealing face doctor claw . when you go back experience your old memories , there no more mystery or wonder anymore . my personal opinion , these beings should remained hidden forever . however , saddest part game me ending . again , i won't ruin it you , but it always sad when game developers wrap entire trilogy up three minutes . some people criticise ending film , return king , saying it goes too long . however , ending lord rings film trilogy took it time wrapping up threads three movies bringing closure story leaving one satisfied . however , jak 3 doesn't . game goes gets closer end , feeling dread idea everything destroyed just vanishes pretty much gone time final boss battle comes ( sadly , battle itself isn't exciting or memorable ) . ending end trilogy , but leaves door wide open more games ( which two already happened ) . i've invested lot time these three games , i've grown attatched it charachters i would like closure all thier stories . saldy , doesn't happen . everything left wide open when , my opinion , it should closed . there no real ending here , least , one ties everything up nicely . but despite my points story , i want stress jak 3 very good game . it satisfying blend storytelling , platforming , shooting , driving , action . it one those games where you keep saying " just five more minutes , just five more minutes " , only discover time flown it two morning . it addictive , fun , , me , blast play . i definitly recommend it , especially if you find it under twenty dollars	1

i say this game worth every dollar spent ! it game i keep life probably play again someday ! i don't know what previous final fantasy games like so me there no comparison . i think i'm totally biased toward final fantasy . two coolest aspects this game , me , aeons blitzball . other thing i like this game storyline , characters beautiful scenary . i forgot mention how great music also . i've reading reviews current previous final fantasy games thing still missing me , aeons blitzball . i'm also attached characters final fantasy . even sequel doesn't cut it me right now . me , it final fantasy all way	1
if i pick one system play exclusively , based several factors , i'd choose ds . now , i'm glad i option ( i.e. money ) keep purchasing home consoles , but if some bizarro world where i could only take one system ... well , you get idea . way , ds reminds me ps2 . it bargain . it backwards compatible so it plays gba game . games abundandt perhaps more importantly they varied around $30 . you can't go wrong	1
best set wireless controllers i purchased my xbox system . controllers nicely fitted comfortable use not cramp up your hands after hours play . connects great no interruptions while game playing , i highly recommend these anyone looking buy controllers out there . they awesome looking . great playing halo 2 , i use it alot this game it bomb , plus my ranking gone up since using it while playing xbox live	1
memory card 1019 nintendo excellent saving gamecube saves . i used delete old save files favor ones newer games . some games required so much space it impossible save anything them . i tried some 3rd party brands before , but gamesaves often became corrupted . i this memory card nearly year now nothing i saved become corrupted . even nearly 60 different gamesaves it , some some rather large games like sims 2 , i still more than enough space left . price bit more expensive , but its quality more than made up it already	1
this good game keeps you thinking . story line something terrible happened you end up able go back time change events therefore change outcome . you get go back different era such horse buggy era back modern day . there several endings well depending what you've . you end up playing it through several times experience different endings . plot story good game good pace because time issue . so you feel like you got stay your toes	1
i recently picked this game up because laptop i purchased college finally computer powerful enough run it . it easily one best computer games i've ever played . playing world massive ( you literally walk any mountain or monument you see distance ) there multiple ways accomplish goal and/or solve mission . basic plot this : you jack carver , who accompanied woman part micronesia undisclosed reasons ( she turns out cia agent ) , before long she kidnapped , you fighting your life against army well-trained mercenaries . it fairly generic shooter plot , but it gets point across ties everything together well . enemy ai unbelievably good . soldiers work together take you down ( all while dropping hilariously bad one-liners like " how you like those apples ?? " , " right eyes , mofo ! " , " i'm gonna tear you new one !! " ) . shootouts result this game blast : you really get good cover strategize your fight . it first shooter i've played makes me feel like i'm actually action movie . vehicles one game biggest highlights . if you want move quicker downstream , you snipe occupants frequent patrol boats water steal their ride . you often obtain rvs atvs ( one point game , forklift reasons unknown ) . these blast you drive right through enemies firing you . one thing i enjoy doing driving full speed enemy bailing out last second . always good fun . game also great challenge . i just completed game medium setting it still almost impossible places . fighting trigens ( small monkey-like creatures claws ) nightmare any diffculty , they outrun outjump you kill you , often , single hit ( i strongly suggest using sniper rifle or powerful machine gun other than m4 them long distance before they really mess you up ! )in short , this best fps i ever played , probably one best computer games ever made overall . highly recommended . ( side note : not it matters me , but i'm personally surprised this game got mature rating ... there barely any blood all , none it sticks floor . when shot rocket launcher , people don't explode like normally mature-rated shooters . this game should rated teen )	1
it used ( it couple years since i bought computer game new ) long your pc not too old , you could run any game it . no so oblivion ( some other new games i believe ) . run oblivion ( ) you need machine high end graphics card . so unless you bought pc specifically gaming , or specifically updated graphics card , oblivion just quit after intro screen , without telling you why ! while i readily accept not high end graphics card mean games not look good , it frustrating this game not even run my pc ( dual core , 1g ram ) . no , it still not run if you install manufacturer patch . however all not completely lost . i able install " oldblivion " ( just google it find site ) patch oldblivion site now it runs acceptably . oldblivion other patch graphics still pretty good ( better than morrowind though understandably not nearly good screenshots online ) , however it tends crash every so often ( its unclear whether or not this due graphics incompatibilities or just other bugs game ) . nonetheless , if high end graphics card , or patience apply all unofficial online patches , game pretty cool . i not big fan morrowind , but oblivion number improvements over morrowind ( my opinion ): 1 ) you fast travel ( just open up map click ) all cities any sites you before . even when you cannot fast travel new place , you usually walk nearly straight line there ( morrowind it maddening go someplace since i often would end up running into mountains i could not climb)2 ) oblivion not so dark gloomy , like morrowind ! 3 ) npc speak ( this me huge benefit , morrowind they might utter some cryptic phrase when they saw you but then you would through pages text dialouge -- if i wanted read i would pick up book , not play computer game ! )4 ) there quest arrow points towards person you need see . morrowind it incredibly tedious track people down ! 5 ) finally minor point , names people not look like programmers mashed hand keyboard ( morrowind there quests like " go see erajgukadfhs ask sakdfhslkdjf " . i just don't need when i am playing computer game ! one thing i not care oblivion way monsters level you . first character i , i got up level 15 found myself beaten up goblins ! unless you powergame ( stragically plan your leveling maximize stats combat skills ) or turn difficulty way down , leveling monsters makes game real pain -- combat related quests ( such painted trolls ) should not get harder more you level . all all it pretty fun game , but before you buy , make sure you high end graphics card ( or lot patience) !	1
if you rpg bone your body , back days paper rpg who didnt dream game where you could roam creepy tombs fighting undead , finding magic loot , avoiding traps , all near cartoon quality graphics .. thats game we all wanted . now finally i believe this first game fufills all aspects what all rpg'ers envisioned game . world free-form , enemy creatures well animated pose challenge combat , all characters dialogue real speech . theres strong challenging main quest complete . well you take your character many twists turns . want professional thief , you it . want murderer hits , you . ( shame you ) . want good guy help out people you . gameworld itself massive , you trapse across gorgeous(and sometimes dangerous ) countryside , crossing rivers , mountains , grassy plains . seasons change stars light up night , it really graphically amazing . thats where it pays top line pc , graphics amazing so you better current system . you get say athlon 3000xp 9800pro but part prices so cheap why would you want ? not doom3 , not halflife 2 , not prey , this game thats pressing people upgrade their machine . athlon 64 16 pipe 256mb graphics cards fairly cheap i'd say its worth upgrading just play this game . i athlon 64 4000 256mb x800xl i run game 1024x768 high detail . game ran well but some outdoor locations combat when things got busy it would slow down bit , so i dialed back draw distance bit plant draw distance now everything almost always very smooth . ( i think plant draw distance one easiest things dial back get more fps without sacrificing visual quality ) . i really cant this game justice review , i am loss words fully convey this games greatness . however i say if you even tiny love paper or computer rpgs this game you . if you enjoy final fantasy type games freedom this game bowl you over . if you like idea free form fantasy world you want get this . fact i hard time imagining anyone proper computer run this game not liking it . though if i imagine someone who wouldnt its someone who hates stories , cant bothered dialogue simply wants blast things hours . but they doom 3 so they're happy too .	1
this works great charging both my ds lite classic ds usb . i also like included keychain flashlight- it kind random thing include no way related charger , but it quite bright handy anyways . i'm not sure why previous reviewer says it doesn't fit ds lite- it , perfectly . perhaps she trying use gba micro adapter included ? you don't need to- adapter only charge classic ds/gba or gba micro- cable itself all you need charge ds lite	1
i just bought xbox 360 pro system couple weeks ago my local gamespot store call duty 3 . i later got gears war circuit city . xbox 360 pro system far best console system out there no matter what anybody says money . yes sony playstation 3 blu-ray disc media format nintendo wii system new remote controller 3-d movement . but both playstation 3 nintendo wii console systems just came out both systems already major bugs them . there already alot people out there who regret buying one those systems . if your smart , you'll wait year until all bugs fix both those console systems then think purchasing one those systems . what i xbox 360 . yes there major problems xbox 360 when it first came out just like there major problems now playstation 3 nintendo wii console systems . i waited year until microsoft fixed all bugs xbox 360 then i went out purchased it . right now xbox 360 best selection games out there . xbox live marketplace best online service out there . go read reviews few games out playstation 3 you see what i mean which system better games play . there already huge selection games play xbox 360 whole bunch new games xbox 360 coming out next year . unfortunately , there not too many new games coming out playstation 3 or nintendo wii next year . also , nintendo wii very poor graphics you can't play dvd movies it playstation 3 very few games choose play it also poor online service . xbox 360 already one year ahead other two systems out retail market , my friend , make huge difference which system choose go out buy play .	1

when i went online looking reviews i started get rather edgy buying this game , but omg ! this great game . sure it isn't best ff game out there , but it definately one better gun games out there . sometimes graphics get rather distorted , but i think a+ graphics middle game really make up it . i'm glad vincent finally gets his own game . short you people who hate this game wierd	1
r-type , legendary spaceship shooter , come blasting back her classic horizontally scrolling blueprint intact . through waves alien miscreants , you'll fight each gained inch space battlefield while collecting power-up items enhance your ship most primary weapon , mighty orb death . r-type trademarked invincible sphere docked front or rear ship , mood unleash deadly firestorms upon foes or hurled forward attack remotely smash through most anything it comes contact . though gameplay classic , graphics updated polygons ( thereby qualifying sony america license ) lots glowing lighting effects flowing gracefully over them . most enemies basic spaceships , but some levels well-animated living creatures , like badass water-worm things slither though level 2 . sadly , even crazy alien monsters , uber-weapons , 100+ ships giant bosses , r-type rather unexciting shooter . mood shield against nearly all projectiles ; so most levels spent calmly avoiding pinched narrow passages otherwise harmless enemy trains . not befitting task " humankind last hope .	1
hi , i am 11 yrs old , my next door neighboor little sister got pink nintendo lite . she 6 yrs old she recieved it her birthday . nintendo ds lite , she recieved cooking mama . i started play it , it really fun ! it fun get new recipies prepare food . my favorite making pizza , beef stew .	1

i've pretty much partial playstation controllers since i got my ps1 back 1997 . when i saw nintendo 64 controller , i nearly puked . joystick middle didn't make any sense me . i looked gamecube controller , wasn't exactly impressed . it looked kinda goofy-asymmetric , maybe . well , when i finally picked one up , i found it fit my hands much better than ps models . this would my favorite controller if nintendo changed few things . 1 . button too hard me reach . 2 . joystick pad awkward positions . fortunately most games don't really force you use these much , but if you're going put buttons controller , make them all easily accessible . due these flaws , i can't really say it better than playstation design . they're probalby tied	1
its simple , you use your controler most fuctions this remote but , it takes lot more time . same differance highspeed dialup . if you dont mind taking little longer get things then use controler . personally , i like my 360 remote	1
classic final fantasy games ( 1-3 [ not 6 ]) notorious their difficulty . this not hold true until you reach center moon . then , you find yourself guzzling elixirs , potions , ethers just kill one monster . example , behemoths ( found past b5 center moon , bahamuts cave ) counter every spell attack brutal 2300 hit one party member . most boss fights ( asura , bahamut ) tough monsters ( behemoths , wicked masks ) gimmick fights . bahamut actually one easiest fights game , just cast reflect all your party members . let me reinstate what previous reviewers said this game+ crisp graphics+ great music + sound+ fun+ more once you beat game- somewhat short ( beat eg zeromus 18hrs 42mins)- very difficult- prepare grind 10-15 levels once you reach center moon ! i enjoyed this , you bet i'm getting ff3 ds . great blast past , must-buy any final fantasy fan , rpg lover , or gba owner	1
ok look , although this old game , it one most popular fps(first person shooter ) games out there . ive played this atleast 5 years now , my friends i know still play cs today , like myself . planting bombs rescuing hostages , you'll find this game enjoyable . there lots custom made maps out there bring boardness official maps , playing this game 24/7 . screenshots trailers could even grab your attention , espicially clan trailers . if your looking great fps game , this it . =	1
this game great when you group friends come over . it really breaks ice you anybody you may not familiar it incredibly entertaining . i suggest this game everybody	1
i recieved this gift christmas day surprise . however , there mishap wal mart i guess mic they told my parents would work actually didn't so i hadn't able play until yesterday . however , now it all sorted out i finally able play using usb ps2 head set . game actually so much fun . first time i tried i went familiar songs , so i selected " pieces me " . i so bad first time it laughable , it failed me just i started second verse . but game gets so much better after your first few tries . after while i easily getting gold expert judging ( i immidiately like challenge myself ) . i breezing through songs i grew up loving such irene cara " fame " , wild cherry " play funky music " , vicki sue robinson " turn beat around " . then i going through songs dominating my cd player not too long ago such ashlee simpson " pieces me " , incubus ' " drive " , beyonce " crazy love " , hilary duff " fly " . it even better classics such madonna " material girl " , blondie " call me " , commodores " brick house " , whitney houston " i always love you " ( one many i haven't quite nailed yet ) . now order make platinum beyonce you actually sing like her ? no , which makes game very accessable . however , it doesn't hurt familiar your singing voice . over all this very fun game only one problem . while songs may fun , it very very diverse . sometimes too diverse it own good . take example when me my mom want play , songs we personally know two different erras . i'm wanting bust out " call me " , she wanting " i left my heart san francisco " . this creates only problem : unless your all around music-know-it-all ( which i'm not quite there yet ) you'll end up doing same songs over over again . but this really doesn't bring game down . if you've around listened wide variety songs then you should able cover good 30 songs . not mention , it would make great party game . i would suggest getting this game if you're into fun while not afraid make fool yourself	1
i played through fable lost chapters several times . all all , this very fun game . classic rpg elements leveling up , buying or finding new better weapons armor , choosing focus magic use or hack slash , choosing good or evil all included fable . graphics superb its time , voice acting top notch . addition , storyline quite good , more complex than average rpg ' save world ' tale . i heard some complaints fable too short , but if you take all quests max out all levels , game length should just fine ( unless you expecting 50+ hours morrowind experience ) . where fable loses some points controller setup . button configuration overwhelmingly complex , so much so finding yourself using item you not mean use frequent occurance . addition , you may find yourself using magic inopportune time , simply because you pressed trigger mistake . bow aiming feature might pop bad time ( like when you attacked 4 creatures ) , while rotating camera view , map pop-up might fill your screen you midst battle ( thus obscuring your view ) . also , fable tend some save problems . you may complete some quests save , upon reloading , quests may recompleted , or worse , may not saved not offered again ! still , these rather minor complaints . while fable really doesn't live up its advertising all-immersive rpg , it quite good , blast play if you like dd styled rpg . if you like zelda games but wish they more adult , definitely check out fable	1
we near end life span last generation consoles , key franchises appeared year after year begin wrap up their yearly development cycle . crazy it may sound , madden nfl 07 could one last times we see madden xbox , playstation 2 , or gamecube . mind , it not altogether surprising madden 07 doesn't really push envelope terribly far . game includes few new control features some mode tweaks ( nearly all which also available xbox 360 version this year game ) , but most part , it feels like result series pushed far it possibly go given platform , you definitely get sense madden current-generation consoles beginning wind down . however , least this last year , veteran player outraces up-and-comer xbox 360 version , there certainly enough compelling reasons check this year game out older consoles . madden nfl 07 brings back practically every feature madden 06 . top , number new gameplay upgrades brought table , majority which available all versions game . themselves , none these individual changes or upgrades particularly game changing , but taken whole , they add nice dimension depth . these features include highlight stick , new kick meter , lead blocking controls . highlight stick new version truck stick used runners offense . here , you use right control stick pull off sorts crazy jukes steps star running backs so well known , top , depending type back you're playing , you opt use more-powerful moves , or more finesse-based maneuvers . this feels like natural evolution last year truck stick , though most experienced madden players able get just easily using button-based moves rather than making liberal use stick . but if you take time learn stick figure out how use it button controls together , you very hard runner stop . new lead blocking controls likely inspire some new tactics all types players . here , while offense , you opt switch your controlled player any available blockers during running play . this includes offensive linemen , tight ends , fullbacks , or whoever else might blocking play . when blocking , you just standard blocks , or you even get dirty some mean-spirited cut blocks . this interesting mechanic , because it stops you rely cpu blockers , which any experienced player tell you , not always most reliable players field . you also quickly switch back control running back once you've laid down your block , which good , because cpu running back doesn't always manage find holes you're creating . first , you may find yourself unable effectively use this feature , setting up right blocks isn't always most intuitive thing world . but after some time , this control method gives running game really interesting new perspective , those who love finding new strategies bound eat this up . new kick meter probably most accurate representation kicking available game thus far . this meter , you use typical arrow line up your angle then press down right analog stick set up your power . meter quickly fills up , then you press forward right stick set power well your accuracy . accuracy based angle which you press up . if you press too far right or left , kick get away you . if you land it within set space , it go pretty much right where you want it . beyond , changes 06 07 mostly ancillary , fundamentally , game plays very much its predecessor . defense , there few more available options terms positioning your defensive players , you commit your defense certain direction moment ball snapped . offense , quarterback vision cone , which made its debut last year , still available , though it not required feature . you just tap right analog stick after snapping ball , it pop , letting you use it little accuracy boost . no , it not any more fun use than it last year , but that not altogether surprising . otherwise , pretty much every control feature you've come expect madden front center once again . potentially , some people could play through madden 07 never really partake new running control features , but there definitely enough all available upgrades add significant layer depth experience . even though madden nfl 07 doesn't any big , game-changing features make it especially memorable iteration series , its roster small , but useful changes ultimately more compelling than anything madden 06 offer last year . while some people undoubtedly over notion playing new games old consoles , madden 07 shows it still deliver some enjoyable football , regardless what platform it . it not big step forward , similarities this year last year might tough sell some . but it those similar aspects madden 07 ultimately improves upon over its predecessor , if you skipped out 06 , then there no good reason ignore 07 .	1
when i heard this game first , i stunned . ddr guitar hero both games focus " dance-like " " guitar-like " motions , but they not rely actual ability dance or actual ability play guitar , merely combinations responses through specialized controllers . karaoke revolution , however , actually guages accuracy your singing . your performance based how closely original song you sing your version , measured pitch voice . i would expected , tradition ddr guitar hero , karaoke revolution would " simplified singing " , hitting certain buttons controller produce certain singing notes screen . but no , this game uses real microphone your real voice . game also uses popular karaoke songs universally singable . it may not entirely my genre music i would sing karaoke bar , but almost all songs , i heard make passable attempt singing , there wide spread across genres across eras so most genres represented , there both older very modern music . i only used this game myself sing practice songs actual karaoke , but i imagine this game incredibly fun party well . it uses actual versions songs essentially like competitive karaoke ! , beyond , it also straightforward karaoke feature plays karaoke versions songs , complete words , straight-up karaoke parties such . this game one several this genre , i am personally looking forward playing all them . my only critique there limited numbers songs , thus , me least , limited playing time . if there on-line version this game could access much larger database songs play ( much like karaoke bar ) , i would gladly pay monthly fee play such game . let hope such thing works	1

i now played " vp2 " few days now , i say i like it . it its problems , but overall , it very fun game . " vp2 " takes place 100 or so years before original " vp " . i won't spoil any plot , except say many ruins visited original game appear beautiful cities " vp2 " , one gets sense we see why these cities became ruins course game . graphically , game beautiful . movies nice , if stiff times , sound great . mechanically , however , there some issues . " vp2 " attempts keep essence battle system original intact , while adding 3-d wrinkle . unfortunately , controls so gummy times you frustrated often you pleased results new system . all all , though , game excellent . i drop it star because control issues ..	1

we love katamari not wonderful music first game , but levels improved astronomically ! this game plays just like first , but there even more things find more creativity gameplay . every level one present find one four cousins capture each . we love katamari definitely makes katamari damacy seem repetitious . how this so ? well , mindless rolling no longer get you best score . example , one level you make katamari big you only 50 objects ( which quite difficult task such large area ) . level requires some serious searching money level . this level , you pick up things make more money , not increase size katamari meters . finding expensive jewelry early other pricy objects key making ton cash . there many other interesting levels this game , but i think it'd best leave them surprise . regarding complaints short length game , this far truth . game easier beat than first , but it still just hard make gigantic planets . i've spent hours trying my very best each level . i never got bored since most levels very unique . i highly recommend this game anyone any age . my five-year-old nieces nephews could not stop playing this game when they came over	1
this headset probably best xbox live recommended headset date . everything earpiece adjustable fit every size ear . big xbox live headsets uncomfortable begin hurt after half hours use . wearing halo 2 headset i actually forgot i even wearing it because it so light . they just released new version this headset also comes communicator no difference price . i greatly recommend this headset anyone plays xbox live regular basis	1

i ordered this set primarily lotr : return king , but after i got it , it turns out my graphics chip not powerful enough play it . but i able play other three games i really enjoyed freedom fighters medal honor . black white okay but i wasn't able get into it . but it should noted black white you get both original game expansion pack creature isle . so you really getting five games instead four . so i highly recommend this set if you want play some good , but not so modern games spend little money	1
lot online reviews say this game only half good , but it my favorite game play wii . doing tricks stunts truck just lot fun . you get bonus points ramming your opponents . if it only like real roads ..	1
bully isn't game kids , i mean since it bad example them . i mean you cause trouble school throwing stink bombs or eggs people . plus you get missions like steal panties girls dorm ... gym teacher lol . it also doesn't teach you go school rules . infact you get many missions break school rules . someone old enough not what i see game though it blast . i mean i thought it game where you school whole time . but no you even get out town eventually even missions there . school stuff fun but you get tired only there . i also like how game seasonal how it halloween one part christmas part . without doing missions you just class or flirt girls or start random fights , or pick locks lockers . plus you start fights those hallway geeks who chase you around if you even second late class . they then bring you class if they catch you . all grand theft auto games basically all seeming exactly same despite different missions it nice see fresh game rock star games . i wouldn't recommed this any parent pick up their kid though . well unless they their 20 lol mature enough not what they see game .	1
well after all media attention bully arrived . it would seem all those nutty parental groups wrong again . may now they'll focus some real problems facing our poor children . not only this game prove not " columbine " handbook it tries show better way deal problems facing teens . well rant over now rave . game mechanics excellent . like many rockstar titles they've improved gta engine allowing smoother play . stepping away mission types gta series bully better ideas without falling back gta typical ta/wholesale killing . now don't get me wrong i enjoy gta series , most rockstar other releases . i never passed shop class though . seeing gta open ended engine applied series just shows me various directions they go far game creation . mini-games fun addictive . i wish they would other classes represented . bully you get not only play great game , but some us old folks travel back simpler time . overall this excellent game , worth your time , fine example how stupid media those parental groups .	1

i've playing ncaa 2007 few weeks now , here my thoughts : 1 ) game simply good job capturing feeling it sport any other game . anyone who big-time sec game understands stadium shake . 2 ) i not play " career " mode , i simply prefer control over whole program . 3 ) gameplay very strong , anyone who played ncaa or madden past notice tightening up controls . 4 ) i personally not like first person camera special teams plays , it makes it frustratingly difficult return kicks . 5 ) likewise i could without auto slo-motion " key " plays . it absolutely destroys flow play highlight catch or hit during play . ea , that what replay . 6 ) system annoyingly apt hit me unsportsmanlike conduct penalties , not just td but simple catches or defensive plays . 7)you now more control over recruiting in-season recruiting , including mulitple pitches on-campus visits . 8)after all these versions ea come up new set unlockables . changing logo , or sponsor (!) not new unlockable make	1

overall , i am pretty happy this unit . my only complaint it little underpowered far grabbing my router signal . my laptop 5 bars basement , but i typically only get two xbox 360 this adapter . because this , it drop its signal occasional my linksys wrt54gs router . however , it also 50 ft . away ( assuming direct line ) two floors several walls way . still , using this unit much better than figuring out how hardwire my xbox two floors away . setup breeze . i plugged it ( it snaps nicely into back 360 plugs into nearby usb using short cord ) , went network setting 360 , selected wireless slot , found my network , typed my wpa key my router . . it took all 5 minutes start finish . until buying this , i just dragged 100 ' ethernet cable down steps through doorways anytime i wanted connect xbox live . what pain ! this not perfect solution if you lot space stuff your router xbox 360 , but fine my needs , which mostly includes downloading xbox marketplace , occasional online play . if you avid xbox live player , you setup like mine , you might want consider hardwire solution . you may ocassionally lose your signal middle game .	1
when i first heard this game , i basically ignored it . then , when i visiting gamestop one day , i decided buy it . i instantly amazed unique battle system , bright cheerful backdrops , ( except twilight town , ) challenging profound gameplay . i not played first one , but i probably get it virtual console wii . one problem game it too short	1

what i mean here 3 half stars which my little scheme things means good pretty clearly outweighs bad i recommend it bit enthusiasm . 4 star games very rare me this game made good run it . i can't even imagine 5 star game . i've come think there too many inherent problems games 5 stars . anyway , ahem , this gun . very nice game i looked forward lot . i played it just after it came out hopefully havent forgotten too much i t.t he positives : graphics ! this seems bit controversial some people complain them , but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism detail . gun detail not like , i dont know , half life 2 or something . i didn't repeatedly go " wow , unbelievable todays technology ! " but i really enjoyed them . they pretty look , they set scene well they extremely refreshing- bright , colorful , open western vistas instead dark , gloomy , tense , industrial , claustrophobic filled horror creatures commandos like , i don't know , 95% all shooters . it lovely ride my horse around spotting buffalo hot springs such . i appreciated quite bit . difficulty : well , i can't remember if this game difficulty levels . but i like difficulty levels make bee line easy choice ! i not like dying ! even if i reload right away , i am not too great these games . well , so , up until last part game ( more later ) i no real problems generally felt clever talented but not coddled unchallenged . poker too easy though i could not get hunting gave up it part way through ( i thoroughly completed everything else ) . characters/voice acting : pretty good characters helped superb voice acting . i don't want any spoilers here so i'll just say quality characters let down storyline , but i still liked them . they looked pretty good me . gameplay : it quite fun varied . it some best bullet time ever ( called quickdraw or something ) . i loved how you could flick target target single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised speed mowing down enemies way made it less ridiculous i beating 11 people gunfight . horse riding very well it nice pony express . i liked poker it though found it bit limited , both ranching mining really nice helped fill out world variety things you . length : i may exception , but vast majority games go too long me . feel them things i them become redundant i don't finish , so i like gun seemed manageable . most part i pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things little too cut dried , like way you get every upgrade possible . negative : story : it should gone bit lighter , i mean , it seemed think it some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games not capable pulling off anything nearly sophisticated . they just too much their plate vis vis gameplay choice . cutscenes acting nice , it started solidly , but storywise it progressively deteriorated , or i guess completely unable fufill its set up . it gets little hard discuss without spoilers but , well , more romance would nice boss battle goes not just difficult me ( remember how i hate ! ) , but it irritatingly stupid , senseless reality game . conclusion : wow , only one big negative , but huge , long , ending boss battle really bugged me . really , good game though . oh , way , i pretty midlevel computer ( fading fast ) didn't any real technical problems , maybe couple ugly frame slowdowns , but mostly it smooth . that just , you know , what that worth . anyway , if some what i am talking makes sense you go try this game out	1
i guess this good buy , especially when corporate vice president chief xna architect microsoft says so . i just thought it interesting when allard gave review this product amazon.co	1

okay , first all , this game very violent game , i would not recommend parents buy it children under 13 . you must also make sure they know violence crime fake . there serious consequences doing these things real life , they know not what they this game . back game , this simply , hands down , best game ever created . it innovation within innovaton . storyline excellent , you get betrayed shot your friend during bank robbery . later , you must work your way through dark streets liberty city , working your way toward ones who betrayed you . missions never repeat themselves , they always fun challenging . but , you not able beat this game without codes , i not know anyone who . so i strongly advise you get codes before playing . other than , sense freedom this game gives you after all missions astounding . you go almost anywhere , almost anything , something never before acheived video game . gameplay- 5+- extremely fun addictive , especially when you group your friends around you see your crazy runs law laugh you drive your car off cliff into ocean ( nothing beats feeling when you watch your friend same thing ) . sound- 5- radio stations great , especially game fm . commercials extremely hilarious , you even make your own custom radio station your own tunes . graphics- 4- allright , but could better . storyline- 5- great story , very fun missions . i really congratulate rockstar their acheivment video game industry . great job guys . people reading this , if this game its way your house right now , click buy button above . bottom line- wow	1
castlevania whole started one thing mind . . . kill vampire plaquing land . same said castlevania : curse darkness . you play hector , devilforge master . what devil forge master you ask ? person ablity create monsters/and or weapons . devil forge masters this game same amount power dracula right hand man , death . huge 3d like invorments(like loi ) , wild monsters , gorgeous graphics , suporior sound track help hector way get revenge love his life rosaly . far story line time , this happens little after castlevania 3 : dracula curse . so other words , you old school guys(like me ) enjoy seeing what happeded after castlevania 3 . pick it up today , you not sorry . oh yea i mention , you get play trevor belmont ? oh i didn't , good luck , make dracula pay !!	1
castlevania : curse darkness game even die-hard castlevania fan might not much get into . lament innocence wasn't terrible game , but it wasn't great . curse darkness just goes show when 3d castlevania game marches forth , it problems . sometimes scary problems . like lament innocence , it so much potential good -- this title more so . but it doesn't deliver , that sad revelation admit , especially after so much enjoyment ds smash : dawn sorrow . ever since 1997 all time best , symphony night , so many main characters series like alucard some way . hector curse darkness no exception . he looks little like alucard . but we're not here discuss . hector devil forgemaster , one who given up his powers . dracula dead , but land overun curse monsters world valachia . hector , however , isn't concerned what kind shape world . he more concerned evil devil forgemaster name issac , who killed his beloved . if you couldn't guess , it time revenge . so issac leads hector into place full traps obstacles he must overcome . doing so , hector slowly recover his devil forgemaster skills whatnot . story actually unfolds excellent voice-acting , but there isn't much story . since symphony night we've given this metroid style exploration when it comes castlevania . this marvelous , once again , makes its way into 3d world castlevania . you explore large castle riddled goodies . this includes weapons , subweapons , armor much more . playing game quite fun . most game , you might guessed , spent running through endless hallways defeating monsters . isn't boring you might think . you perform some cool looking combos enemies , but each one must finished button . you also lock onto enemies perform combos . this makes camera go crazy , though , but this forgiveable . battling without locking actually much better , it isn't too hard without . although , if you want steal your enemies , you'll lcok ' em . speaking stealing , it nice you actually . many time monster leave himself open stealing . this usually occurs while it recovers taking damage . again , you must locked it happen . likewise , unlike lament innocence , they actually use level up system . other words , there actually point battling through hordes monsters this time . you also little helper monsters . you compare them familiars found other castlevania games ( like symphony night dawn sorror ) , but better comparison would pokemon . they lend their assistance gain experience defeating enemies , just you . it nice not go it alone , but we castlevania veterans would prefer go it alone . each enemy also drops evolution crystals . collect enough them your monster evolve . you won't grow like them , though . that sad part , they don't really enhance gameplay . monsters special abilities , though . golem like creatures open heavy doors , imps let you bury underground . but you can't help but admit it would nice if your little innocent devils actually characters . also , no evolution crystal same . you take advantage system collecting different types crystals seeing how your little buddies evolve . one nice things devil forger , you make your own weapons ! hector it any time he wants ! that right , no running back some stupid shop it ! monsters often drop raw materials , you use them make new weapons or make your current weapons stronger . you this simply opening menu . i don't know you , but that pretty satisfying me able tha t.t he weapons their own little downside however . exception sword , none them highly helpful combat . you start game off short sword , you'll grow accustomed its fast speed easy use . other weapons just aren't fast enough , enemies aren't weak certain weapon " type " . this makes weapon crafting system little useless some points . unless you're person who likes use " cool " looking weapons opposed swift powerful weapons , you won't much use weapon crafting system , except power up your sword . thus , experimenting weapons garners no fun . it pretty cool , i must say , venturing somewhere isn't dracula castle . instead you actually venture through world valachia . meaning you'll trek through swamps , mountains , valleys lot more . so if you're tired dracula castle , this quite change . problem this " world " you don't see enough it . there not enough detail it . you follow beaten path ( so it isn't really different than dracula castle lament innocence ) , so you can't go off just explore places you're . game also suffers what lament innocence suffered : lack detailed enviroments . you'll no doubt run down same path/hall/corridor several times over . if it weren't map you'd find yourself lost , thinking you must one those " looping " ares , or you took wrong turn ended up running circle . monsters also not so great . what i love 2d castlevania games ( especially new dawn sorrow ) how much variety thrown into monsters . attacks they use you . even if they're same looking monster , they throw some new attack you don't expect . curse darkness ( like lament innocence ) no variety . you'll run into same batch monsters constantly , they'll never something new . later game you'll find yourself fighting nothing but reincarnates different colored monsters nothing new . likewise , all monsters you'll ever see encountered pretty early . moment you run into axe armor , you've run into ' em all ! they'll never change . i sound like i'm picky enemies thing , but i'm not . it takes away challenge game . fact reincarnates don't anything new makes it more true . that not worst part : game overall just isn't challenge . bosses , times , but if you've playing 3d action games , i think you'll find even more challenging bosses no challenge all . early boss battles game fairly easy . later , however , they get start get hard , that when battling them actually becomes fun . again , though , if you're action/adventure pro , you'll probably beat most them your first try . i wish i could say graphics great . hey , hector looks great combat . but enviroments don't enough detail . too many them simple everyday enviroments we've seeing long time now . where detail ? you know ... like ... maybe leaves tree moving ? we're point where there could some kind interation enviroment , instead it seeming like we're running through still-life painting . visually , it doesn't look half bad . it just there could so much more . bosses look cool , framerate doesn't slow down all , but there isn't enough variety , or detail . however , i must say this : music sounds aweseome ! usual , castlevania games some best music there heard gaming ! it better than symphony night ? no , it not . it isn't better than lament innocence either ( which also steller music ) , but it still among best you'll ever hear video game . likewise , voice acting actually really really good ! i just wish i could've heard more it ! curse darkness potential good game . but there lot things keep it down . it fairly fun game play , but it lacks innovation . you won't able separate it other action/adventure 3d games . it got nothing makes it stick out . if you must this game , however , i'd say wait price drop . if you're really looking good castlevania game , i'd suggest getting hold " dawn sorrow " . it much better game . good : +great music ! some best gaming ! +good weapon system+it pretty fun play+you steal enemies ! +great voice acting ! bad-little innovation-lack cutscenes advance story-too much game gets recycled too fas t-t oo easy-the game doesn't look bad , but there little imagination environments-not whole lot different enemies-it too easy-boring level designs ( not enough them)-you just can't help game almost no innovation ! it no different than your average action/adventure 3d gameget dawn sorrow , or one other 2d versions game . they seem fare so much better than this one . even die-hard fan castlevania admit this one rather bland	1
i loved game . characers great . worlds interesting , it still deosnt look outdated . combat fairly strategic . unfortuneatley games ending rather lack luster	1
it works really well their no problem cable enhanced quality picture much better original a/v cables	1
if you switch xbox 360 , buy this game first your last xbox game , you won't disappointed . this game best graphics i ever seen console . although it great graphics , physics real selling point . you pick up virtually anything world throw it around or stack it gravity gun ( zero-point energy manipulator ) . barrels float water like they should explosions suprisingly realistic . enemies challenging varied dead bodies flop around like they should ( especially when you shoot them shotgun ) . voice acting very well characters turn look you if you move around . only drawback choppy framerates times . highly recommended	1
i very eager get this title import , knowing it somewhat ' unique ' terms it genre label - yes it rpg elements , but it something quite separate . i only wish there more such games ps2 or any format matter . this storytelling , videogame-style , it best , capcom/clover produced real gem , it experience , like zelda , highly enjoyable slice fantasy sure hold you it thrall some 50 hours or more , visual treat beautiful soundtrack also . if you consider yourself gamer then get this , it destined cult status , word superb ..	1
i can't get enough okami ! i've beaten it am started second play-though . any action-rpg game fan least try this game ! title basically says it all . it typically japanese play words , since , depending how you translate it , " okami " mean either " wolf " or " king gods " . those people whom not enough information really understand game , here basics : 100 years before game beginning , huge 8-headed dragon monster called orochi menaced small village kamiki . after suffering orochi tyranny years , village champion , nagi , white wolf village dubbed shiranui , defeated orochi . shiranui died his wounds after fight , village built shrine him . peace reigned 100 years , until evil suddenly mysteriously reappeared ... you control shiranui reborn quest save land evil . you travel all over land nippon ( which japanese " japan " ; how original ) fighting monsters , helping people , healing nature curse evil . story nothing new , both very linear quite predictable . but it very well , mixing japanese mythology into classic hero story , generous helping humor give it flavor . story one major downside , though : it told through cut scenes contain bucket-loads exposition . you often find yourself button-mashing desperately try speed things , not work very well because important cut scenes don't let you speed up dialogue . instance , very first cut scene opens game literally takes least 15 minutes get through before you get action . most rest not nearly long , but several them take good 5 minutes least . say it gets tedious understatement . still , cell-shaded graphics largely make up tedious cut scenes . they very beautiful , yet simplistic style evokes traditional japanese ink painting . despite simple style , though , level detail outstanding . fact , it so detailed there occasional spot graphical slowdown . this game really pushes hardware ps2 its limits . music sound also fantastic . most music evokes traditional japanese art much graphics , while sound effects range wolf barks footfalls wind blowing gently through trees , more . mood always set perfectly whatever environment you're visiting . except , possibly , voices . rather than real voices , people talk form gibberish sounds like someone trying talk underwater . while it not bother me personally , some people simply not listen these voice effects . either you'll hate voice noises passion , or you won't care all . either way , this not good point game . controls take bit getting used , but when you gotten used them they become second nature . unlike " legend zelda " games , there no enemy lock-on during combat . instead , you automatically target closest monster(s ) when you push attack button . this simplifies combat without turning it into button-mashing cake walk . it works perfectly ... unless you get hit controller bug . yes , * bug * game . thankfully rare , i only encountered it twice 60+ hours game play . still , when it happens it extremely annoying . during combat , while you're wailing away monster , options-menu suddenly open no reason . usually , analog control your controller also go crazy , either just turning off or madly flickering off . either case makes game impossible play , course , since you control your in-game avatar left analog stick . first case easy fix ; just turn analog control back exit menu . second case , you only fix it literally unplugging controller then plugging it back . far more common than controller bug load times . they usually not terrible , but it seems like loading screen comes up least every five minutes or so . these long cut-scenes , you might sometimes wonder if there actually any game play included . but there * * game play , it lot fun . there great deal keep you occupied , compelling story line many treasure hunts , races , puzzles , mini-games . fighting save world , you go fishing , feed animals , catch thieves , lot more . plus , after you beat game once it unlocks lots extras , including image galleries sound track . all wonderful atmosphere definitely make this game worth checking out . rent it before you buy it , if possible , make sure you deal long cut scenes , numerous load times , weird voice effects . but if you fan action rpgs like " legend zelda " , you definitely want add okami your game library . summary : pros : - great story- great graphics- great music/sound- wonderful atmosphere- lots culture mythology give it flavor- plentiful activities mini-games- unlockable extras after beating gamecons : - occasional graphic slowdown- too much exposition- tedious cut-scenes- lots load times- rare controller bugneutral : - voice noises you might or might not hateover-all score : five stars fun-fun-fun ! but three stars over all because many problems	1
its no secret i'm not fan point clicks . they seem harder , general , my computer than 3-d action games , which something i'll never understand ( unless it copy-protection software ) . i've played through three or four drew games . " secret old clock " most fun me . i liked golf game , sewing project ... i actually proud when i finished sewing side quest . i liked driving around car . retrospect its analogous guiding magnet through maze . i fun none-the-less . i stumbled little cb radio ... got little convoluted bizarre , but i it . other games either too hard or too easy . this one keep you occupied little while ... this one employ element fun . mar	1
i really enjoy this game , i think they could better , some driving chases just seem bit silly . i enjoy more tactical work he required . however , i ran into glitch i went online found there others who same problem where you get totally stuck cannot move forward all . i played 2 nights row thinking i something wrong before i looked up walkthrough online found out it just glitch game . one i followed instuctions , i finally able move so watch out . it right after you go up watch tower sniper rifle , then enter wharehouse protect madsen which soon you enter there should lot men coming , my problem only 1 guy or other people say no men all , if happens then you hit glitch because lot men should come rushing . instructions i followed follows : turn your ps2 turned off game memory card , then load game ( it should 4:28 . if its not , see note below ) . when cut scene jack tony begins remove memory card " warning , memory card removed use save game option manually save progress re-enable autosave ? " press ok re-insert memory card , then watch cut scene . " previously 24 " dialog box appear , press . then play game usual . if correctly , many men enter . after you complete mission , make sure you save it . note : if your memory card 4:41 . go restart mission save during cut scene . you overwrite 4:41 back 4:28 . it helped me if it happens you , believe me , you glad you read this because i sure .	1
first off i own both nba 2k6 nba live 2006 playing both since they come out . first i thought nba live 2006 better game until i played nba 2k6 more more realized it best simulation basketball game out there . addition shot stick this year game changes way you shoot well play game . game very enjoyable especially friends because some games get very intense . overall game probably best series because it made major improvement over espn 2k5 . pros-graphics best any basketball game ps2 date . -free throws more realistic you must fluid motion if you shooting free throw yourself . -vip very extensive detailed show your stats tendecies which very nice touch those pay attention detail such myself . cons-steals happen way too often . -very challenging get 15+ rebounds . -practice mode still relatively useless other than perfect your timing your shot .	1
graphically , this game work art . shiny surfaces , glowing lightsabers , vibrant colors make this winner . far gameplay those , you even forget graphics ! this gameplay so good , you could play it terrible graphics , still aweseome time ! score john williams highlight . music enhances tension , action , drama this game . overall , this best star wars game i ever purchased or played	1
i liked ssx series , sequel 3 best , but i didn't play racers . i bought first nfsu disliked choppy animation . i got part two just out curiosity i liked it so much i beat game . basically , you newbie bayview city you race different type races build rep your car . you must tune your car each type race you must check shops frequently . there various shops , visual effect paint shops ones which improve your car speed , handling etc . races also different : you races isolated tracks , races live trafic , street races confined cramped space without nitro option , lot dirty driving hitting ; short tracks which you win if you shift gear time , my favorites , drift races , which you win if you get most points , not if you pass line first . drift races won breaking steering order make long trail . i used automatic shifting i set game difficulty easy since i don't play racers . i 93 percent i got into race which unmarked map . it 6 circuit race against boss final one . some advice beginngers : if you can't find races map , go garage check out world map option you'll get list all races per level . if you beat them can't find any more races , upgrade your car or get some stars visual rating getting ' cosmetics ' ( new parts like spoilers , lights , new paint ) you'll get offer magazine cover or dvd . if you still stuck , cruise town find unmarked races	1
all these people complaining horrible picture quality must some pretty crappy tv . i mean , it could i 20-inch sony trinitron halo special edition xbox , too , but .... i absolutely no problems it neither any my friends ( real life ) , or anyone my counterstrike clan ( xbox live ) old tv regular xboxesreccomendation : if picture crappy , buy new tv	1
i first got this game 2 years ago computer . back then , i really slow computer , it didn't work right . i so mad i wasted 40 dollars it . it went shelf waited there 2 years . now i better computer play it all time . earlier reviewer said game extremely difficult , not so . guy must obviously moron , not able figure out puzzles , because game average difficulty , if he wants it easier , he play padawan . anyway , game basically first person shooter based game , where you go around blasting storm troopers , probe droids , more . i suggest getting this game because i really enjoy playing it , i want get it xbox too	1
... but game too simple too short . i like creature kapu cave better than danger design . while i appreciate quality graphics , sound effects , music , it seems like producers nancy drew games changed hands recent years . we're seeing stark difference newer games compared their past games such : shadow ranch , danger deception island , treasure royal tower , etc . ( those games fantastic ! ) recent games , play not fluid , tasks too simple-minded , there not much mystery or suspense ( if any ) , game play time too short . ' creature ' , you collect shells make necklaces you go fishing - long you want ! or until you get bored it . beach water graphics cool . there some humor some character conversations . i enjoyed . you get move four locations intertwine make sense . i didn't see any problem auto-switching ( via cell phone calls ) nancy hardy boys . not problem me . i almost rated this 3 star , but gave it 4 due graphics , characters , variety locations . hopefully , her interactive hear their customers disappointments revamp upcoming games . fans want nancy drew games keep coming	1
what you say " katamari damcy " except it exciting , original , fun , edgy !. i totally recommend this any video game fan love games edge something different new !. . . - don't delete this game when you because you need convert your progress " we love katamari " .	1
unlike any other game you've ever played -- best possible way . i am easily bored and/or grossed out traditional racing , shooting , killing zombie games this game refreshing change . challenging enough keep you entertained quite long time . other reviewers said it ends too soon , but game lets you repeat each level beat your previous best score . so , if you barely beat level , you it over until you totally blown it out water . perfect pair obsessive-compulsives like my fianc� me . he thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than i his 6-going-on-7-year-old-son loves it , too . there isn't anything would inappropriate any age , but kid younger than 6 or 7 probably wouldn't get it . ( after he goes bed we play insanely gory jaws game -- you get shark !! ) you might think rolling up stuff make big ball would get old fast , but king all cosmos keeps it exciting challenges surprises . levels just get cooler cooler . also , music fantastic . it you singing no time . na na na na na na na na katamari damashi ! it doesn't even make sense but i love it ! i just ordered second katamari game , " we love katamari . " `nuff said .	1

this really fun game . it got quite lot . graphics , length , characters , story ... graphics : 8/10 dayum ! reminds me dating sims ... but , nice . characters crisp special ingredient known anime eyes ! sound : 7/10 voices ( or lack ) nice . scolding nurse kinda funny . music isn't nice ... theirs only 4 different music thingys i only liked one ... one plays when doing normal guiltstory : 8/10 i wish i could've normal surgeries awhile before encountering super parasite thing based off 7 deadly sins ... controls : 9/10 it ds ... touch , drag , touch again . pretty simple ... overall : 9/10 nice game that easy understand hard master . but this not game kids . blood isn't bad there isn't much gore , but it very hard game beat ! there suicidal patient which my mother didn't really like =\	1

despite all controversy over its violent content , grand theft auto series videogames deliver time after time best entertainment bang your buck . my opinion grand theft auto : vice city best game out series so far . yes , missions bit easier than those san andreas , but vice city better overall experience . setting beautiful , there more properties you own , automotive , firearm weapon selections also quite large . soundtrack this game amazing . 80 pop metal old school rap hillarious talk radio , its all here . grand theft auto greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun , challenges , elements real life triumphs consequences one well produced package	1
if you want workout home , want it fun , already ps2 , i would recommend this video game	1

amazon.com listed this " king quest compilation " instead " king quest collection " which clearly printed my box game , well picture website . i don't know why . game itself , i remember loving king quest games when i younger . i bought this game mostly " king quest vi " which so far seemed work fine , exception one time when game kicked me out no apparent reason . this particular version " king quest vi " also seems draw it graphics original release game not cd release later , so also somewhat disappointing . captain saladin no longer looks like lassie . overall , it nice access these games nostalgia	1
xenosaga ii-jenseits von gut und boese came november europe first xenosaga , which released here !!! but we european players never played xenosaga i before , so namco released second xenosaga great " special box " . this box game itself movie-dvd nearly all xenosaga i movies . back topic , my opinion xenosaga ii pretty game cool movies battle system makes fun . music this game composed yuki kajiura movies shinji hosoe rest game . i think kajiuras music really good but shinji hosoe bad job , his elevator music ;o )the graphics okay but i couldn't see anything outstanding . end i must say , xenosaga ii good rpg , even if it not so wonderful than first xenosaga . that reason , why i imported xenosaga i your country ^_ ~ but last most pal-players happy , actually ( my dictionary doesn't give me right english translation " ueberhaupt " ;_; sorry ) xenosaga ii come europe yet !!!! so i look forward third last xenosaga hope , this episode like first !!!! many greets germany ..... viele gruee aus deutschland ^	1
i played call duty 2 through through . i unlocked all achievements now i feel kind sad . i want more . this game simply fantastic , graphics gameplay . i actually felt like i thrown back time fight nazi . fire fights intense , since enemy units not retarded . they use cover effectivly even try get better postioning you . it may seem like no big deal but game developers promising smart ai years never deleviring until now . i unfortunitly not ability play xbox live so muliplayer very limited me ... what i play fantastic . its not ground breaking lack vehicles kind crappy ... but no big deal . okay ... if you xbox 360 you might well get this game . its best i played so far	1
we've all heard final fantasy 8 final fantasy 10 , but anyone ever mention game ? final fantasy 9 , sadly , most underestimated game final fantasy series . it one pulled me into my ff fandom , though it around 6 years old i still love it . reason it not famous others probably because ff9 came out playstation just before playstation 2 came out . storyline spellbinding -- it captures you right beginning flows beautifully , through cities eternal rain , clashing monsters , ( traditional plot theme almost every rpg alive ! ) fate world itself . everyone relate ff9 characters , who struggle find who they or where they belong end , find , or almost find , meaning stunning finale . then you'll find yourself cheering them ( or mourning over them if you become attached one who dies . ) music ? nobuo , you've outdone yourself . ff9 songs masterpieces , you'll find yourself humming you're not alone or melodies life without knowing it . course , couple pieces bring back amusing scenes just mentioning their name . ( slew love letters , anyone ? )any cons ? hard question . if there problem , then i can't target it . perhaps leveling up your character may take while , but then again that traditional part every ff game so it shouldn't counted . able play few " legendary " characters(fratley , beatrix ) would great , but would take away their status , wouldn't it ? ( that opinion , so i'll let it slide . ) i think this until my head explodes , but i won't able target actual flaw . i , lyrit , find final fantasy 9 perfect rpg game . overall , again , this got greatest ff game out there . i've played most others popular series now , but they just don't strike me like ff9 . wait . what you listening me ? get ff9 play it . once you , my review look like it degrading this game	1
i same opinion everyone else , controller very convenient , appealing , affordable fun , but ...... it suddenly stopped working .... i think there some problems wireless connection , its very frustrating middle action boom .... your controller stops respondind ..... you get killed ..... it sucks !!! i see lot people same problem i .... what i solve it , changing batteries then putting them back again , or use dual shock while then plug logitech again ... worked me ..... it sounds silly but somehow works .... so , if you want great wireless controller , this it , but aware this problem little annoying you probably it too ......	1
shipment came fast , packaged well , all great thin	1
this game rocks , you've got action , storytelling , quests , your own path , linear gameplay , world alive , people jobs work times play times . controls little quirky , but worth hassle	1
i found this fun game well effective . i enjoyed various activities truly felt several them increased my concentration abilty increase my speed . i particularly like it when it got level where i could choose which games i wanted use my brain age tests . several games going require more repetitions before i become skillful them . i find i continue working game instead putting it down after short time because lack interest . carole adan	1
i typically don't write reviews but gamer seeing negativity here - i felt compelled post my thoughts . red steel truly fun game . it definitely its flaws but , owner 7 launch games , i extend statement every one . i think it provides truly unique experience once you get knack controls , it becomes intuitive nothing like you've ever experienced before . ability replicated sword movements gun movements kept me game 2 days straight . my personal opinion if you not like this game ... you simply not like what wii . if this your type genre - it must buy	1
this game great . both missions things you your own ( like extortion ) make this game awesome part anyone collection . i only found one thing wrong game . when you reach rank " don " , everyone still talks you i you bottom barrel . instance , when talking one corleone men , they still say something like , " hey kid stay outta trouble " . this game , although great , still use little fine tuning .	1
you know , it quite some time since i've found myself glued videogame where my mind hours become seconds . i say myself i'm only going play few minutes -- fifteen , tops -- next thing you know , three hours gone . last game me " gta : san andreas . " i thought there would never game would hook me like . i wrong . boy , i ever wrong . " godfather " ps2 addicting gripping game throws you into world mafia links you classic storyline found film . you play older son score settle . your father wiped out don barzini right front you when you little . don corleone tells you when you're old enough , you take your revenge . now all grown up , you aim serve your godfather move up ranks outsider becoming made man then some . if you're clever enough , you might even become don . if you're ruthless enough wipe out all your enemies , you become don ny . decision up you . game gives you classic storyline we all love know movie , only it involves you . missions very familiar famous scenes we seen over over again . not only , but gta fashion you given lot freedom things your own . you shake down rival businesses using various " negotiation tactics . " need some extra cash ? rob bank . better yet , hijack rival truck steal goodies inside . you're given giant world interact . whether you decide play missions straight through or some freelancing , many opportunities enjoy game . graphics pretty impressive . players who familiar gta games easier time getting used controls various camera angles . look feel very identical . if you want my honest opinion , i actually enjoy this game lot more than any gta games , but that because i'm such fan movie . it great you get relive your favorite scenes part action . cons : missions tricky sometimes even downright frustrating . good majority them timed so it may take you few times get mission just right . i understand timer some missions , but sometimes they get little ridiculous i feel they're just trying throw some unneeded obsticles your path . good news there tons checkpoints each mission , so if you fail or die you not start all over again . also , game glitchy times . now , i haven't seen anything major disrupts my playing all but i've heard some people earlier copies some major problems , so careful . i could go this game , but i'm sure it all said before . you want my verdict ? i love this game think it blast play . " godfather " bound classic . if you're fan movie or gta games , then give it shot . i beat game twice already , i still find myself playing it all over again more more . if you no free time whatsoever , then stay away . this game consume you , whether you like it or not . you warned . offer made . don't you dare try refuse it if you know what good you . - michael cran	1
i bought this game bit late ( 2 years after it came out)but it still seemed state art me ! loved story , gameplay improved significantlypros -- huge map , 5 massave areas explore-tons vehicles- you might not see same one twice ! -cool new features , like vehicle customization-endless stuff ! -multiplayer modecons -- character customization prosess annoying-if you leave game without pausing , you could bad supprise when you come back ( ie , all your muscle going down)go buy this game , you really like i	1
this game takes place group islands twenty years after events chrono trigger . this game also takes place two parallal worlds hence name chrono cross . this game you ability recruit up 44 characters . get all them you need play through game least 3 times . you probably want play game more times anyway depending how long it takes you understand story line considering it very complex . i wouldn't recommend this game someone who doesn't like rpg or long games . it took me least 50+ hours get through game first time , guide book !!! if you plan getting this game i would also suggest guide book it well . because there somethings you would not find life you unless you something telling where go what . example some characters 7th level tech skills impossible find get without book . you find chrono cross guide amazon well , but beware it usually isn't cheap . if you liked any final fantasy games you would probably like this game well . something else keep mind battle system somewhat different any other game you don't use mp , you use what called elements . these take place magical attacks . there down side elements though when you wish change characters you must remove all elements you character so you place them character . this very time consuming especially later game when you lots element slots fill . beware you this lot . but don't let get you down . this exellant game despite all . all said i would highly recommend this game any rpg fan . hope this review helps .	1

okay , i'll start saying i don't play many role-playing computer games . i'm fan genre , but i tend play strategy/command-and-conquer style games . so , when i picked this one up , i didn't lot compare my experience . i immediately sucked into game , controls not hard learn , despite what review said . character progression cool , giving fair bit control over how you develop both skillwise alignmentwise ( you want good or evil ? it your choice effects how game plays out ) . optional quests main story quests all cool , but i warn you all : final battle way too easy . i beat whole game without maxing most skills , without most really cool legendary weapons , without doing lot side quests . but you continue game world after it ends : just let credits roll aprox . 10 minutes . though , there no new quests , you run around tie up loose ends , like opening demon doors silver key chests .	1
unfortunately xenosaga i - der wille zur macht never come europe . but second xenosaga ( jenseits von gut und bse ) released germany november i very happy . so i played it impressed this cool story gameplay ! i became big xenosaga-fan . after i imported first part series america . now i am playing it i must say , first xenosaga much better than second !!!! it great pity xenosaga episode i never brought out germany europa !! you americans should very happy , so many rpgs come your country ^_	1

i emphasize strategy . what you not find fancy graphics , studio sound , arcade action , cheats , or killer strategy win every time . this game wonderfully balanced 17 nations ( works ) , 1100 units , 400 spells , 400 magic sites , 250 magic items , much more . but neat thing they give you what you need play your style . berserker , defensive , researcher , swarmer , sneak , diplomatic , whatever . instead feeling like you learning strategies developer mind you learn , you actually develop your own tactics surprises . there people who played it over year still come up new things try . ( yes , its one those games which actually survive your machine year	1

square disney coming together bring us video game turned out really good move , i think . kingdom hearts ii improvement over original . maybe not big improvement , but enough consider purchasing . graphics really good difficulty unfortunately , sort easy . game really big contains monster storyline so it not like easiness means you blow through game lazy saturday afternoon . it just means you won't much trouble moving through game . i guess axel fairly challenging fight . some other fights sort difficult , well . i'm not entirely sure what think idea complete certain tasks order progress forward , but i guess it not big deal . worth buying ? absolutely	1
i enjoyed this game quite bit -- i ended up putting all other games i playing aside just finish this one . you play three baudelaire kids . story follows 2004 lemony snicket film fairly closely , you must first escape count olaf decrepit mansion , then avoid killed train before you head off uncle monty herpetology paradise , aunt josephine seaside town , finally save violet baudelaire fate worse than death . environments attractive fun explore , game play puzzles neither too easy nor too challenging frustrating . most game -- you explore environments , solve puzzles , search secret rooms such , you switch violet klaus baudelaire you please . many " important " events , such boss fights , you must play one or other , they each different skills weapons . some sequences -- those basically 2d platformer sections ( entire game some platformer aspects , but it usually loosely employed 3d ) , you must play sunny , baby baudelaire ( this only time you play her ) . various puzzles challenges -- they almost amount series " mini-games " , varied mostly non-repetitive , helping retain your interest . some fairly easy figure out perform , but some appropriately more challenging , both mentally terms manipulating controller , take many tries complete . couple first-person shooter sequences ( game mostly third person mode ) , especially challenging , particularly end , but that final boss fight , so that expected . like most games , winning boss fights requires discerning patterns bosses adapting strategy appropriate pattern , which takes both brains manual dexterity . there couple negatives game , but they minor . games like this , released response success film , often rushed through production . becomes evident here cut scenes , which not very exciting -- they feature 2d black white sketches more like slide show major portions story read us . but i'd rather skimping cut scenes than game play , that just what here . also , although graphics wonderful most part , visuals bit dark overall -- i found it best play lights off . bright overhead light , glare too much see important information game . finally , i would preferred different save game scheme , you only save when game asks if you want , save points seem almost random . sometimes you save after accomplishing only one more minor task . sometimes you long sequences ( sometimes number challenging ones ) before you save again . game isn't quite funny film doesn't exactly same " magical " atmosphere , but it engaging fun journey world . soundtrack , jeremy julian soule , inspired thomas newman great soundtrack film , also major asset -- i found myself wanting explore levels again later much hear music again anything else	1
i can't believe someone would try selling memory card more than 25 dollars . you ripped off if you pay more than 10 dollars one , but unfortunately , if you live country like me , finding store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably nearly impossible . so you're forced shop one online . it really not cool pay all this money * just * save progress my video game . it really dumb .	1
so , if it such excellent game , why 4 stars " fun " rating ? well , it very very fun game , but some parts get annoying aggravating . it seems if different levels difficulty achieved handing you less less health upgrades , which kinda cheap , if you ask me . they physically limit you , instead strategicly doing so . but everything else great it . graphics great , not excellent , but great . sound great too . gameplay excellent story very well developed . kinda easy side normal level , though . but , i guess nothing perfect . go ahead get this one . it worth what it costs	1
if you going play karaoke revolution or any karoake-type playstation 2 game , then you need this mike . headset bundled game neither durable nor practical , mentioned before , it rarely fits everyone . it broke few weeks after i bought game . this logitech mic much better , you true karaoke star without worrying getting too far cord ( it 15 feet ! ) or knocking headset off your head your crazy moves . i'd say only downside volume 4 , when you sing dance you get entangled cord if you're not careful . but i just bought one our kr game i'm get so we duets :	1

i love good , intricate storyline game much next person . rpg , known it generally intricate plotline , one my favorite genres . incredible hulk ultimate destruction credit , it contain story penned seasoned comicbook author . again game credit , story really isn't too bad ( fairly generic , but servicable ) . script voiced adequatly , presented way doesn't deter real focus game : rampant , wanton , gratuitous destruction some most creative ways possible . i love hulk character . i even liked ang lee flick ( no hate mail please-myfriends give me enough crap one it ) . there something cathartic nearly indestructable creature operates pure id . who doesn't want just lose it when we get pushed too far ? this game many things going it : it controls very well , nearly every object vast varied environments destructable some way shape or form , graphics certainly servicable ( although not top-notch ) . best way describe this take open gamespace like grand theft auto games , minus infuriatingly difficult missions , add set missions beg you destroy everything . every mission based some way premise you giant green demolition expert . now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly , but game remain fresh large part huge selection upgraded moves you ' buy ' smashpoints , which awarded via smashing things ( deep huh ? ) . it really massive orgy soothing mayhem , mercy it ever satisfying ! if you tried out first hulk game , please aware this nothing like . there no more tedious sneaking missions bruce banner . you hulk , jade giant absolute gas this title . like gta games , you not forced into playing missions ( although this unlock new moves arenas play ) . you take side quests which not only pretty creative , but downright hilarious others ( try ' batter up!' example latter ) . if first hulk game ang lee movie left sour taste your mouth when it comes mr. green genes , then give this one shot . my opinion , they got essence hulk down pat , show him fun character he . later !	1

i'll admit able go around stormtrooper kill everything sight fun . wicked fun . this game delivers if you want good time playing fps involving star wars . major drawback game targetting . it like using sniper rifle halo 1 but reticle size one assault rifle . you turn auto-aim option help accuracy but then reticle tends follow enemy screen it more difficult shoot over ally shoulder . drawback you can't jump/fall shoot same time like other fpss . plus , fighters hard learn how use other vehicles . you still fine footsoldier but it would nice if vehicles little easier use	1

reason i liked this game so much story line . it gives you choices whether you want go light side or dark side you could enhance variety jedi powers . i played this game serveral times each time different . first time i went through this game i relied lot my swordsmanship my lightsaber . second time i played this game i relied more my jedi powers . either way you play it i developed different set moves . it awesome ! also i love fact you play woman !! every other star wars game ( except this sequel)you play man it gets little irritating when you like adventure games just much any guy . i give story line capabilities jedi five stars	1

much hyped final fantasy iii ds finally here , ds owners ff fans alike should clicking their heels . now , let me start off saying this not final fantasy iii you played , loved , worshipped super nintendo years ago ; game re-released final fantasy vi advance gba eventually ( hopefully ) . this instead real ff iii which never made it here overseas , it remade restructured fit perfectly nintendo smash hit handheld . graphics given big facelift , that saying it lightly . character sprites replaced full 3-d effects look great ds game , storyline tweaked well . everything else ff iii old school rpg gamer dream come true , even if touch screen features feel tacked unnecessary . everything else ff iii though pure delight , wi-fi features nice say least . all all , ds owners looking excellent rpg pass time should look no further ; their prayers answered	1
ico game very different others . it focused puzzle solving short but unforgettable story mixed fantastic visuals audio . imagine what ico would if action incorporated into it , you would something like shadow colossus , ico prequel . sotc colossal achievement many different levels . presentation : you stand front deceased woman whose identity unknown told defeating 16 colossi roam land , you may able revive her ... but it may come price ! this sets up shroud mystery surrounds sotc you start your journey . you given nothing but bows arrows , sword , your trusty horse agro . graphics : land sometimes colorful , but it supposed desolate so you won't see much life here . real kudos goes animation occurs during boss bottles . different motion blur affects really bring game new level realism . agro animation also cinema-worthy well . gameplay : meat potatoes sotc gameplay . ride your steed direction colossus begin battle . you 2 bars , grip strength health . grip determines how long you hold things , such colossi themselves . best part gameplay isn't your hands but your mind . each colossus puzzle must solved . it determining it weak spot , or even how get thing . colossus so varied each one keep you guessing what next . while it hard , it one funnest experiences you've ever . audio : some same tracks repeated throughout here , but they never grow old . music seems match mood . when you've just met colossus you'll hear soft music while you figure out what . then music rise you mount beast . all pieces here sound good great pieces . overall : when you've beaten it picked your jaw off ground surprise ending , it not over yet . you time attack mode hard mode which used collect few unlockables . while such modes seem trivial me , i mention this extremely fun experience , so even i go through it again . this absolutely no-brainer , get shadow colossus now	1
really nice headset except fact if your gamer spends alot time xbox live this headset it start hurt little bit . you adjust volume barely able hear person or basically making it seem like they yelling . very small it plug into charger very well if someone says they hold it rubber band or tape then they messed it up somehow because headset stays nice firm . this must people cannot stand cord getting their way their headset xbox live or xb connect/xlink . it very good range ( i walk outside door closed 50 or so steps away i still get reception . ) overall if you xbox want talk other people online get this headset it very nice	1

i've played it countless times arcade i think it one best games ps2 ( cause actually i'm more pc gamer ) amd it best it kind . if youre looking guncon game , this you ! gameplay : i've said , best its kind . tc3 one few guncon games keep you glued tv ( my case , arcade screen ) hours hours wont get repetitive . multi-weapon system give you more strategy less ( good way , ) mindless crazy shooting . example , if you outnumbered closed space lot foes screen , any other guncon game youd shoot them all down one one , ducking like madman losing time but now , youd just select nade launcher , aim , clear area enemies . but , grenade launcher limited amount ammo , so would you spray uzi fast rate fire or use shotgun spreads its bullets ? your choice . but strategy doesnt bore game , you still ave plenty time shoot people silly graphics : graphics arent like half life 2 or doom 3 but its still isnt horrible , anyway , you wont mind graphics when youre really playing game . sound : dialog crappy like any other guncon game , but everything else above par again , you wont care sound when youre really playing gamestory : not best , its predictable , corny it isnt complex all , but if you're looking great storyline guncon game ... you need serious help . overall : only flaws i could find game overpriced , ( 60$) guncon pretty fragile ( what i've heard ) . other than , its must buy anyone who likes shooting , crazy action , or wants let their anger out some terrorists	1

i bought " contact " based positive hype , without knowing much it all . i'm not disappointed . " contact " proven very enjoyable distraction me ever since it came ou t.t he premise game you helping boy called terry who moored deserted island wacky professor . you communicating professor via your ds guiding terry movements ( although he doesn't know you're there ) . terry mission help professor find his ship fuel cells while solving mysteries puzzles , fighting bad guys , gaining skills . this sense , game just like most rpgs , but i believe level gameplay more sophisticated than your typical final fantasy or zelda-type venture . many elements game borrowed those successful series , but they also combined puzzle game elements even " life simulation " elements such those harvest moon . terry recharges energy eating food he finds -- there many different sorts -- sleeping his bed , or taking warm bath . he fight enemies using weapons he picks up . he find interact items clues help him complete his quest go back home . one cutest features he acquire change into outfits enable him use skills like cooking . it not difficult get used intuitive game play , especially after brief read through instructions . you home equally using stylus or console buttons . what interesting me terry collect stick different decals produce various effects , you even peel decals off their backings , like real life , although using stylus . overall , this very interesting kind game , one makes full use ds unique capabilities such dual screens . if you're fan any genres mentioned above , you won't disappointed " contact .	1

i read previous reviews other reviews this games , i agree some disagree others . i like whole story line game . it gave us insight into history jr gaignun shion . i very disappointed overall combat system . i liked changing characters middle combat like ff-x , but i miss ability hit enemies special weapons like first episode . i also disappointed way creators changed way build characters first episode second . i liked characters different abilities . it added diversity building strong team . i didn't care too much good samaritan side quests . i didn't like go all over place pick up stuff vital development my characters or advance game . ability two characters attack during combat using special attacks interesting even though i didn't use it much . far characters themselves , i agree reviewer shion . i also found her bossy cold . certain scenes , i found her too emotional . most her lines near end completely out place especially end after jr showdown albedo . ( i disappointed when my most favorite npc gaignun possessed , but that just me . ) i agree one reviewer voice momo although i like some her lines . i very happy creator took away her wand give her weapon . it made her very useful combat . chaos too laid back me this game kos-mos too much vain side . i like how reaction shion jin or kos-mos before combat starts . overall game enjoyable play . once i got pass disappointing aspects game , i found it very entertaining	1
excellente juego , es una verdadera simulacion de manejo , los graficos son de lo mejor , las pistas parecen reales . es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar	1

i bought disgaea when it first came out thought it great . fun , funny , many long hours game play . when 2 came out , i excited . it didnt let me down . many features improved first game . assembly much more wieldy now . item world more controlled . battle more challenging . they also removed ridiculous overpowered character aka angels majiin took forever unlock only obssesed players get em	1
after playing disgaea 1 , i tried vain satisfy my srpg thirst every game nipponicchi released afterwards , la pucelle , phantom brave , makai kingdom , alas , not one compared greatness disgaea . but it safe say disgaea 2 not only good digaea 1 , but better ! graphics this one better , music takes you back good old days , when rpg music memorable . there few needed tweaks battle system here there . however , there also some additions disgaea 2 some people may or may not like , such item world pirates , incredibly strong characters show up randomly item world make life miserable any unfortunate cross their path . main characters not seem lovable laharl , etna , rest disgaea 1 crew , but i guess they'll grow you after 200+ or so hours your likely spending them . speaking which , i gotta get back now , those very same item pirates just killed adell ..	1
i honestly don't know why everybody so negative regarding this game . i think it phenominal ! great missions , great story game play , variety weapon customization feature makes fun little side quests . overall it great addition ffvii universe i definitely hope see more games these characters coming out soon ! even remake original ffvii would grand ! whole , vincent valentine one bad dude ! bosses interesting cool , links original game awesome ! if you're fan , buy this game . if you're not fan want interesting gaming experience , please consider this title . timewarrior spoken	1
i read poor reviews this game psm magazine yet failed believe them seeing i am hardcore final fantasy fan . i ran store picked this up , popped it my ps2 , awaited review it myself . i seem speak myself when saying this ... but i just think simple games easy just ... fun . this game amazingly fun , just not worth 50$ . i highly suggest renting this game , unless you're ff collecter ( like myself ) . length also dissapointing , seeing i beat it one sitting ( only 4-6 hour game ) . ok ... now more " technical " review : there only three guns , majority entire game spent watching cut-scenes rather than playing ( i'm not exagerrating ) , dungeon design poor predictable ( pretty much just walk forward ) , action consists repeatedly pressing one single button ( no fancy combos , even though they tease you showing vincent pull them off cut-scenes ) , there " jump " command pressing yet only few things actually jumped over or upon , lacks story , etc ... however , music pretty good ( even without uematsu ) , cg great ( advent children quality ) , characterization vincent plus ... if you're looking good game , don't play this ... if you're looking ' fun ' ( meaning easy , simple ) game , or variation final fantasy we all know love ... then i suggest renting this . unless course , i've said before , you simply want buy it its title , or add your ff collection	1

although i don't own my own xbox - i always play someone else because i already own ps2 , i never-the-less feel obligated add my thoughts matter . new xbox controller one sleek piece equipment - far superior original monstrousity controller those idiots microsoft initially came up ( it super ugly , gigantic , clunky original controller turned me off buying xbox when it came out ) . new controller visually appealing eyes . although ps2 controller still slightly more attractive , controller extremely close second . controller smaller handier than original , easier use controls , very comfortable grip . just compare different controllers xbox , ps2 , gamecube holding them your hands , fiddling around controls . you see xbox controller nicest fit them all palms your hands ( gamecube least comfortable ) . ironically controller originally designed xbox release japan because original controller deemed too big japanese players . i really think those folks microsoft should plan things little better before jumping game ...	1
game lot plot development cutscenes . if you into it then that great . i find i scan gist then move next dialogue . said , all backgrounds simply best ever put screen . i find myself actually commenting aloud myself how beautiful game . action good plot suck you . nothing novel battle system , while plot managed surprise me after playing both it predecessors . completely worth your while	1
newcomers saga , jumping board this point time may not worth it . however , if you've already sucked first two , you should find this quite enjoyable . few changes simplifications battle system make battle less chore . story line , course , stillthe main focus ofthe game . so , if you've dying see what happens next our beloved crew ... this game give it you . i , however , not recommend this game those who enjoy gameplay over story line	1
this unfortunatly last xenosaga . much inproved xenosaga ii . game playable once again . it nice some original actors actreses back once again . momo not fortunate enough regain her original voice . few people not happy some scene editting japanese keep rating teen united states but ending enough make up . those fans who really liked first disappointed secound they not finish it game comes recap long your willing read you only lose shion vector uniform not cleared data file xenosaga ii . only let down player we never get chance use kos-mos tertiary weapons . those wings huge cannon seen one . she uses cannon one scene rather early then after it lost . like first secound this one not only really strong biblical links but resolution comes people new testment . ( no not jesus ) all all it great game shion speach end if your sappy emotional person like me leave you crying more than enough play through this game	1
playstation dual shock such comfortable popular layout pc gamepad companies like saitek logitech try copy it , they usually don't very good job . their d-pads always too awkward , or their construction too lightweight . dual shock solid built last . i'm emulation gamer , thanks smartjoy usb adapter i use real ps1/ps2 gamepad zsnes bleem . my only gripes pad : ) start/select buttons really should've moved up after addition analog sticks . i'm always finding myself fumbling over sticks trying get start select . ) while d-pad very sturdy , it kills my thumbs after couple hours play . kinda makes me wish they taken turbo touch 360 approach used touch-sensitive panel instead hard plastic arrows	1
this original playstation controller , it best . it feels great your hands , not too heavy , best button response , overall just best controller you buy . if you thinking buying controller different feeling i strongly reccommend not buy big mad catz controller . it not feel good your hands , its too big heavy , button response sucks . just stick sony controler , it best best	1
wow this game blend final fantasy xi + vagrant story . some armor creatures ffxi . this perfect game me since i miss graphics gameplay ffxi online but i dont 300+ hours my life sink into it so ffxii perfect alternative ex-ffxi online players who life . battle system graphics amazing !! skill development more complex than usual ff games so young teenager might not able build their characters their full potentials . only bad thing i see this game new moogles design ... they look like rabbits now ! who idea it dump pudgy fat hamster design	1
though many hardcore ffvii or ffx gamers may disagree , ffxii simply best final fantasy games . it best reviewed game ps2 one best all time . addressing obvious , graphics , music voiceovers best ( though soundtrack ffvii equal ) . movie cutscenes make you double-take thinking you're playing ps3 game . what really set this game apart in-game control systems . first off , no more fixed camera angles ! seriously , one best parts game . second , battle system . i reluctant first when i saw previews , but it best battle system yet . it fully real-time battles , but it pauses when you're making choices through menu ( great feature ) . you even go into your main menu during battles buy use things called license points power up your character or switch out characters better strategies . it seems most controversial new game system license system . basically you " buy " [ using license points(lp )] license use type weapon or magick , or other type power up . but you get least one lp each creature you kill so it goes fast . many ways it like grid system ffx , however it vastly improves this encompassing complete customability characters . everything weapon type choice health magick powerups up you . frankly no other system beat this [ sorry materia lovers :( ] buy it . last great game playstation 2 .	1
intro . i know some people ( if i may quote other reveiwer , mr. ., ) think this game ' not easy normal humans ' , but seriously , it good game ! don't base it whether level or two challenging . would you like it better if it piece cake ? i sure heck wouldn't . ( fair , i some trouble levels : rift river , some parts planetarium , etc . ) gameplaytak 2 plays very nicely , far games go . environments animals people so nicely , levels varied , not like you're one area whole game . music easily listenable , not like some other obnoxious video game music , example kingdom hearts traverse town music . ( forigve me ! ) fighting system basically button mashing beginning , but it develops you get new juju powers learn combo attacks . i also enjoyed animal changing parts game ... true , some parts unbeliveably annoying ( like when you're flying squirrel , juju runs out you plummet your death kind annoying . ) but i still liked idea able change into bears , squirrels , frogs , boars . this game graphics animators credit . it awesome how tak moves look so realistic when he water , or mud , or tipetoeing , or jumping , or whatever . pros conspros : 1 . amazing animation2 . funny dialouge3 . once , game good music4 . nice fighting system5 . awsome animal changes6 . just darn fun play beat ! cons : 1 . some really hard killer levels ... i ton trouble darts gloomleaf swamp ... bleh . 2 . few glitches bugs this game . 3 . augh ! loading times!overalli'd definitely say buy it , if not rent it . it really fun ton replay value	1
awesome game , loads fun . all guy needs : women , money , cars , power ( not necessarily order :-)	1
this component cable offers clearer , crisper picture my lg lcd hdtv than composite cable . however , it downside . clearer picture exposes edges polygons make up figures games , which you don't see composite cable . it makes them appear little rough , but overall it better picture	1

this game so much fun ! i don't own it , but my friend , i want get it my birthday . but i think i should tell you why exactly anyone needs own this game ! first all , there 50 songs sing . some you unlock , but all you sing already available song . you're rated notes you supposed sing , if you don't exactly know lyrics , you just hum if you want . there character editor where you make your name , characteristics clothing character . or you pick already made character . thing which totally descriptive you pick body type your character : muscular , curvy , skinny ... works . there unlockables , too ! over course game , you unlock songs , outfits , accessories ! you also medly sing-off activities . medly when you pick 5 songs sing individual parts each them . sing-off ( i can't remember if actual name ) when you different types styles game . so you short song , medly , all kinds other things . then you see " who named champion karaoke ! " this game incredibly fun enjoyable , you see . if you buy it , i suggest you buy two microphones , then you sing duets ( also incredibly fun ) . this game perfect all ages ; my neighbors children age 7 he loves singing his heart out some his favorite songs . so take my word it , you thankful you	1
this most unique game recent years . okami mixture different gameplay . prior buying this game i expecting more combat . you control reincarnated god wolf travel thru many beautiful scenaries . you talk people , solve simple fun puzzles , some platforming , collect weapons , play mini-games , fight cool enemies . your goal save ancient japan demons . setting very unique . its japanese mythology cell-shaded graphic which resembles ancient japanese water/oil painting . there cool japanese style towns , cherry blossoms trees , beautiful environment mythological enemies/beast japanese twist . visual pleasing game . you want see what next level looks like , its like traveling ! bosses really cool too ! characters zany funny . one disappointment lack voice acting , you read text ! minus 0.5 points overall score . combat portion not happen during ' normal ' game , there talisman environment when you touch it game switches into combat scenario confined ' border ' . unique aspect this game ' celestrial brush ' . its hard describe this gameplay but you basically draw brush . there many different brush powers . you draw fill missing bridge gap , draw line thru enemies slash them death , or draw circle sky make night turn into day . these few examples . game difficulty pretty easy . overall fun adventure ride everyone , all ages players . graphics : 4.5 /5 , music/sound : 5/5 , story : 5/5 , gameplay : 4/5 , design : 5/5 , fun : 4.5 /5 , value : 5/5 , overall : 4.5 /	1
i've owned this game since 3 weeks after it first came out , i nothing but praise this masterpiece game . after two equally amazing sequels feature so much more than gta 3 , one would think my opinion this game diminished , but it hasn't . i still remember playing this game first time . i'd just sit my room hours staring my mouth hanging open , just taken back everything , such very fun missions , enormous environment , or fact i could just run around whatever i wanted whenever i wanted . fabulous part this game radio . surprisingly , alot these songs actually good . i've never heard any people who sing them , but stations like head radio flashback feature some surprisingly catchy tracks add additional lightness this already darkly humorous game . however , chatterbox probably best , which features ton dry , sarcastic , often hilarious humour . such enormous environment , one would give graphics bit recognition . obviously , their not perfect , there many games much better graphics than this game , but these graphics still pretty damn good . cars look really awesome , all characters , including pedestrians , surprisingly well detailed . however , main thing this game its fun . alot fun . there so much more you rather than just missions . you variety sub-missions , which include becoming taxi driver , law enforcer , ambulance driver , even firefighter , all which allow you earn bit money . guns also really cool , you alot fun them , especially weapons like grenades rocket launcher . thing note this particular game alot glitches , but they aren't evident . example , beginning game you see yourself robbing bank unidentified part some city . well , later , if you manage figure out irritating dodo plane ( that right , there flyable plane ) , you actually find section city . overall , this one best games playstation 2 . pretty much any person who isn't jaded when it comes video games just wants alot fun very long time should buy this game . there isn't much story , but who cares . this game kicks ass , any gamer should buy this . don't rent this game , just go buy it right now . you won't regret it , i promise . one thing note , however , it very violent there fair bit cursing . you also solicit prostitutes , if you drive quiet place , your car start bouncing ( just so parents know ) . mind , game still kicks alot ass .	1
when i first started playing fable i amazed how much possibility there forge your own destiny . where one simple decision could alter your destiny good or evil forever . when you start out young boy who village burned , plundered , entire town murdered , you feel sorry boy his life taken him . then he become hero . you embark long journey make choices way you forge you own personal destiny . well written storyline back it up this game amplifies your freedom forge your destiny .	1

after sixteen long years , final fantasy iii finally sees official release outside japan . however , unlike previous games , final fantasy iii completely reworked . this more than just port enhanced graphics . final fantasy iii includes some new secrets side quests addition its graphical overhaul . final fantasy iii may just enough please some hardcore fans , but wait really worth it ? well , yes , but game isn't perfect . storyline final fantasy iii entirely too simple . crystals losing their powers there only four warriors come forth save world falling into darkness . sixteen years ago this pretty standard story , but when compared your average rpg today , current final fantasy games , storyline final fantasy iii joke . there nothing this story screams epic , characters involved aren't developed very well . luckily , we let it slide because its sixteen years old . gameplay wise , final fantasy iii pretty similar most rpgs today . you'll go roaming through dungeons towns getting into random battles . there few quirks game ds utilizes . you'll find moments where you'll zoom into certain objects you examine . it should also noted you use touch screen almost exclusively game . using stylus you make your character run direction you want him , gliding it across screen . taping things makes your character examine it , ultimately this how you open chests talk people . it works out , but it feels really clumbsy times . if you're looking get through dungeon little hassle , just stick directional buttons . its credit , though , using stylus makes menu navigation much faster , but most part , stylus controls just feel tacked . combat traditional turn based combat . there no atb gauge like later final fantasy games . each round you choose all commands your characters , then watch round battle take place . it simple , but isn't always fun . mainly because final fantasy iii challenge . if you began some later final fantasy games , then this installment may little too difficult . sometimes combat unforgiving , especially when faced bosses attack twice per turn , power take out character single shot . even worse , encounter rate pretty high running away battle often wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying so . you'll probably get wiped out just trying run battle failing so many times . there several moments when you'll forced battle hours just leveling up . this fine those used old school rpgs , but many rpgs today not put so much emphasis leveling up , it may try your patience after while . it great people looking challenge , least , but some it may bit too steep . job system interesting . you go through game you'll get crystal shards allow your characters use certain jobs . each job its own set abilities learned it . example , white mages specialize healing arts , black mages attack magic red mages little bit both . you've also got other classes like warriors who take damage other party members , thieves who steal much more . there 23 jobs all , possibilities nearly endless . jobs you choose your characters also impact your stats . mages , example , don't lot strength but they excel magic . also , you gain levels , you'll also gain job levels . so it not only important make sure your characters good level , but also good job level . game looks absolutely stunning , least nintendo ds . it far one best looking out there . there some moments where it looks pixilated , but you can't deny game just looks good regardless . movie sequences also really pretty look they run surprisingly well . battle also fantastic . your enemies sport some amazing detail so backgrounds battle . whole , game just looks good . perhaps only fault graphics how restricted animation characters enemies combat . your characters won't physically go up strike enemy . rather they just step forward swing . very similar how final fantasy games nes worked . it strange see , but you'll quickly get used it . thing seems kind strange , though , top screen throughout most game remains blank . all action takes place bottom screen . there few moments when top screen actually displays anything . you'll see world map you travel overworld while you're towns . there certain moments where top screen text , or shows important story sequence , but that usually it . other than , when trumping through dungeons ( you often ) battle ( you also often ) top screen remains blank . there nothing wrong it , but it feels very awkward play nintendo ds game where top screen blank . they could've used it display dungeon maps or enemy information or something . top screen no impact gameplay whatsoever . music game pretty good , though . it not good other games series , there some tunes just aren't great , but music no means bad . there no voice acting game , really , but we let slide . audio wise , game good . final fantasy iii pretty satisfying experience any final fantasy fan looking good challenge , see how far series come . however , it may also shed little too much its old school charm some areas , particularly its unforgiving challenge . still , it worth it final fantasy fans who want see just how far series come . good+finally chance play final fantasy iii+great visual look+good music+the job system interesting+it provides good challenge+a fair amount secrets sidequeststhe bad-the story not all great-for some game might provide too much challenge , point frustration-high random encounter rate-throughout most your adventure top screen just ... blank ... nintendo ds game this just feels awkwar	1
pros : almost unlimited customization your car(s ) , depth tuning ; great fun play sometimes ( when you actually racing ) , some game effects like weather well ; graphics good , but not nearly good gt4 cons : unrealistic ( but i suppose that not point this game , can't some combine realistic driving engine gran turismo customization game like this - possiblities would amazing ); you drive everywhere . i want f***ing race , not spend five minutes driving performance shop graphics shop before driving five minutes actual race ; progress game you need raise your car rating only way get really high ratings put gawding looking crap your car like spinners , massive hood scoops , huge wings make your car look like its attacked ufo ; please , some us actually taste like our cars look tastefully doneoverall : ok arcadish game anyone who likes drive around not racing putting terribly ugly crap your cars probably lot fun , but i think i'll stick gran turismo series	1
good prices , fast shipping good packaging . can't get much better . thank you	1
they're nice cards , i never problem . since i 3 ps2s my house time , we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine ... then my boyfriend bought me these i always my own memory cards , no one else could say they theirs or anything else . only problem i think they little expensive	1
days where people play games shoot random people other stuff ... it nice know there still art videogames . i loved this game . my brother heard it i rented it soon after . wow ... graphics : 10/10 lovely , lovely , beautiful ! enough saidsound : 20/10 music so pretty . i love orchestral going . story : 7/10 average , " save princess " game ... controls : 8/10 hard deal horse . easy when walkingoverall : 9/10 this beautiful game but it upsetting it so short . i easily say this game introduced me into full-on puzzle games . it something ico but no one really knows if it prequel , sequel or anything ..	1
okay , i'll start saying i don't play many role-playing computer games . i'm fan genre , but i tend play strategy/command-and-conquer style games . so , when i picked this one up , i didn't lot compare my experience . i immediately sucked into game , controls not hard learn , despite what review said . character progression cool , giving fair bit control over how you develop both skillwise alignmentwise ( you want good or evil ? it your choice effects how game plays out ) . optional quests main story quests all cool , but i warn you all : final battle way too easy . i beat whole game without maxing most skills , without most really cool legendary weapons , without doing lot side quests . but you continue game world after it ends : just let credits roll aprox . 10 minutes . though , there no new quests , you run around tie up loose ends , like opening demon doors silver key chests .	1
this fun game . i rarely play games ( last two i really played dungeon keeper final fantasy 7 ) very enjoyable , really not all difficult if you pulse story really cool . my gripes it too easy , evil mode rather boring , you age everyone else not , too short . too short major gripe . only difficult part prison sequence which also best drama story my opinion , i actually got angry then saddend events . they need make sequal which much longer , actually point evil mode gives some simbalance game time character age . buy it anywa	1
this game way more like vice city than san andreas , so anyone expecting see character who eat , go gym etc , disappointed . san andreas revolution history all gaming , this solid game too , but minus revolution . you get all fun vice city basically , which means cop bribing , law breaking , pedestrian harming havoc . sad fact you not climb , swim or fly there no jetpack ! d'oh!the graphics poor storyline not good i would hope but remember this psp port ! it also only 20 bucks , so give it try , if you liked vice city lot , then you like this one	1
ps2 far dead !! square-enix it again !!!! first off , i am going say i love this game !!! i'm big turn-based/stategy rpg fan . but i would say this gamefs battle system semi-real-time strategy elements i love it !! i would compare battle system likes parasite eve vagrant story !! same elements still present original valkyrie profile . this probably best rpg i played all year . i strongly recommend this game any rpg fan definitely satisfy until ffxii !!! now review : graphics : 5 out 0f 5 simply amazing i knew old ps2 still it her . this game some best graphics you going see ps2 , you may see some pixilation but hardly noticeable unless you looking it ... detail characters , background dungeons amazing . i really get taken back vagrant story when i play this game . omg special attacks look absolutely gorgeous !! perform special attack your jaw drop . i canft say anything negative graphics this game what so ever especially last generation . sound : 4.5 out 5 game sounds great !!! voice over well !! battle cries wonderful take you back original valkyrie profile unless course you purchased it psp then it wont take you back very farclol controls 5 out 5 okay i donft thing i played rpg better controls . you play 2d screen side scrolling outward inward exits entrances press up or down accordingly access them . anyone who played first one knows exactly how it works . first new thing you notice new battle control scheme . old you still press , o , , or correspond character you assigned button , still works great !! new now you able roam 3d once you battle mode this works great i explain gameplay section . l2 lets you find switch targets , then you just analog get there . gameplay 5 out 5 dare i say umm perfect !?!?!? first i address two things i loved original valkyrie profile you find this sequel/prequel ! 1st thing - i began get really annoyed rpgfs now days make you talk nearly every single person town move story . this never worry valkyrie profile series . you go town if there something importance there cg or ai takes over all you listen/read then go shopping or if you really want , talk limited amount people town , but it normally just random talk nothing real importance story . or you may talk some people fnd side quest maybe ? many rpgfs i tried play lately suffered thisci mean who time sit play game hours only left feeling like you barely accomplished anything , cause you couldnft find right person move story ? 2nd thing battle system , able press certain button numerous times watch character spring action always joy . lets you feel more involved battle instead just letting you sitting watching . new additions great additionscfirst free roaming battle . you move anywhere 3d battle screen you want within parameters course . since you able move anywhere battle screen square-enix thought it would good idea allow you split up your party , they right !! basically you party 4 ; but you split them up into 2 teams . imagine this if you willcyou send one team either fight separate group enemies or you send one group draw attention use other group attack behind taking enemy surprise normally causing more damage . strategy added !!! other notable mentions : special attacks stellar , enemy bosses huge , characters very likable . also while dungeon you still turn foes crystal use them aide you reaching different areas , but dig this !! now you turn foe crystal then shoot foe second time transport yourself its position . ex . you see enemy ledge front/above you but you cannot reach him or ledge simply jumping . so you shoot diagonally him freeze him shoot second time you immediately transported his position ledge he transported your old position . how cool ? story ( so far ) 4 out 5 , story so far great what i tell takes place before original valkyrie profile , i am only 40% it but so far i am really drawn it , i cant go more detail sake spoiling it , but it intriguing . bottom line : if you rpg fan you must this title your library games , it not disappoint . combination great original gameplay , stellar graphics , intriguing story , innovative new features this one not missed . even if you not rpg fan i would still recommend this rental .	1
this best game made xbox - well worth money	1
though i admit this game title old , not mean product should damaged . 1 discs probably damaged storage game system trouble reading disc . this my second attempt getting game ; first time all discs broken so i returned them . but this time only 1 broken i found out too late . final fantasy viii great game but if only discs not broken .	1
okay , so there tons reviews ffviii intense hatred love both ends spectrum . so , what if your indesicive purchasing this game ? here some simple facts . whether or not you enjoy this game hinge fact you ) like squall leonhart b)enjoy sci-fi based rpg opposed strict high fantasy finally c)have patience understand draw/junction system . i loved this game very much because all three points never issue me . there some weaknesses game but most just come scripting plot . primary one lone wolf introvert leading entire team high spirited extroverts . would drive anyone up wall though . i think many people didn't like squall because they knew someone like him real life . only other real plot weakness major big bad villans ( edea , adel ultimecia ) seem take complete backseat all squall personal problems ( getting know rinoa , learning more his family)i'd rather more balance two plot forces but that i t.t he draw/junction system which powers up pc requires lot more thought than other systems ff used but if you remember what stats used ( like vit defense spr magic defense ) it go lot smoother . if you like rpg like xenosaga , or phantasy star or even knights old republic then all means get this your collection ... just keep mind points i made before	1

" eye toy play2 kix video games . i am parent six year old girl . like many parents , i worried getting video game system my daughter , given prevalent headlines kids not getting enough exercise . then i saw eye toy advertised , i thought it could serve means keep my daugther active , but still allow her participate video game activities which kids love . i bought eye toy play 2 video game , i couldn't happier results . my daughter loves games . they very inventive , if you've seen advertising , you already realize eye toy camera puts player image right middle action . system doesn't work perfectly , but close enough simiulate activities cooking kung fu . game format also allows fun head-to-head competition which great kids parties , etc . best part , my daughter works up real sweat when she plays games . games her jumping , diving , dancing , punching , kicking . she gets great exercise lot more fun than if she just sitting there . games aren't just young kids either . kids up young teen age years seem enjoy them too . matter , i enjoy them , but i'm not worried appearing cool . we also bought my daughter sega superstars disc eye toy . those games geared older children , but there couple which my daughter loves o.o verall , i couldn't happier how this experiment turned out . i really hope more people become aware eye toy benefits , because i think they great solution vexing problem . maybe eye toy should buy old kix gingl e.p.s. one thing eye toy should come lamp . buy one your own ( we use desk lamp flexible neck ) make sure area player very well lit . if not , camera difficult time seeing player , results aren't good .	1
this game what prequels couldn't me ... it drew me back into star wars universe vengence . i am not real big gamer , really don't like console games but this game must any fan , casual or hardcore . knights also comes pc version those who don't access console or like me don't really care them . fact pc version more mods available it i believe so i would probably recommend it first . knights , or kotor it known fan community set 4000 years before new hope . it sweeping tale talented padawan who comes late force holds fate galaxy their hands . since this rpg best part jedi you ! what really drew me this game well developed storyline flushed out characters . other members you party backstorys play directly into plot form sidequests during course game . you almost feel like they real i found myself becoming emotionally attached party memebers story progressed . their responses also influenced your dialog choices , even affect main character relationships other party members . this bioware game well so there option romance one other party members . you also choose which side force follow . player either quintessential light jedi , evil palpatine , or somewhere inbetween . your choices throughout game affect your alignment force also what powers less exhausting use . dialog fantastic rarely comes off cheesy ( unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless ) voice actors who portray other characters wonderful . even dialog main character option funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment . game gives you choice play male or female character which actually influences what side quests you pick up , well minor effect main story . personally i thought this most gratifying aspect game . i got play kickin female jedi who holds fate galaxy her hands . due this well ability choose your alignment there four possible endings this game . knights able hold excellent replay factor well due number mods available game other fans . lucasarts actually encourages even supports fan mad mods thier website . when you get bored main storyline there mods out there change everything looks clothes force powers even dialog . there even mod out there restores cut fifth ending only available female character . game mechanics pretty easy get handle . combat options give you ability either choose what attacks each character your party use or leave them automated . those who aren't real familiar computer games should able pick up basics fairly fast . those who like first person shooters may find it little frustrating attacks themselves automated . me this plus i'm not fan " button smashers . " work advice someone who hasn't played game or isn't familiar it storyline , avoid searching internet info it much possible . this may frustrating if you someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me , storyline twist not something you want spoil . you'll enjoy game storyline much more if you don't spoil surprise . there gaming sites where you get cheats only cheats if your cheater like me . not only teen players enjoy it but i know plenty 20 30 somethings who adore this game . it great job capturing feel original trilogy . if you like star wars all , run ... don't walk buy this game	1
there three things matter me when i sit down play game . ( 1 ) playability , ( 2 ) story , ( 3 ) graphics . this game excelled all three . ease directing my character choosing his moves so prominent felt so natural i just sort fell into my character role . few other rpg games , i didn't doubt second what i supposed move forward . story game deep riveting - but more importantly , sensible . this not just action game annoying , throw-away characters subplots go nowhere . you actually care characters involved you take keen interest what their future holds , even characters you only get see moment . ending especially well , it left me thinking where my character would go next , what he would , what path he would follow . even though i made his decisions throughout entire game , he still his own character - i simply shaped him bit . when i finally put controller down watched credits roll up screen , i heartbroken it over . but then i realized i could simply start all over again completely different character , end up completely different place . whole new experience . if you're anything like me , trust me when i say this game one kind . last , but certainly not least , graphics fantastic times breath-taking . graphics only work bring out story characters make universe game set all more believable . they never fail set tone whatever setting you find yourself . its predecessor , sith lords raised bar role-playing games . role-playing games , such final fantasy , while still enjoyable their own right , tend allow player almost no freedom all . sith lords allows astounding amount freedom . you literally go where you want , you what you want , however you want it . granted , it not grand theft auto , but then , gta not role-playing game . but while i am quick point out great aspects game , i most also point out bad . first major annoyance game continually froze i forced reset system start over . counter this problem , you'll forced save often different slots - game even warns you so . it not really big deal , but it get me little . second major annoyance my inability control all members my party proficiently - ai continally got me into trouble i could avoided . ( this one problems first knights old republic . ) other than , there nothing else worth mentioning . its predecessor , i hold this game highest esteem , eagerly look foward next ( if there one ) installment . enjoy game	1
let me say yes , this game too violent kids but beyond , it totally awesome ! graphics better than those found san andreas i enjoy robbing stores greatly ! you also notice your health armor decline more rapidly this game than sa . ok , so it not three super detailed cities but it one nearly perfect city ... vice city perfect parody 1980s miami missions seem pretty reflective . storyline what you would expect but voice over acting exceptional videogame . two main characters , tommy lance , sound better than characters most major motion pictures . i started my adventures gta san andreas but fact , i am enjoying this game even more ! anyone who liked either gta iii or san andreas , pick this up way , avoid lib city stories , it just too dull after while	1
i loved this game . it well made insanely broad what you could it . if you aren't phased fantasy violence then you'll probably think game lot fun too . but i never let my children come within 10 feet this game you probably shouldnt either . here why . i fitting retitle this game would " scarface : game " because that what great deal this game modeled after , extremely violent movie drug lord . game takes place realistic coastal city . there restaurants , beaches , hospitals , hotels , police depts , grocery stores , bars , gas stations . fact game modeled after locations sights found movie scarface . city populated pedestrians , golfers , shoppers , people waiting get buses/in cabs , hookers , gang members , strippers , drug dealers , policemen , emergency medical technicians , bums , store cashiers , etc . you kill any one these people . you solicit prostitute , then run over her your car she gets out leaves , then take money back you paid her . you watch strip show then shoot stripper . you hack pedestrian up chainsaw . throw cab driver out his cab then run him over it . you perform drive-by shootings . you start gang war . you walk up car , aim rifle innocent driver shoot them directly head watch them fall out driver seat . you drive around inside shopping center run over shoppers . you distribute flyers adult films you're producing . you even start massacre shooting then emt come help people , blow them up rocket launcher , or simply beat them death baseball bat . you become such threat city national guard may appear tanks , helicopters , infantry . yes you kill them too . you don't all this stuff . fact almost none it necessary completing main point game . you simply freedom it if you desire o.o you could simply go through basic missions game involve ex-con rise power leader powerful mafia-type drug cartel la , you guessed it , scarface . your kid probably love it . all all , what it , it extremely well made . course if you worried violence etc found video games could negatively affect your child , then you should no means let them anywhere near it	1
this one best shooter games ever . but $60 it okay maybe worth $40 but still great game overall . it comes free gun which really cool but , really fragile hope this helps	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1
i little late booming cult following phoenix wright acquired , just bought game this month . however , it not dissapoint . i always fan point click adventures pc but dissapointed trace memory , not so much it bad game but it soo short . i hesitant spend money again game i could beat 10 hours time , but luckily i . phoenix wright one those games enough challenge it you don't feel like you breezing effortlessly through it , yet open enough younger players able play enjoy it well . length game fairly long , five cases solve , each one becoming longer more difficult you play . i must say you really get into characters this game each case connected some way others , i really liked last case added use luminol finger printing tools ( makes you feel all csi , stuff ;) ) . i look forward second one coming out soon , definately recommend this one best ds right now	1
this game lot fun . start end you sucked into this game not able put it down . interviewing witness , finding clues , cross examinations court . there lot it fun invigorating . buying this game not leave you dissapointed , only wishing more	1

ddr extreme 2 very fun game . i just bought it yesterday i am already used it . it very easy catch . you simply press arrows dance mat when they reach arrows top screen . free play , levels -(from easiest hardest ) beginner , light , standard , heavy . i , after day use , am already working some songs light level . higher level , faster more complicated footwork . some my favorite songs butterfly upswing , my my my , boom boom dollar , captain jack , get busy . if you two dance mats you connect them compete against friend , or even harder yet , dance yourself using two mats . i highly recommend dance dance revolution extreme 2 anyone who would like some highly addictive fun , while getting into shape !!!	1
i very much enjoyed this game i think it may my favorite x-box game i own ! i kinda agree person said this game pretty short , but it not make it any less better ! one funny part this game part where you sunny first time game jump each pipe whole time she just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game people like games fun , educational , very durable	1
anyone witha ps2 one . it simple . it not exactly great because because it annoying first place feature memory wasnt ps2 first place	1
" i've played half-life 2 , " " battlefield 2 , " this more enjoyable what it ... now multiplayer , bf2 better far too . detailed graphics , hl 2 better . but , single player experience open ended routes your objectives , good graphics , engaging ai , huge open environments , different types opponents , guns , maps , so , this great game ! i replayed whole thing once many levels many many times . i would recommend this over any other first-person shooter i've played . multiplayer , bf2 , cs , or desert combat ( which i think i liked best maybe those ) ... but stand-alone : far cry . i hope crytek hurries up makes some new pc game their engine , which blows bf2 out water ... someone should ... even though bf2 great game .	1
title doesn't imply anything negative , i just really liked morrowind exotic cities cultural clashes . this game makes you move your virtual life morrowind imperial province which more similar earthly historical place . now sentimental stuff out way good stuff . graphics much , much better than morrowind . my system isn't over recommended settings but i still play smoothly choosing my settings correctly it looks very good . models much more detailed effect you'll sometimes even gasp when you run into attractive female who got her clothes stolen . sound just good morrowind main theme tribute morrowind main theme . there lot voices this game it possible not read any conversions just listen npcs . you thankfully skip over lines you don't want hear if you fast reader . just like morrowind you also add new songs music folder if you want use custom soundtrack . control improved . blocking so much better even if you aren't warrior you hold your own melee against common enemies . new magic casting take some getting used so unified menus . controls feel more like console game oblivion battles lot more action based than morrowind . gameplay , most changes better . cities improved seemingly using gothic 2 like model . it seems me they also took hunting " radiant ai " playing game . it fits tes very nicely . enemies level up now so leveling up wrong skills may get you into trouble higher levels but so far it hasn't bothered me . trading different i'm not sure it improved much . lockpicking gives you option minigame but you also it morrowind way . speechcraft thankfully much more improved . stealing also more elaborate . steal store hang around guards come looking you even if nobody actually saw you stealing . missions now more elaborate even most trivial ones may surprise you some funny , emotional even sensual topics . travel different no more stilt riders , boats or guild guides . now you horse option ( they actually fight too ! ) fast travel option places you've before or major sites you haven't yet . but end this still tes . all you're old morrowind tricks like repairing bound armor , shooting arrows while levitating , beating people pulp your bare hands gaining magicka fighting your own creatures still possible . personal note i'm glad atronach birthsign now gives you 50% spell absortion stunted magicka . if you liked morrowind you'll most likely like this one well . players who put off morrowind low level combat should try oblivion . players who traditionally don ' like deep rpgs should give it chance . like hack slash games ? create stereotypical warrior join fighters guild . like stealth games ? create stereotypical thief join thieves guild . you may just like it enough try out new things	1
my son told me this game after he got his xbox 360 . i said sure , it your birthday happy birthday i got him game . wow ! i watched him play game it fun just watch him play . i went bought my own copy my pc i am totally hooked ! great game play rpg fps !! best both worlds ! it completely immersing sucks you get-go ! one great features you change you character before leaving sewers . i am currenly playing khajit dark elf ( stealth vs fighter/mage ) seeing how each affects game play . it really make difference . i totally recommend this game !! i loved it so much i went bought es iii morrowind goty tribunal bloodmoon ! highly recommended ! how much more i say ? great quests , plotlines ; it make difference which quest you first ( dont worry , it doesnt kill game play ) what you get . i am already arena grand champion i made killing going " laura croft " all over place !! note : if you get this game , yourself favor get addons ; it makes great game fantastic ! one final note : i p4 3ghz 2gb memory w/nvidia 6200oc 256 it plays game great . i run game 800x600 graphics fantastic	1
microsoft created extraordinary machine . crisp graphics so far library games available impressive . only problem i microsoft produced defective product . first few months it played fine only aa couple moments where games would freeze . no biggie . then it died . no problem , sent it repairs under warranty . free charge . cool . got it back it played well me actually beating ghost recon no problems . i stopped playing while but when i tried playing again bam ! ring death . warranty over . $130-140 dollars fix . yay . i think i'm going throw it against wall buy new one . hopefully microsoft found all solutions defects .	1
i got this my son christmas . we all played enjoyed it . my son just loves it .	1
those looking fast paced side scrolling shooter not disappointed . those who value their free-time away video games should look elsewhere . r-type final offers rewarding shooter experience provided you challenge it " human " ( normal ) difficulty or higher . it hardly worth playing lower settings due lack any real challenge . this game offers 101 different ships you play . unlocking them both rewarding aggrivating . everytime you unlock high powered ship , you'll enjoy exploring its capabilities battle . however , novelty only lasts one play-through most . other hand , flight time you log particular ship unlock new ones truly absurd . sometimes you log over two full hours flight time ship unlock new one . battle mode interesting challenging its own way , though i honestly would preferred inclusion two-player mode . while r-type final no means perfect , it rewarding experience those looking relieve heyday side scrolling shooters . just anticipate loosing many , many hours your life unlocking new ships	1
challenging game hundred ships , several hidden bonus levels , several endings , several levels difficulty , new versus mode , great gameplay , excellent graphics , decent soundtrack . this one worthy sequel r-type delta ps1 , it also holds its own against square classic einhander	1
cooking mama esentially series cooking mini-games strung together form ' recipes ' dishes . it enjoyable game but it lacks enough depth truely replayable . when enjoyed casually i think this game could last while , but aside these dishes there little else . i found myself wanting unlock more than recipes , find new ways using my cooking practice . one way this game could easily made classic would add some competitive play it . how iron chef matches or wi-fi tournaments ? but there not much this game once novelty wears off , which me 6 hours later . i've come back it casually but not more than few minutes here there . it , however , well worth $20 price tag	1
i've pretty much partial playstation controllers since i got my ps1 back 1997 . when i saw nintendo 64 controller , i nearly puked . joystick middle didn't make any sense me . i looked gamecube controller , wasn't exactly impressed . it looked kinda goofy-asymmetric , maybe . well , when i finally picked one up , i found it fit my hands much better than ps models . this would my favorite controller if nintendo changed few things . 1 . button too hard me reach . 2 . joystick pad awkward positions . fortunately most games don't really force you use these much , but if you're going put buttons controller , make them all easily accessible . due these flaws , i can't really say it better than playstation design . they're probalby tied	1
this controller great . nice feel all . but , it tend move one side its own . many people think it controller , but if you read manual , it clearly states when gamecube turned joystick one side , base controller . this fixed simultaneously holding y+x+start . great controller , easy 5 stars !	1
roughly 30 bones this product really good . my only gripe button text wears off . other than it absolutely great especially if 360 center your entertainment	1
i more than 500 albums my music collection , including more than 650 artists . while this not largest collection -my friends even much larger ones- i find it extremely uncomfortable locate specific artist or album using regular game controller . even while using limited edition media controller you would spend lot time locating specific media . that why i find extremely useful alphanumerical keypad included this control , it also useful when changing tv channels . price not high , it well designed . highly recommended mcx users	1
i grew up nes snes , so seeing these games new graphics some bonus features very nice surprise me . i just much fun playing through this game i playing ffii snes . fortunately there some improvements made dialogue , which made it much easier follow characters little deeper . square added some items extra equipment . also , you option switch all characters towards end game , which gives game new flavor . there some small bugs it , but most don't hurt gameplay too much . only downfall this remake they took away weapon-doubling cheat ... :-( thus , no more stacks 99 excallibur swords edge throw ..	1
i like it so far , i think new features going cool once i get better them . i just don't like they made precision passing more complicated , they changed kicking , but i think i figured out . i beat computer 52 points , so i guess i am doing okay ( never mind i playing texans , ha ha ) . i haven't really used precision passing though ... just gotten lucky my passing most part . i liked it it me ' 06	1
i am scratching my head why everyone thinks gun such terrible game . i bought it few weeks ago reduced price , i really enjoy game . graphics quite nice , voice acting really good , gameplay itself entertaining . i really enjoy open western environment game . basically , gun structured like grand theft auto game once you pass first few missions , you find yourself open environment you free explore , take up side missions , or start actual missions game . some side missions include ranching , participating pony express , working bounty hunter arresting or killing fugitives , playing texas hold'em saloon , hunting wild game . completing these missions improve your characters ' abilities , such they tie overall picture . gun features quickdraw mode fire , which essentially same feature used max payne which slows down gameplay allows you make precise targeted shots . feature i like gun fact your character able buy weapons items , such weapon upgrades , improve his overall strength . you earn money through completing missions side missions , mining gold , winning gambling . many people complain gun too short overall story not very in-depth . while there some truth this , you should not pass up your chance play gun now it reduced $20 . fact , this game actually steal $20 . it much better game than people give it credit .	1

wow , i don't know why i didn't buy one sooner . xbox live far best feature . gears war oblivion amazing . i don't high-def tv still surprised how good graphics . if you want online gaming powerhouse , get this . ps3 blue-ray player tempting , but 600 its not worth it . plus it really weak launch titles	1
we love katamari not wonderful music first game , but levels improved astronomically ! this game plays just like first , but there even more things find more creativity gameplay . every level one present find one four cousins capture each . we love katamari definitely makes katamari damacy seem repetitious . how this so ? well , mindless rolling no longer get you best score . example , one level you make katamari big you only 50 objects ( which quite difficult task such large area ) . level requires some serious searching money level . this level , you pick up things make more money , not increase size katamari meters . finding expensive jewelry early other pricy objects key making ton cash . there many other interesting levels this game , but i think it'd best leave them surprise . regarding complaints short length game , this far truth . game easier beat than first , but it still just hard make gigantic planets . i've spent hours trying my very best each level . i never got bored since most levels very unique . i highly recommend this game anyone any age . my five-year-old nieces nephews could not stop playing this game when they came over	1
this microphone so comfortable , i forget i it sometimes . i mistakenly wear it even if i'm not playing online game . if over head type microphones bother you alot , then you want this microphone . it also good people glasses it won't knock them out place . i wear glasses regular xbox live mic always messed my glasses up . halo 2 headset , it not bother my glasses all . consider this microphone if you bothered regular xbox live headset	1
this fun game if your inti mechs graphics good but like first halo game type difficulty level weak easy kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs then varients those ones just differnet weapons loadout multiplayer good but not great	1
doom 3 scary . you literally spend most game dark nightmarish creatures come out nowhere try kill you . environments look great so character models . game long but longer if you get lost . however , this game few flaws . one ( it big one ) you always carry flashlight around . because most fps only character one weapon one hand time other hand non-existent , you constently switch flashlight weapon . so when it dark you fight , you either hold flashlight keep whacking your opponent until it dead or stay dark shoot your enemy which you hard time finding it . second con ( unlike half life 2 ) you can't really interact much . you can't grab certain objects drop them or throw them . final con , which comes one word : imps . these most annoying enemy game . you constently fight them it get annoying sometimes . otherwise , game get	1

i so excited over this package . 4 games one all them got pretty good reviews online so i checked it out . awesome !! this package definatly worth money . black white very unique game ive spent hours playing . freedom fighters amazing . i loved squad aspects action . lotr very cool but i some framerate problems even tho my comp exceeds recommended requirements . only reason i gave this package 4 because medal honor doesnt work my computer tech support not help all . i've heard good things moh so if it happens work your computer then just makes this deal even better . this great package i recommend it all . i got all cd keys all games so other reviewer who not must just unlucky . :	1
no , it not joke . this first expansion pack i've bought sims 2 , my first thought i trying find all new stuff it adds . it add some nice things , mostly couches , chairs , art , tables , beds clothes . some new colors shag carpeting which awesome . i also like new dresses , dressers . original sims 2 just offers those space guzzling amoires . addition you'll see you now influence people thingsit made my game immediately run slower then before , but i'm sure it nothing cleaning my hard drive won't cure . other reivewers suggested it nice pack , but overpriced right now	1
this game long time making , given cultural popularity western genre , it surprising western-themed video game should take so long come market . i this game long time , but only recently got play it , when i finally got into it , it enormously entertaining i loved lot spaghetti-western themed humor musical score . game , you control variety characters ( many whom introduced superb opening sequence , which plays much like opening credits sergio leone western ) . most time , you play part red harlow , half-breed bounty hunter mission hunt down his parents ' murderers . ( sound familiar ? ) you'll also get chance control variety other western archetypes , such expert pistoleer english dandy , sharpshooting , spitfire rancher daughter , indian cousin red harlow ( who dresses like iroquois instead sioux or other plains indian - but i'm nitpicking ) , negro buffalo soldier , you even get play bad guy when you assume role renegade mexican general . gameplay itself took little time get used . instance , draw your gun , you must press button down , keep it held down while pressing button shoot . if you let go button which draws your gun , your character holster his gun again . this one quirks which made initially difficult learning curve . however , once controls mastered , combat actually surprisingly easy . you duck , hide behond cover , dive/roll , jump . when guns holstered , you even punch kick - one my favorite sequences whole game bar brawl ( more stereotypical western scenes ! ) where you cannot use your guns , but must use fists feet ( occassionally broken whiskey bottles ) fight your way safety . addition " normal " combat , there " showdown " mode which dedicated quick-drawing against one or more opponents . highlight this feature " tournament " ( which seems inspired movie " quick dead " ) where you battle ever-faster enemies until you win . this mode sometimes very frustrating you may replay again again . overall , graphics okay - what helps make this title fact makers put grainy , old-style matinee look ( like game movie played old-style ( worn out ) projector , complete hairlines picture moving off-center times . this little touch very endearing . while this title may not lot replay value , it still immensely fun i would recommend it highly .	1
this pretty decent looking diablo-style rpg game adds chapter game sacred . underworld , you explore more areas farther north world ancaria . i found new levels not super great fun explore , rather difficult little confusing , but there interesting new quests , original game world nicely expanded played 2 new characters , dwarf demoness . original sacred game known lot small bugs glitches , which many eliminated or minimized thanks underworld epansion pack	1
all right , i'm quite sick seeing people hate this game . i am addicted black white 2 . soon you get past whole tutorial business , it free-for-all . there couple problems . first , this game not run any old machine . it better fast good video card supports pixel shading . sound good . after installation issues , you get game . when you first play game , tutorials extremely helpful . i first played game laptop , stupid camera rotating sounded , i actually needed know how change view my fingerpad-mouse laptop . learning completely how interact world without refer manual i think really good . when you replay game , tutorials seem redundant , but anyone remember tutorials give you tribute order buy advances your civilization ? now when you're trying aquire 1,000,000 tribute get volcano miracle , every little tribute counts . so bare through tutorials again quit whining . if you type person likes simulations ( any maxis sim games , any civilization series , example ) , this game highly addictive . i personally don't enjoy gore violence every five seconds appreciate building civilization part . you truly get control how game goes . plus , after you win land , you stay there long you like grow metropolis until entire island covered your houses buildings . it obviously not casual gamer type thing . beating game challenge , it should , but same time it intriguing fun . i just sick seeing people give it such bad reviews . leave black white 2 alone ! just because you aren't competent enough complete this game or need shoot something every five seconds doesn't mean this game bad	1
well , i must say after purchasing linksys wga11b wireless-b game adapter while yes this adapter overpriced , it work considering i only got linksys adapter work once then it shut down middle update i must say price looked worth it . i can't vouch your financial situations but after speading nearly 3 days trying set up linksys when my wife finally said i should get this instead - this hooked up connected instantly . no problems i guess price it look nice hooked back xbox . so you may not many problems i linksys but if you any questions or limited computer/networking ability this " worth " price ( only because nothing simplier exist ) . so i would recommend this product if you want true plug-and-play which i don't believe linksys . i'm sure plently people happy linksys , it just didn't work me . so think first avoid paying both . i would go back never buy linksys if i could	1
i bought paper mario 2 my neice play when she comes over visit , now she comes over play game . it interesting story line many characters interact . puzzles only moderatly hard so she hasn't gotten stuck lost interest , but story long enough we haven't just breezed through it either . it better if you take so side trips work " missions " fight arena ( where you build up your levels faster ) . you also revisit previous lands re-fight random encounters . only drawback game play long cut screens you read . game flow would better if there option read these you , like super monkey ball 2 . i know , i know , educational aspect reading yourself , but that her parents job , not mine :) game masters find this way too easy but if you just want entertainment without getting stuck long periods time puzzles then parper mario 2 work you . well worth $20 pric	1
aside instant impression may put reader this review i'm reviewing this game only because it multiplayer , singleplayer actually what i look game . multiplayer just extra me , however , halo ported pc online multiplayer front mind ( halo xbox originally intended xbox live multiplayer abilities , but this feature never made it into game ) . halo amazing singleplayer campaign remains untouched ( which good thing ) . if you new halo craze , story takes place humanity alliance alien races known covenant . after narrow escape enemy fleet , usnc ( human alliance ) ship named piller autumn finds itself strange ring world covenant call halo . when ship boarded covenant forces , escape pods launched ships surviving crew find themselves halo , attempting learn it uncover it dark secrets while franticly fighting through armies covenant all while . you play spartan 117 , known simpily master chief . you breed super soldier , created turn tide losing battle against covenant . stronger , taller better equiped than average marines , you savior battlefield . game 10 massive levels , many vehicles easy fun use , while same time , not forcing you use them . you jump out vehicles . you pick up any weapon lying around , it human or covenant . however , you only carry 2 weapons time ( not counting grenades ) . you encounter few different species enemy troops way , such ... grunts- chunky little guys who don't much damage , even if they're groups . they however use plasma grenades , which kill you 100% if it sticks you . if their forces thinned or if stronger unit leading them into battle killed , they usually panic which sends them running around screaming . elites- backbone covenant forces , elites carry plasma rifles ( higher ranking elites carry energy swords ) deal out powerful melee attack . they also use energy shield similar yours , making them equally difficult kill . they usually work pairs or larger groups often seen leading teams grunts into battlejackels- these back-line troops . they hide behind hand-held energy shields fire plasma pistols you . they dangerous groups , but they tend shoot you while you're fighting other enemies , their shields difficult take down . hunters- these huge enemies extreamly powerful fule-rod cannon ( only weapon you can't pick up ) mounted their arm dish out melee attack sends marines flying . their armor impossible penetrate , so you'll shoot them their small exposed areas armor plates . they always deployed pairs well . you also encouunter race alien spices later game even covenant fear . graphics now better than xbox version ( provided your computer run it maximum quality ) . if anything , i just miss xbox controler ... which why i like xbox version halo better than pc version . , halo still everything xbox version only online multiplayer battles . thanks people who play halo multiplayer , however , it not very enjoyable . i don't know what it halo causes it online community mainly populated 10 year olds who never learned how not swear all caps every time someone kills them . that not worst it though ... teamkillers . halo multiplayer completly infested them . every time you turn around team oriented battle , teammate shooting you face . if you're headed vehicle , you should lookout teammate who doesn't think you worthy using it ... all time . if it wasn't this , it would great multiplayer game . problem they didn't add campaign 2 player o-o , which practicly best part halo ( xbox) ! so , your reasons get this ) you don't xbox but want play halo without spend extra $150b ) you prefer pc fps games consolec ) you want good multiplayer , but aren't bothered bad communityd ) you can't stand play game unless it best possible graphical qualityoverall , halo hands down best game i every experianced ( i huge fan when it first came out xbox ) . though i still prefer xbox version , pc still great . compared call duty , however , multiplayer fallsa little short , mainly because people who infest it online servers .	1
this game amazing . unlike so many other star wars games , this first person shooter , which great touch star wars universe . i found gameplay very well healing stations battlefield your squad always you revive you if you fall battle . coolest thing all instead carrying multiple weapons , you attachments one gun . attachments sniper , rocket launcher . single player campaign outstanding , though multiplayer so-so . this game simply terrific star wars title	1
we just got ps2 after no game system all since old atari i when i 13 . so learning all quot ; new fangledquot ; controls bit tricky . starsky hutch , well fun game , straight-forward enough learning curve easy enabled me get right into action without die thousand times just learn how maneouvre . i get better controller , game still proving fun challenging without frustrating	1
i really enjoyed this game . yes , it not perfect , but it definitely worth price game . if you're looking escape back old west , then this your game . many reviewers mentioned , there some flaws game - if you get past them , then i am positive you enjoy game . horse riding fun , but i also found myself enjoying plot - it plays like movie . cut scenes great fun watch well ( voice ) acted . graphics detailed well . i found artists took their time modeling weaponry era it likely very historically accurate ( big plus ) . if you ever wanted " star " western , this your chance . if you like tv shows movies such gunsmoke , deadwood , once upon time west you'll probably wonder where this game ... i .	1
i may not typical game player 36-year-old woman , but i love driving games , this one best driving games ever pc . there something little crazy enjoying speeding through miami streets , running over pedestrians , taking missions hit(wo)man , eluding law . game definitely stirred up lot controversy , but it just game ... adult game ! i loved whole ' 80s miami vice theme , one most enjoyable parts game speeding around town listening awesome radio stations car . you also create your own radio station your mp3s . graphics downtown cars great , but characters little stiff times . however , this not detract considerably fun factor . some missions too difficult , trying get through them over over again became so tedious i find some cheats online . more liberal save feature would nice . result some missions , i still haven't finished game , but perhaps that beauty gta vice city ... it huge you get your money worth . there nothing i hate more than buying game finding it so simple i finish it couple days ... there no risk this game .	1
this very awesome controller . it looks great its wireless ! i not any problems . i lay my couch 10 feet away play without worry accidently unplugging controller because cord too short . this controller way better than wired controller it comes . i recommend this controller anyone who owns gamecube . i bought it gamestop 17 dollars used ! great deal . buy it now	1
this ultimate mario game , super addicting , you want play this days end ( beware !!! ) , i managed beat game month , but i still unlock paths you always reset it start over , my daughter play it-she 4-tells you how easy it , but don't let fool you , it tough game further you get . only negative point i say when you get final battle , it little disappointing , it only took me 10 tries before i won , either i am natural winning quickly ( doubt it ) , or they made it too easy win , regardless , stop reading this review buy it , you thank me it	1
grand theft auto now 3rd person perspective ! no more overhead camera . well , least it not only mode view . itself makes this game great . you're escaped convict that trying establish name himself make some money completing missions . cities virtually yours . vast , easy explore , no limitations . you jump hijack any car , beat poor old lady baseball bat , even steal police cars . but don't go too trigger-happy , or else feds all over you . you take various missions upon completing them you receive credits advance onto more interesting complicated ones . gta3 great fun play . good graphics , lot missions complete , very many cars weapons	1
castlevania curse darkness true gem , among xbox games . i think , it more designed bridge game that coming out future , two player ( probably xbox360 or play station 3 ) . so they get you ( gamers ) used someone other trevor belmont . one dracula not dead . he get reborn , he needs one devil forger masters get reborn . so its either hector or isaac who die bring forth dracula . so since your hector leaves only isaac who becomes dracula . ( dracula mad hector running off during big battle , thus blaming him his down fall trevor belmont . ) but here only point whole game gets me hector way up army evil he change heart just because dracula wants kill every human who wants them destroyed . part brothers me but who cares its fun game anyway hacking slashing all creatures dark . so its like complexed stories line . but way you don't know what what . it come you movies not all what you see what . like beginning you meet zead saint germain . now zead wants help you your quest saint germain wants try stop you . they both hate each other , zead seems so nice germain like total pain . why not any help helps you average death your wife town people who bur her witch sounds good . you fight saint germain latter , tell you truth he hard , he pulls out gun try shoot you , when he near death . latter you find out zead death " grimm reaper " ., after you fight isaac zead takes isaac turns him into lord dracula , final fight . when you beat dracula you seen ending . now everyone says this game short . when actual its two games you play trevor belmont its totally different then playing hector , game play concern more classical castlevania nes snes days . so if you don't like devils want more classical game try beating it once play trevor . but you also find out ending saint germain there finial battle ( hint game castlevania works ) . so honestly game play cool , battles fun if you play long enough you truly enjoy this game its plot twists . it took me 30 hours beat it , hector i'm finish play it trevor belmont , but say its good . i cant campare this play station games my last castlevania castlevania snes . it reminds me lot game stages , but these more detail more fun 3d . one more then there love stories end , yes i know not what you where expecting , hector julia laforeze . doesn't it melt your heart . yes isaac sister hero . how ironic . there hidden stages more bosses after you beat it its truly gem among xbox games . some mad cause i wrote this but cheesy plot line dracula death fighting so long beat this game figure ill just go ahead tell it . its great game	1
we rented this game out before we purchased it we really like it . we went see movie our almost 4 year old son loved shark tale , so we thought we'd give xbox game try happy we . its really great game . controls pretty simple our son play game , he needs help game , but overall he enjoys it ! my husband i both like playing this game well . its fun , pretty great graphics , great music background , good game play . its not hard kids , but not easy adults either , so you don't get bored this game . we have'nt played very far into game yet , but so far its big hit our house	1
half-life 2 xbox here , somehow , valve managed squeeze every little ounce gameplay appeared last year hit pc game ... barely . let get this out way now : half-life 2 xbox , terms content , exactly same pc version single-player game , so if you played it pc , there nothing new you here . note we say single-player game , because xbox version lacks counter-strike : source , latest version hugely popular online action game came half-life 2 pc . so , when you get down it , half-life 2 xbox basically just acclaimed single-player campaign half-life 2 . that why half-life 2 xbox comes off bit underwhelming . yes , it fairly solid translation one better first-person shooters recent years , but it also lacks extensive multiplayer mod-making features its pc cousin . half-life 2 , you once again assume role gordon freeman , theoretical physicist dimension-hopping commando who saved world alien invasion end half-life . or he ? half-life 2 starts you off facing infamous g-man , mysterious blue-suited character original . end half-life , g-man offered you choice : work him or die . since there would no sequel if you chose latter , half-life 2 assumes you chose former , so you start game train entering city 17 your introduction into this new world . city 17 run-down urban center that equivalent warsaw ghettos during world war ii ; instead jews rounded up live city 17 , it all remnants defeated humanity . half-life 2 takes place untold number years after black mesa incident , but it clear much changed . mysterious enemy known combine conquered planet installed human puppet government carry out its rule . black-clad security forces patrol streets , while propaganda blares endlessly omnipresent video screens . if there one thing valve extremely well , it capturing sense atmosphere , this vision dystopian police state chillingly effective . but you won't spend lot time soaking scene before you're thrust into struggle defeat combine free humanity . you'll your own during most game , but there levels which you'll opportunity fight alongside allies , both alien human . some best team moments come later , when you're battling combine streets buildings city 17 , large-scale battles going groups humans combine huge , spiderlike striders . you never really develop any attachment your teammates , though , they tend very disposable , replacements available regular intervals . teammates tendency get your way cramped interiors . even though they'll slowly move out your way , it still little annoying . addition taking teammates , you'll occasionally opportunity set up sentry guns assist you defense . toughest sequence we encountered involved setting up handful sentry guns defensive alignment , then holding out against waves incoming combine soldiers . surprise somewhat disappointing performance artificial intelligence . most humanoid enemies don't seem show same kind intelligent behavior they original , even tougher difficulty levels . they'll seek cover then peek out fire , but invariably they'll charge you , which makes it easy take them down . maybe it due some weapons bit overpowered , but most opponents don't present much challenge all -- few rounds usually enough stop them . there few fearsome foes , like larger ant lions , which tirelessly pursue you while you frantically unload every bullet you them . then there strider , 50-foo t-t all , walking , organic tank fires devastating bursts spear you one its legs if you get too close . but most part , half-life 2 surprisingly easy , even tougher difficulty levels . case point end game , which feels anticlimactic : you're given horrendously overpowered weapon use against relatively weak opposition . when you get down it , half-life 2 xbox excellent single-player game . if you didn't get chance play pc version , then you owe it yourself check out game xbox ( even though it not smooth sharp what you'll find pc ) . you'll find few games match half-life 2 quality terms immersion gameplay . all these months after its original release , it still excellent first-person shooter should experienced most every action fan . just don't expect anything more after game ends .	1
i played every fps comes out xbox . course i like halo , doom 3 , but love playing anything conflict makes i.e desert storm i ii , vietnam , global terror rainbow 6 series , since i'm army . half-life 2 far best game i played . i thought i wouldn't like it because it no map option or hints objectives , but all you time imagination you spending hours end playing this game . i bought it $15.00 game stop , but if i spent $49.99 i would not disappointed one bit . i not beat this game but put over 512 ( over 8 hours ) minutes into it . this definitely worth buying used or new , if you time you get your $$ worth out this game ! c-murde	1
although this doesn't follow original book , it combination several stories , it holds 1930 flavor . design scenes appealing there enough puzzles throughout story . i don't know if this all dvds , but this one i keep mouse pointer half-inch or so front car order move it which sometimes proved bit annoying . playing it twice , now , i've discovered you solve clues different order still come same conclusion . nice	1

pros : 1 . character creation fun , detailed basically unmatched any game market , much better than nwn creation system . 2 . graphic beautiful , but if you expecting fully 3d environment , you disappointed . 3 . music just awesome . 4 . i mention character creation fun ! playing your custom made party very satisfying experience . any kind team playable , you solo game too if you like . cons : 1 . not feature 3d environment like nwn2 . gameplay linear , but i didn't care point my game develope my character	1
i really enjoy this game , i think they could better , some driving chases just seem bit silly . i enjoy more tactical work he required . however , i ran into glitch i went online found there others who same problem where you get totally stuck cannot move forward all . i played 2 nights row thinking i something wrong before i looked up walkthrough online found out it just glitch game . one i followed instuctions , i finally able move so watch out . it right after you go up watch tower sniper rifle , then enter wharehouse protect madsen which soon you enter there should lot men coming , my problem only 1 guy or other people say no men all , if happens then you hit glitch because lot men should come rushing . instructions i followed follows : turn your ps2 turned off game memory card , then load game ( it should 4:28 . if its not , see note below ) . when cut scene jack tony begins remove memory card " warning , memory card removed use save game option manually save progress re-enable autosave ? " press ok re-insert memory card , then watch cut scene . " previously 24 " dialog box appear , press . then play game usual . if correctly , many men enter . after you complete mission , make sure you save it . note : if your memory card 4:41 . go restart mission save during cut scene . you overwrite 4:41 back 4:28 . it helped me if it happens you , believe me , you glad you read this because i sure .	1

basketball aspect this game little more fun than nba live 2006 just because refs not constantly interupt gmaeplay . but graphic-wise , this game worst graphics than any other sprts game since 2003 , i'm talking ps2 version . but close-up graphics very good . my faveorite part game you even fantasy draft play now mode . but if you basketball fan you really should get this , it extremely fun	1
(...) this 2nd game i purchased my macs , it only one i still play . it really good . story original well executed , voice actors excellent , gameplay fun . graphics may not state art these days , but they subtle more believable when compared many today games which rely overmuch special lighting effects . some puzzles frustrating but once learned you find they really quite easy . jumping puzzles chasms result deadly falls , but hey , who said galaxy safe place ? hone your force jumping skills . your other force powers . you'll need them . cinematics well really carry story forward they segue you into next level . john williams score used effectively . if you like immersed star wars universe , this game you . game based quake 3 arena engine , so it plays really smoothly any new hardware . even older ibooks like g3 i perform well enough play jedi outcast . my powerbook , game flies . multiplayer game good , standards capture flag other team play , but it really shines jedi duel , where fights one one , winner remaining fight next player server . this pure star wars light saber dueling it takes skill finesse good duelist ( if one doesn't use cheats , ) . i wish lucasarts would release more games like jedi knight ii : jedi outcast . jedi academy good , but more like expansion jedi outcast . jedi academy pick up end though , dark side ending leaves plenty room new jedi knight game kyle katarn hunting down his wayward apprentice	1

i think its safe say this game sucks ! before i got this game i thought it would great . i heard so many good things it . once i got it though i realized this game wasnt great everyone said it would . graphics ok but gameplay sound dont impress me all . plus you dont get your lightsaber until level 7 unless you use cheat codes . all talk you able use force force pretty weak this game . you also dont get force until level 7 some missions you cant even use all your force power like lightning , push , pull , ect . really only good force power grip . ( grip allows you choke people)another thing sucks there different powers force so when you finally get force you build up your power force few levels ( wich could take hours ) finally get your force power strong enough kill enemy , not just wound him . this game also extreamly hard . its like metroid prime you get lost it'll take long time find your way around . if you still want get this game after reading this review suggest renting it first . ( dont dumb like me buy it without renting it . i wasted $50	1
if anyone played any final fantasy games then im sure they would love it . it dosent greatest graphics but it sure worth playing . only thing made me want pull out my hair how long begining !	1

this one those games fall into multiple age catagories . one hand , it looks purely like kiddie game cutesy-poo characters saturday morning cartoon feel . other hand , dialog ( lots it ) this game purely adults , quite few tongue-in-cheek risque jokes , comments situations . ( warning ! possible spoilers next sentence ) - like what beatrice scuba gear main character getting high mushrooms . cases not very easy , yet not very hard . some stories so childish i felt embarresed playing game , some so funny i call someone over read what screen . then i embarresed once again because i asked why i playing " little girl game . " that kind game this . short regardless " who hell this game made " dilemma , i highly recommend it anyone , any age . it highly addictive , extremely well written high quality point click presentation .	1
i am mother four . i three boys ages 2 , 4 6 little girl age 3 . this game fun all us . you play up four players game fun watch well play . my older boys so much fun playing this game hours hours . we've won game countless times started over again scratch . game many levels lots tasks . graphics great challenges fun . my four year old little trouble some harder parts , but my six year old able take lead ease . great game family fun , cheering each other playing game familiar faces characters they love movies . * it bonus each level , four characters change make it more interesting	1
i'd start off saying morrowind one most unique rpg i've played . it least immersive engaging baldur gate 2 or planescape : torment . developers accomplished what they wanted ; make game where one he/she pleases . there countless ways play through this game ! playing through thief type character far different than playing through more combat oriented character . world huge , it takes hours upon hours explore . there so much if you don't stop turn around sometimes , you're bound miss enterance anscesteral tomb or smugglers cave . now some technical things . i'm running this game p4 , 2.53 ghz , 768mb pc2700 memory , geforce4 4200 ti gpu . game runs great 1024x768 resolution full shadows distance . since graphics little dated , i more than excede recommended system , i've chosen install sevaral mods ( which great way keep this game fresh ! ) . most notably , " better bodies " , " better heads " " morrowind comes alive . " first 2 make humanoid people look less blocky more realistic . morrowind comes alive adds many more npc ( generic travelers , ones something offer ; it goods sell or hostile bandits nice looot ) random places , giving game even more immersion factor . over all , i highly recommend this game . fact , i bought it keep me wanting play world warcraft , it worked	1
i love this game ! it not too hard kids play ( my 10 year old beat it max points finds all secrets ) it not trashy so parents let their kids play it , they keep it clean kids some adult humor but nothing raunchy , it also cool so us adults play well ! i love creating skaters parks kids love secret skaters like jesse james jester etc . graphics better this game than others my opinion also .	1
i liked this game . i mean final fantasy vii still god final fantasy game but this ok	1
i love this game i it snes it one my favorite	1
phew - i'm relieved able recommend this game . i've played them all - order . i really didn't enjoy last two , so i bit concerned . but her interactive got lot things right this one ! interesting mystery , puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into plot . not too much repetition tasks - hooray ! only reason it wasn't perfect , me , i really didn't learn too much . my favorite games ones where i walk away bit more knowledge something than i before going . this one - not so much . i also small objection ending . " treasure " , so speak , completely out park . there nothing indicate leading up it this what we seeking . , history buff , i hated seeing such " treasure " indeed relegated back-burner used throw-away very end	1
this note those you trouble running this game , this game works xp however you need combo drive includes dvd writer/ . . combo writer i installed this game drive it works perfectly	1
this game awesome . definately 10/10 . there constant action you upgrade your abilities weapons become stronger added effects . if you're into games like devil may cry , or just love hack ' ' slash , you need pick this one up	1
games released , product you should beable get it freeware or amaturish remake . even dos box emulator comes it cannot opened without file which you must risk downloading third party site , . rar files not open themselves you know . like vivandi , microsoft too chincy develope internal download programs this job(as easily they could ) . vivaldi compounds this afrustration not even putting install program job . you cannot run these games out emulator you cannot use emulator it unopened zipped up thighter than paris hilton jeans . four stars " fun " confounding waste time trying config it without getting virus " two crapola quality compatiblitiy it requires xp despite not able work it ! also king quest 6 not include enhanced windows version which better grapics portraits animaetoins . who works vivandai again ??	1
i am huge fan this series . when i found out they releasing all games xp i extremely happy . however , king quest 7 problem chapter 5 firecracker exploding when it picked up causing endless loop forcing you restart entire game . this only problem xp previous game i expected it fixed this release . however , when i got point game i picked up firecracker it exploded right away . i could not believe this . whole point this release port games xp they didn't even properly . this known problem they didn't even fix it . this makes me extremely catious buying anything vivendi future	1
i love fps genre . there just something running around blowing things away relieves day stress . said , if you're new cod games like i then there some adjustment . it not straight run gun kind game . one , varying degrees movement strategy required get your enemies without getting taken out . second , if you're used plasma gun 400 rounds then frequent reloading historical weapons take some getting used . but all this adds great interface , graphics , especially storyline this great game . i can't wait call duty 3	1
disclaimer : i am not employed or associated any way game publisher or developer . i am just consumer . i put disclaimer because people tendency point out all positive game reviews here " planted developers " . may true some cases , but , not here . civcity : rome not without it flaws . mouse cursor bug known issue high-resolution settings , game developers acknowledged this releasing patch soon . how this slipped their beta testers beyond me , but , i'll agree some others here , it nearly game-breaker . aside , if you love things set ancient rome , like me , if you love city builder ( cb ) pc games , like me , you'll absolutely love civcity : rome . don't fooled title , game absolutely nothing civilization series games . it more like blend caesar iii simcity , heavy influence stronghold ii thrown into mix . i personally spent many hours playing game , medium difficulty , i find interface in-game advisors extremely easy navigate . some stated game interface " clunky " hard navigate ... i would love know what game they comparing civcity : rome , because , interface slick very easy use . graphically , game beautiful look . those who say graphics dated living fantasy world . just take look screenshots ! admittedly , graphics not pretty those upcoming caesar iv game , but , they very well , especially newer systems . tutorial manual both very generous well , in-game voice acting charming appropriate , gameplay challenging addictive , learning curve what you would expect any city-builder . i strongly suggest anyone interested city-building games , especially ancient rome based games , check this game out . it well worth 40 bucks you'll get many hours enjoyment . if you high resolution monitor , you may want wait first patch , though . cheers	1
this game rocks , you've got action , storytelling , quests , your own path , linear gameplay , world alive , people jobs work times play times . controls little quirky , but worth hassle	1
since heady days arcade favorites such asteroids , pac-man , missile command , people claimed video games help sharpen your reflexes keep you thinking fast . but there never seemed any hard science back it up . over 20 years later , nintendo releasing product nintendo ds squarely aimed hard science , making claim playing brain age : train your brain minutes day " make your brain feel fresh sharp . " well , we're not scientists , so we can't necessarily prove or disprove claim , but budget-priced game , brain age strangely compelling , even though its very nature brutally repetitivethe touch screen ds microphone make whole game possible . it really slick way play game , but it also reliant your handwriting ability speak clearly . when you're rushing through math problems , it easy squiggle down something game misinterpret . this extremely frustrating , you're penalized mistakes . voice recognition doesn't come into play very often , you bypass it entirely if you like , but we trouble getting it recognize certain words . over time , you figure out exactly how game wants you write speak then adapt it . most part , though , recognition pretty impressive , especially considering there no calibration process involved . overall : this game isnt really one those games you look foward when you get home whatever you , it one those games you look foward bring something , thats why it usfull game made portabal system . great game roadtrip	1

this game one ea best efforts outside sports genre recent years . it feels little like grand theft auto but also easy use format common ea games . while it violent , there no rewards killing pedestrians , doing so creates hassel your character . true mob form , you bribe police officers , but killing them isn't usually best alternative . weapon system this game great . you start out buying or picking up basic weapons beginning purchase more efficient accurate weapons later game . old stand-by shotguns , tommyguns , pistols , dynamite , even bombs all available purchase . if you into character development , this " sandbox " game you . it allows you gain experience ( respect ) you use upgrade any 10 different skills . if you fan classic movie , you probably won't dissappointed either . while game takes place parallel action film , it fairly well even though micheal looks nothing like pachino , other major characters all show up . james cann plays sonny gusto makes cutscenes pretty entertaining . customization great too , those tired playing one gta characters you forced those games . you change appearence , clothing , body type , among other things . gameplay solid , shooting system far more rewarding than most third person shooters . game took me 25 hours beat medium difficulty 10 get all unlockables . trust me , this great game pretty good replay value .	1

original lego star wars great little lighthearted romp game : amusing way play out three most recent star wars films virtual form . lego star wars combo proved also terrific formula game space , generating experience lego star wars oftentimes even more entertaining than source material it based . like any good sequel , lego star wars ii improves original almost every way . but most importantly , it good episodes now . reason alone , lego star wars ii one most enjoyable games this fall . featuring story lines characters new hope , empire strikes back , return jedi , it hard believe any star wars fan ( which , what , pretty much everyone ? ) wouldn't love this game . while gameplay pretty standard action fare most part , it somehow made so much more fun because lego characters . levels could perhaps dismissed lackluster other games absolutely work here . star wars scenes comically recreated look sound great ( though , nitpick , some john williams music samples don't play their entirety , making you wish more ) . but make no mistake , even those without predilection star wars enjoy this -- it combination great story lines , characters , comedic elements provided lego makes it all work . game designers clearly fun it all -- you'll continuously entertained how they incorporated elements film into gameplay ( often taking some rather humorous liberties way ) . lego brand clearly afforded them freedom fun star wars license . while most gameplay consists run-and-gun action , there lots puzzles found -- many which quite good , even though some rather unclear objectives -- several missions take place vehicles ( at-st walkers x-wings ) . while vehicular stages vary terms quality , mere fact so many exist really adds scope game . lego star wars ii offers surprising amount playtime , much larger longer than original game ( which one its biggest criticisms ) . once again , you control group characters pertain scene , allowing you easily switch them fly order take advantage their unique abilities . unfortunately , though , your . i . -controlled buddies kind clueless times offer little support battles ( while they fire , it all show -- their shots inflict no damage enemies ) . game far better when second player joins play ( game joined any time ); it loads fun o-o experience . it just shame lego star wars ii offers no online support . what also neat game there lot outside standard mission structure . there lots collectables gather , secret items discover , hidden areas unlock ( certain areas aren't immediately accessible first playthrough -- only return using other characters they opened ) . option build your own custom characters parts taken others ( such c-3po equipped darth vadar head ) amusing well . there definitely lot fun lego star wars ii , making it good choice those looking solid action-platformer ; it ideal choice those fans star wars . it also perfect almost all ages , offering rewarding experience even younger players . all many versions ( xbox 360 , ps2 , pc , xbox , gamecube , psp ) look essentially same , pc version offering better resolutions xbox 360 version more visual effects ( though it unfortunately priced $10 more than others ) . rumor it developers traveller tales more lego games works after this ( including one based batman ) -- here hoping , this formula simply works .	1

first off , many people said , game wonderful movie -- less so game itself . i am not habitual player rpgs sake their gameplay , however -- i stray toward puzzle-solving instant-action games lines ecco dolphin metroid series , respectively -- but i appreciate intricate storytelling genre allows . xenosaga really goes overboard sake its story -- there nothing wrong . game pretentious , open pretentious . cast characters all , greater or lesser degree , mentally ill , heroes villains back again . story takes sudden whiplash-inducing turn last third game . morality decisions made distinctly nietzschean -- which say , often amoral confused . bu t--t he critical but!--it wonderful story often because these facts . if you'd like good story chew over talk your friends ( i'm still talking it , three years after i introduced it ! ) , buy this game . if you want instant action transparent storyline -- eh , give it try . it can't hurt anything . but understand -- when you're going into i t--t hat this more movie than it game ; objective entertain , enlighten , even disturb through visual medium , not necessarily through gameplay itself . oh , , there plenty eyecandy both ladies gentlemen . always bonus . 8	1

i know , i know . but i playing online since days text-based mudds . most you reading this way too young even know what mudd , but back 1982 , we playing them . yes , i said 1982 . i've playing online games just long seen evolution just every type online game environment you think . i've played battle.net, heat.net just every other online gaming service ( free or subscription-based ) there play over last 20 years . many you may not even know what xcite means , but they responsible online gaming 16-bit systems ( sega genesis super nintendo ) . i those too . amp ; quot ; so after playing online nigh 20 years , i ask myself what earth xbox live ( xbl ) going so much more better it than any other online experience than i ever , amp ; quot ; this what i thinking before i signed up , i very skeptical rightfully so . but once i playing , my tune changed rather quickly . all years i playing online , there simply no single experience fun , exciting solid xbl experience ( yes , even ps2 online experience inferior xbl ) . it quite safe say , they last 20+ years online gaming ultimately leading up xbl . microsoft taken all best attributes online gaming infused them into xbl , while leaving all worst attrtributes cutting room floor . check this out , they constantly improving experience . while you xbl subscription , all upgrades service free charge . we get upgrades improvements every few months . xbl experience so good , many even pc gaming communittee prefer xbl over pc online gaming clamouring get xbl pc - later this year , they finally it . then there all tons free stuff you get xbl . i cannot remember just how many new levels modes maps soundtracks various xbl games i downloaded last year absolutely free . almost 100 games available use service number looking more than double itself end 2004 , that just even more opportunities downlaod more free stuff my xbox harddrive . inconclusion , xbl really best online gaming there ever date . however , you not take my word it , you find out yourself absolutely free . most xbl games these days come 2-month trial card free game box . just use sign-up temporary account you get full access all xbl services free two whole months . that two whole months full access best online gaming service ever created . if then you feel this not you , then you free cancel service without further obligation . you cannot lose . anyway , i play xbl everyday , i hope see some you there soon .	1

two rpg masterpieces , final fantasy iv chrono trigger , re-released this great package some nice additions . i'll reviewing two games . final fantasy ivintro : 1991 , ffiv originally released america snes under name , " final fantasy ii . " but snes version pretty flawed . one thing , they censored script it horribly translated . thing they took out few things , such developer room . also , they toned down difficulty . now game re-released ps1 complete , uncut script , developer room , harder difficulty . gameplay : this first ff game more than number characters your party . ( you up five characters your party . sweet ! ) game lots secrets , spells , weapons , summons . it really addicting rpg great challenge . graphics : meh . it made 1991 , so course graphics look outdated . but they good time . sound : not much say sound . it your standard snes sound . music : i love music this game . even 14 years later , music still packs punch . i especially love boss music . it very catchy . story : this game great story . i won't spoil it you , but story very original , filled plot twists . added extras : besides complete , uncut game , not much . just fmv scene . chrono triggerintro : ten years ago , ct released snes . even now , it still one most loved popular rpg ever . now it re-released ton extras . gameplay : ct rpg . however , there things special this game . one thing battle system unique . you use moves combine different characters . it bit hard explain . thing makes this game unique fact you time travel . you alter past , fun . plus , more eras mean more sidequests . graphics : very ahead its time . ct graphics beautiful , colorful 2d textures , forests , graphics topnotch . music : like most rpg , ct epic musical score . sound : pretty good 1995 . story : story , i believe , solid . it isn't best rpg story ever , but it easy understand very entertaining . replay value : most rpg don't really replay value , but this . once you beat game , you new game+ , which allows you start game over everything you first game . plus , there many , [ i mean many ! ] endings unlock . added extras : awesome anime cutscenes , much more ! overall : two epic rpg one package . must .	1
if you always wanted turn based strategy game fantasy setting no limits then dominions ii really only option out there . its not perferct but its darn good . story , if you really call it , world dominions once one god . one day he just wasn't there all sudden everybody their brother decided try apply his job . all these " pretender gods " kill off all other gods put their religions out commision order take over world become true god . start up new game dominions ii you need choose one 17 different empires then pick your pretender god dozens different avatars . you play darn near anything you imagine ordinary , like arch-mage , outrageously exotic , like fountain blood . every pretender god strengths weaknesses some may adept only one or two paths magic while others may learn many ease . you also pick castle set up your own " dominion " which effect your god his followers his religion spreads across world . but isn't all , you still haven't actually started game yet . next you create game picking one nearly dozen huge maps setting all game settings such victory conditions difficulty neutral provinces . lets not forget , you also choose which 17 empires playing if they human or ai players . game itself huge very few limits . your empires unique units may built any province which you built castle but every proince game also its own units may built there inculde many none empires usually access . plus units may equiped different armor weapons such there may well hundreds unique units game maybe even thousands different equipment varaitions . like pretender gods , units come huge array simple , like light infantry , wild , like werewoles vampires . combine fact there hundreds spells game research , hundreds magic items forge find , random events almost every turn , no two games ever end same way game nearly unlimited replyability . combat bit unsual . all units , order move around map or attack , assigned commander . commanders built same way you recruit normal units but they only lead so many men . however , you assign units under commander many squads you like each squad well commander himself issued specific order such casting spells , using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes battle field . downside all this you set up all this before hand during your turn . combat occours turns you no control over battle . its entirely up your units follow plan you laid out them . better or worse this system certainly original . but some things game really bother me . my biggest complaint game computer ai . its not thats its too stupid or too smart . its actually bit like terminator , it allways seems know where you sends wave after wave seemingly endless foes after you . it can't reasoned , it can't bargined it won't stop until one you dead . no diplomacy options units like spys , assassins scouts extremely rare expensive most games aginst ai just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks huge armies killing each other over over gods throwing spells each other turn after turn . problem game manual which huge but contains no information isn't easily available game . its same problem evil genius , manual awful all hints should hae manual hidden games loading screens . i hope you read fast . grapics obviously aren't exactly par half life 2 or doom 3 but they work , however i've got take issue music sound which downright awful . you better get used hearing same three music tracks over over . over all , dominions ii far best turn based fantasy game i've ever played . room improvement obviously here but this game should keep you occupied long time	1

i big fan first kingdom hearts , it truly unique game . melding worlds final fantasy disney very interesting idea , its one worked . kingdom hearts ii continues same basic formula , so if you liked original , you most definetly dig this one . everything oringinal well , ii improves . combat system vast improvement over original , it remains fun over 30+ hours . fact , i wish there more experience . its fun . if your disney fan , you dig able fight different disney characters explore those worlds . all very well diverse , some particular just breathtaking . pirates carribean world comes mind , its just awesome . you actually feel like your apart world you fight captain jack sparrow . voice acting animations add too immersive nature . its amazing how well they get johnny depp character , you would think it his him game , when he actually nothing production . square characters get some great treament game well , you run into many them . you'll even fight side some them thats treat well . if your final fantasy fan , you absolutly eat up more ff inspired moments game , it more than makes it worthwhile experience if your not into disney . real draw me story . one best most moving stories i've ever pleasure playing . its very interesting actually . surprisingly , you start game not playing sora . you play roxxas first 5 or so hours . it serves introduction world , but roxxas key character story , you blast playing him . thing i liked story wraps up quite well , you not left hanging . it satisfying conclusion , much better than first games ending . square enix once again shows why they one best business . kingdom hearts ii very polished product , art style , character designs , music , down extremely well fmv . its not without flaws , it tad short me , i finished it under 35 hours , it supposed much longer . but regardless , its incredible journey well worth devoting time play	1

no , this game isn't perfect - you'll annoyed dialogue ( luckily you fast forward through it ) cut scenes ( unfortunately you can't fast forward through those ) . but it filled tons things solve , if you get stuck , you game solve it you . this game keep you busy while ... but fair warning , it corny	1
not quite programming-sound sands time ( sot ) but thankfully far removed warrior within ( ww ) , two thrones ( tt ) arguably most enjoyable three next generation titles . visually , tt masterpiece . advancing upon beautiful artwork first two offerings , tt presents gaming environment gamer truly grasp his/her eyes around . lighting , facial expressions , body language , even pottery specifics all drawn perfection . audio sync these strengths ; music terrific , sound effects digitally crisp ( step your first dinner plate or pot get sense this ) . moreover , gone most blind jumps ww , camera glitches sot . characters themselves weapons they carry likewise individualistic works art . ubisoft montreal obviously thought this one through ( flaws previous two entries ) when creating visuals . control scheme similarly quite polished . sot still lays claim tightest all 3 , but tt close behind . perhaps by-product visual environment truly interactive . stealth mode blast perfectly fused into game dynamics . pure gaming perspective , absolute genius . dark prince hoot play + wonderful change pace , challenges face you suitable gaming stage you encounter them . unlike ww , secondary weapons now key elements gameplay . weapons racks appropriately placed provide weapons edge when needed . finally , puzzles , while ocassionally more frustrating than fun , conquered . prince persia veteran most likely not require faq ( stalwart ww , unfortunately ) conquer tt . newbie require moderate-high learning curve . this game , however , not without flaws . several reviewers refer frustrating encounters game ( second chariot + boss battle follows most obvious ) require dual save points sufficient sands time stored well advance proceed past . not mention glitch might require restart entire game . ( ugh . ) these by-products second rushed title , expedited keep gamers interested after poor ww . someone who played every prince persia title since its first offering , tt nice return its roots . new gamers -- alluded above -- i highly recommend playing out entire sands time series its release order . tt both make lot more sense while seeming more intuitive result . not mention storyline keeps you glued ' just one more save point!'highly recommended . fascinating discover what where next prince persia appear .	1

star wars battlefront allows you play some best troops ever , such rebel alliance , imperials , republic , cis ( confederacy independent systems ) . 3-d graphics make it easier enjoy ; well sound storyline . battlefront , you not play featured characters saga , but you get fight alongside them epic duels . disadvantage you can't wield lightsaber either . instant action , you get pick any location , any side fight . you also choice choose clone wars galactic civil war . matter fact , you drive vehicles , but no space combat ! if you want play episode iii battlefields , your hopes up . only locations episodes i , ii , iv , , vi . there numbers areas battle . but pros cons , cons going hard time through game such : what type soldier ? where my command post ? where my enemy ? pros there nothing wrong . star wars battlefront one best star wars games there star wars , perfect gameplay , terrific graphics , great sound . i highly recommend game any star wars buff out there	1

i bought this game whim ; i am not spyro fan . first few hours , i found it quite enjoyable . it colorful graphics , cool moves , even some humorous aspects . unfortuneately , it unbelievably frustrating . i'm quite skilled platformers , but this game required perfect timing , accuracy , etc . all this led lot anger my part . still , i might managed work through it ... if it hadn't broke ! yes , that right : when i tried turn it again , xbox refused read my saved file . i must admit , i no desire start over . eventually , i sold this game ... my xbox . sorry , vivendi ; sorry , bill gates . you'll both come up something less faulty next time	1

i play this my friends . we all grown men . we're so pathetic but we don't care . when we play , we randomize our characters cars . it really makes game interesting . it totally sucks when you get stuck some losers like wario petey piranha . all wario throw lame bomb never hits anyone , petey piranha head so big you can't see road front you . i prefer donkey kong toadstool . if those two characters ever come up me , game over dude . usually i'm champ but last time we played , ron won . but we'll see who takes it next time . anyways , go get this game . you'll get your money worth then some	1
this definitely game racing fans people who love tuning cars . this game they actually exotic cars ( porsche , lamborghini ) , which makes it even better . they also added cops this game , which they never previous underground games . now game . this game there alot cars . you race old school muscle cars tuned up race car . even police nice fast cars . but they really tough times ( especially suvs ) . storymode actually kept my interest throughout whole game ( unlike others quite boring ) . there blacklist you must beat order become #1 most wanted . this blacklist , there 15 experienced street racers you must beat order get top . they each their strengths , so it get quite challenging times . cool but same time annoying thing when cops interfere middle race once you beat race , you escape them . so it very interesting fun . gameplay , it actually easy get used , even though it may seem difficult . it also not complicated ( ps2 version ) , it mainly like previous need speeds . so you'll learn it like after first race . graphics one things caught my attention . it just so smooth seems real . videos also seem very realistic always fun watch funny ( when you get busted woman ) . overall , there not much else say except , go out buy this game if you love racing games . oh yes , buy black edition	1
this game best i ever gotten . i've got " pin tail ed . " but i can't seem get pass hard parts . also , this game deserves oscar !!	1
addictive game , which kept me up well past midnight . if you enjoy maps , urban layout planning , patient strategic thinking , this game you . ( don't buy it if you action-and-adrenalin persuasion . ) it take plenty system resources . i own dell xps 3.2 ghz machine 1mb ram , there still few bells whistles beyond my reach ( it helps sophisticated video card , which i don't ) . campaign mode annoying ( they give you too little money get started , bad things start happening too quickly ) . however , sandbox ( scenario ) mode joy play . you use scenario editor fill your treasury brim before starting game , get rid all distracting " disasters " ( plagues , god wrath , etc . ) prevent you doing what really fun this game : building roman city . you specify everything : which goods produce ( finite but ample enough menu ) , which buildings erect , where place them , how quickly grow , how much export/import , how much store or consume , where place your plebeians , patricians , soldiers , etc . course , city run properly , there things you can't get away ( people eat , don't like living ugly neighborhoods , need access running water , so ) but these restrictions merely imply you ensure functionality aesthetics , which part fun . there several maps choose , you even build your own ( although here program shows its weakness : editor not all friendly when it comes map editing , lead crashes ; first time i tried it , i overdid myself reinstall whole program , so beware ) . key improvements i would recommend number ready-made locations offered : there too few ( only 3 , fact ) . all other locations destined campaign mode play , therefore not modifiable all , which pity .	1
i love this thing . it awesome . older version ds little clunky childish looking . this thing rocks my socks off ! it sleek , sexy , portable . it like ipod video games . you don't buy batteries . it comes extra stylus . its screen brighter . sound stereo ! this thing super dope ! it freshest thing out there ! you gotta get one . sell your old ds here amazon put money toward new one . you'll love it	1
this game very fun lots action sure . many people may find this good enough game satisfy them , but i am not one them . mythology part good creatures gods described portrayed very well , but plot campaign messes it all up . last campaign much larger it more fun . i disappointed new campaign . i'd say first one better . if you make big deal graphics though , than this game you . it excellent graphics features . ocean mountain looks so realistic . they good job showing you underwater . these graphics blow away graphics age empires series . if you expecting good campaign , your not going very happy . plot isnt so good its very short . it half other games campaigns . big difference normal games titans always come out . they're kind annoying . overall this game good but not good prequal . graphics-10/10campaign plot-3/10music-6/10mythology-9/10overall-7/10	1

i am huge fan world war 2 first person shooters . i've genre since begining medal honor . since then , not too much more impresive me than call duty . it wonderfual game still . call duty 2 even better . this new game maintain stellar streak series ? word , yes . although , it alot more same . but then again , why mess great formula ? call duty 3 works because it exactly what original game built around , sheer intensity .... also alot fun . but then you might say , well i've played cod2 , you saying its same ? yes no . basic mechanics same few newly added gameplay elements little nothing overall game so escense . yea , its same game . but this time around levels bigger look o so much prettier . honestly , these some most amazing visuals xbox 360 . i dare say it puts my beloved cod2 near shame . lighting texturing beautiful explosions heart stopping behold . life like graphics complimented brilliant musical score . oh , if anyone should wonder ingame soundeffects , just pop previous call duty game imagine it amped up even more . seriously , battlechatter never so nicely integrated . cod3 yet amazing world war 2 game certainly keep veterans genre happy content , meaning edge your seat . newly implimented rag doll physics destructable enviroments make sure you stay there too . i reccomend this game anyone everyone who played world war two first person shooter enjoyed it because what we here ladies gentelmen latest greatest , best money buy	1
castlevania : dawn sorrow first 2d version castlevania , i played long time . well onest , first one since castlevania ii : belmonts quest , came out nes back 80 . i never got play super castlevania , or amazing psx versions(which i should , after playing this game , buying 2 previous gba games ) . this amazing change ot games me . original , it really hard beat , made you frustrated . ii fixed it little , made you search dracula body , then destroy it , but frustrating , you no real direction most weapons tended suck . this however , amazing game . it eases you into game , you lot hp your disposal , regain them(take 1980 games ) quite often , potions , or save point , or souls . souls great thing , am loving it previous game well . they range you not taking much damage , growing tail , shooting lightning or bombs , letting you throw doll , switch places it . i enjoyed this game , determined finish it . i don't currently 100% , but my first time through i got 98% which nice , because i played games through , you finish 48% you completed entire game . touch screen not used often game , but when it used it used well . you only need it destroy few blocks way , input magic seals whihc you need defeat bosses get through certain doors . it plays great , although you cheat not hit points perfect , long your quick(which good thing , most people not perfectionists , or if they , really slow ) . game difficult , but not overbearing like many series past . i loved this game , play it long time , even though i beaten it before . i try julius mode , which more traditional , difficult castlevania game using belmont(finally ) whip , no souls , no potions , it tough , but i enjoy it greatly . if you own ds , you need own this game	1
it great game featuring awesome engine , single player campaign really good , multiplayer ok , totally recomended	1
even though there several good reviews already here , this game already couple years old , i still feel compelled put my two cents my favorite game . i've played number other first person shooters , but no other game comes even close . fact , i trouble playing other fps now because they lack so many things make far cry exceptional . this game definitely not everyone though . if you more interested shoot-em-up alien games like doom , or story-driven puzzle solving shooters like half life , then you may not like far cry . if , however , you like me , prefer strategic , calculated shooters without too much fluff , then far cry definitely game you . so what makes far cry unique ? large scale , graphics , level design , balance come mind . i still not seen game better overall graphics . levels huge open-ended , giving you freedom plan your approach . this gives game plenty replayability - there numerous effective strategies each level - well enabling each individual player use his or her own style . game hard , it uses checkpoint system , so there little margin error . normally i'd like option quicksave , but far cry checkpoint system works very well . quicksave system would ruin open-endedness game . more difficult levels , exposing yourself enemy fire spells rapid death . game close realistic this regard any i've seen . even easiest level , however , far cry no walk park . ai smart , uses strategy . it doesn't just rush you blindly , unless odds its favor . first level anything but tutorial , action starts quickly . game long , but contrary what reviewer said , i never found it repetitive , i've replayed it twice . levels distinct , each its unique challenges . this brings us gameplay - what separates far cry every other shooter market . may opinion , far cry perfect this aspect game . first all , vehicles play important role game . unlike many games , if you see something , you use it . there multiple boats , trucks , hang-glider - even forklift - each its place its benefits . then there weapons system . all guns far cry useful , well balanced . you carry four weapons , which again , me , perfect number . just enough add variety , but not so many make game totally unrealistic or so few it becomes annoying . this brings me controls . this area where far cry beats out every other fps , my opinion . you come equipped binoculars , which track your enemies , essential component gameplay . you stealth meter so you know when enemies becoming aware your movements . instead just always running , you find yourself stealthily crouching avoid enemies . last , but definitely not least , you crawl . i no idea why this isn't implemented more games . crawling provides you most stealth , steadies your aim considerably . since there only few places game where you run guns blazing expect stay alive , crawling vital your survival . you lean fire same time . i also never seen these two combined game - i think all games should this feature . so , conclusion , this far my favorite shooter , if you like any same kinds things i , then you should buy this game immediately . its only weakness it requires fairly good system run smoothly , number large patches . if you like exploring beautiful environments , spending time planning your approach , making full use your range controls regular basis , then i highly recommend this game . it intricate very challenging . just writing this review makes me look forward playing it fourth time	1
we rented this game my kids play each other . game labeled 1-2 players but made only one player single ps2 console . kids disappointed because now they take turns watching each other . aware	1
if you've played one madden game you've played them all , most part least , madden ' 07 almost carbon copy madden ' 06 . this incarnation contains all essentials , franchise mode , all nfl teams including all afc , all nfc nfl europe historical teams . create your own player , fan or team then play single games or entire seasons . all usual mini-games madden cards back , well online play those who network add-on ps2 . nfl superstar returns ' 06 , giving you opportunity create player set random ' genes ' or parents , which give wide array player attributes , determining how good your player what position he starts . you also opt load ncaa ' 07 heisman players continue their illustrious career nfl . within superstar you control only your player when he field , option controlling or not controlling your team when he not field . after several seasons hopefully you've gained enough statistics ' cred ' make it into hall fame . both franchise superstar modes allow use different ' roles ' each player aquire meeting certain criteria , these roles increase attributes your player other players your team , or decrease stats players opposing team . some these stats negetive too however , such distracting players or under-achievers . control scheme hasn't changed years . ' truck stick ' now ' highlight stick ' works pretty much same way . qb vision cone back , but this time optional ( better or worse ) . hit-stick defense less picky this year moving stick any direction attempt big hit , opposed hit-sticking direction ball carrier previous games , course your chance clean hit less than your standard diving tackle , ai seems better juking this year . playmaker controls lead blocking controls hangin ' strong extremely useful , practically essential harder difficulties . before snap audible control far more depth than previous games , allowing audibles formation , plays , or just individual routes . playing defense also little harder , relying ai play your defensive backs let up 3-4 big plays td every game , harder difficulties ai just useless stopping run . i gave this game 3 because apparent lack effort ea part deliver reliable product . this game lags , freezes some loading screens buggy all sorts ways . graphics even seem little choppier . credit this all work 360 ps3 versions game , both wich leaps bounds ahead this generation madden games . one game i played , end third quarter 1 second remaining ( ticking away ) , i snapped ball only ref blow his whistle . game froze second , ball then snapped 0:00 clock i allowed continue playing normally , however 4th quarter never started . game would go eternity 0:00 left 3rd quarter . overall it same package you come expect ea madden , probably one last we'll see current generation consles , which good thing my eyes considering lack attention attributed this game favor new ones . customer should always get what they pay , standard retail price ea delivers game which feels neglected , but still madden its core , contains enough what matters not collect any dust until ' 08 .	1
this thing awesome , i recommend premium however cause core cause absolutely nothin	1
don't let screen name fool you . i'm actually guy . but , getting out way , i'm really into music , i eyetoy , so i got groove . it atmosphere extremely feminine , but this great game . there only 23 songs begin , grand total 5 unlock . ( yippie ! ) however , girls , this very good party game , guys , try it out . you'll feel like pussy , but you'll fun doing it . overall , this great rythm game , but it minor leagues when compared its awesome competitors , like dance dance revolution guitar hero	1
i bought disgaea when it first came out thought it great . fun , funny , many long hours game play . when 2 came out , i excited . it didnt let me down . many features improved first game . assembly much more wieldy now . item world more controlled . battle more challenging . they also removed ridiculous overpowered character aka angels majiin took forever unlock only obssesed players get em	1
game quite fun play , though it little really offer way replay value . unless you fan both final fantasy series games their elaborate storylines , well fan fps ( first person shooter ) types games , i would probably warn you this particular offering may not your cup tea . it nice get bit more backstory continuation final fantasy vii game ... one best overall series , but gameplay sometime get bit two-dimensional stale . all all , it short but exciting romp through familiar world ... it could more , but it okay what it	1
i got this my son christmas . we all played enjoyed it . my son just loves it .	1
those looking fast paced side scrolling shooter not disappointed . those who value their free-time away video games should look elsewhere . r-type final offers rewarding shooter experience provided you challenge it " human " ( normal ) difficulty or higher . it hardly worth playing lower settings due lack any real challenge . this game offers 101 different ships you play . unlocking them both rewarding aggrivating . everytime you unlock high powered ship , you'll enjoy exploring its capabilities battle . however , novelty only lasts one play-through most . other hand , flight time you log particular ship unlock new ones truly absurd . sometimes you log over two full hours flight time ship unlock new one . battle mode interesting challenging its own way , though i honestly would preferred inclusion two-player mode . while r-type final no means perfect , it rewarding experience those looking relieve heyday side scrolling shooters . just anticipate loosing many , many hours your life unlocking new ships	1
i really enjoy top down side scrolling shooters , so take this opinion mind . only problem r-type dying sucks . when you die you restart usually bad position without any powerups . once you unlock free-play this make game frustrating when you playing new stages or playing different ship etc . however overall i think it best r-types one better side scrollers out there .	1
i won't say cooking mama best game i've played recent months . surely , there something more important than cooking - like , killing zombies x360 , example . however , it certainly most innovative , especially when you consider how much you limited dimensions nintendo ds touch screen . cooking mama , you're apprentice fine art cuisine management . your master , certain mama , put you through series saliva-inducing recipes , grill you through preparation each if it only thing you live . you choose practise before hand , but when you go into actual process making particular food , you'll find there no room error . wrong move , mama not hesitate show you her wrath . making food involves several steps . some short , while some may take forever . example , when preparing pan-fried fish , you'll go through coating fish slices , melting butter , actual pan-frying arranging plate . each process turn involves different ways doing things . coating fish slices , example , requires you drag your stylus left-right manner while touching fish . melting butter requires you rapidly drag butter circular motion when it hot plate . pan-frying involves " following command on-screen " mini-game requires you perform whatever mama tells you , so . impressive thing here , even though you're just stroking your stylus throughout game 70+ recipes , you're essentially doing different things . it bit like trauma centre last year , but instead seeing body parts , you're looking food . if you're more adventurous , you even combine recipes form new ones , which adds depth gameplay . game quirky this , it understandable it uses quirky graphics . presentation cooking mama light-hearted , makes hectic process cooking ( me , least ) much more enjoyable . music little weak , even though it some nice variety . but seriously , graphics audios not what you'd buy this game . i mean , who cares these things when you've fried octopus balls make ? its sheer audacity bringing kitchen onto ds , i'd recommend cooking mama every owner ds . don't expect see your ds few weeks , however , if you bought this game , missus house . now , if only my wife learn few tips out this	1
this controller very nice probably best . it works big small hands it feals non greasy(unless you greasy hands ) it nice vibration if you notice some other controllers vibration too big . now i own playstation 2 i played lot other controllers but they dont last buttons get pushed analog too sensitive etc . although this controler ive it 2 years it yet break me people this sensitive object dont slam it it work well long you take care it . also button reaction this quickest i seen those big bulky ones reaction very bad sometimes analogs dont work properly . you may also seen this controller black teal there all same price all same durability only differene color . i rate this item 5 stars because its best controller out there	1
3rd party controllers tend suck , so buy this one instead . it light weight , comfortable , symmetrical ( great fighting games ) , rather durable . plus , blue color rather good thing . if you already own four working controllers , there no need get this thing . but if you don't , i'd recomend pickup	1
good comfortable controller ( better than n64 ones ) . it works much better than 3rd party controller , such madcatz . if you plan , or played " super smash brothers melee " (great game ) you notice how much easier it pull-off moves nintendo brand controller . it worth extra money , no-matter what it says third party company package ( dont fooled third party controllers extra button : " " button , it nothing because nintendo brand controller doesnt one developers design games according nintendo brand controllers ) . i never use my cheap madcatz controller ( madcatz controller often malfunctions well ) , this one much better , black goes everything . my rule thumb : nintendo brand game accessories more reliable , longer lasting , eye appealing overall better than third party distributers . * please vote yes if i helped	1
this great controller , it rumbles ( unlike wireless one ) . yeah , it wear down time , but it far one better controllers because it doesn't ruin your gamecube it more durable third-party ones ( aka those not liscenced nintendo ) . i first third-party gcn controller some reason , it stopped my gamecube reading discs . i get it repaired . if anything , if you want good controller , don't go third party stuff . go original like this , one : they last much longer two , they don't ruin your hardware . it may look plain , but it would better plain working controller rather than quickly defective pretty one . also , official wireless if good , if you don't mind lack rumble	1
i am using " brainage " game this . very challenging i improved my performance .	1
overall this very fun game . initially i disappointed wario ware not launch title , but this game gives you everything wario ware more . there variety fun challenging mini-games . first person shooter games hilarious . definitely worth picking up .	1
leave it me start into series its ' second , third , or fourth installments . this case , it fourth . course , there good explanation why . i set out looking final fantasy iii : dawn souls my gameboy advance(hey , if you're going collect series , it good thing start beginning ) my local videogame store but they only final fantasy iv advance so i decided get it instead . there isn't much i say hasn't already said other reviewers here final fantasy iv advance . story goes like this .. kingdom baron quest collect all elemental crystals . commander its air force , cecil , dismissed after questioning king motives . help others ; cecil sets out stop growing threat , meantime , uncovers far more dangerous one . it deep story alot twists turns deeply challenging game due active time battle system . i can't recommend this game enough . it one my all-time favorite final fantasy games . although they tweaked graphics , translation whatnot abit , they pretty much made game it originally . i think final fantasy fans well casual rpg gamers really enjoy this one .	1
i just bought this game last month , played all way through it , including unlockable side quests . i'm not going write much games story here , there plenty other reviews already . all i'm going write game itself . anyway , after playing all way through game , i say i like it even more than original . script much better , music sounds much better gba . one thing i particularly liked this game all new unlockables ! after beating game , you unlock new dungeon explore , well really cool music player ! if you go down extra select " music player " main menu , you listen all tunes melodies you heard throughout game ! my personal favorites include , hey cid !, rydia , theme love , chocobo-chocobo , dancing calcobrena . unlockable dungeon , lunar ruins , very cool ! fully unlock every room dungeon , you beat zeromus once each character . after , you get some really cool extra tasks each character ! i wont spoil them you , but just them game highly increases overall replay value this game . now pros cons this remake ... pros:it same old game you used love , but some cool upgrades additions game play . new quick save feature allows you save inside dugeons towns . some text old game fixed so now all magic spells aren't abreviated . example : meteo fixed read meteor . new unlockable music player side quest dungeon ! music sounds much sharper gba , you really hear seperate instruments playing unison . this version old , unedited script , which far more convincing durring game play . cons : unlike final fantasy chronicles , this game not include chrono trigger . they changed sound effects some moves , changed names some moves . example , meteor doesnt make screechy noise anymore , ( which i thought sounded cool ) nuke changed flare . battle , there seems lag reaction time when pressing down buttons ... ( you press button , but it takes second register command . ) 50/50 : none graphics upgraded , but if you're like me , doesnt really matter . if you're like me , already played final fantasy ii snes or final fantasy chronicles psone , buy this game ! it well worth price	1
my 8 10 year old love this . i highly recommed it anyone . it helps teach kids how sing pitches tones . kids love dress up their characters . even boys neighborhood get invovled . i see this lasting years come .	1
i don't know how extoll praises this game loudly enough . we plugged it christmas morning entire family friends playing it ever since . selection songs excellent . sing dance feature brings sends this game way out front earlier editions ( which we also ) . eye toy good addition . just everything it first rate . i can't think single drawback . my only suggestion you purchase game make it experience entire family , parents too	1
i really , really enjoyed this game . it only game i played almost 2 months , i so hooked it . my only criticism missions too rigid , so outcomes very much same during re-play , even if you make different choices . i thought it really neat character changes according what you - e.g. too much eating , he gets fat .	1
i like it so far , i think new features going cool once i get better them . i just don't like they made precision passing more complicated , they changed kicking , but i think i figured out . i beat computer 52 points , so i guess i am doing okay ( never mind i playing texans , ha ha ) . i haven't really used precision passing though ... just gotten lucky my passing most part . i liked it it me ' 06	1
this our 2nd karaoke revolution we original one well . it amazing see how they evolved . family 7 there not too many games allow us play individuals . well this game delivers more !! boys love minigames , girls love change their characters clothes based how they feel all us love sing . we not von trapp family any means but we certainly fun . that what game delivers . after long week stress / work school , we saturday night karaoke . kids love it !! this far best investment into family time we ever made	1
what i say memory cards ? well , they're nice looking , their colorful translucent casings . i've using mine month now , no problems	1
i never played original don't really want . this game such treasure find it phenomonal music graphics , engrossing gameplay , twisted plot , variety characters possible play . i lost lot sleep over this game i'm not even half way . if anything , it some best show ps2 graphics i seen-something expect square-enix production . wind moving through environments , water trickling , sort-of dream-like haze towns . it all culminates into eye-pleaser if nothing else . but gameplay game engineering also top quality . character designs very diverse many periods time cultures represented . there fairly even mix female male characters well classes like archers , light warriors , mages , ect . menu navigation ability load different game data anytime ( other than combat ) serious perk many take granted . you keep loading game when you don't get einherjar you want until randomized selection gives you perfect group you looking adventure . ability instantly travel any location map without lengthy travel location location keeps pace nice brisk giving you only what you want , buying equipment battles . difficulty right where it needs , if you quick run game , you tough time beating boss . it nice not leveling forced you but rather elective thing so you get through story when you want . battles clever , mixing tactical rpg action making it very engaging actually fun . there degree button mashing , but then again , it not static or boring your turn , my turn , cast spell , drink potion . it actually combat , like it should . i can't praise this game enough ... i don't care how good first , it can't better than this one . this certainly go down best title ps2 . if i any complaints , it would recycled voice-commentary different einherjar fact they really aren't involved main story-line . oh , since they would stupid not make third one , customizable armor would cream crop . vp2 solid offering last ps2 offer	1
i all final fantasy games except viii . i just never got around getting it . i purchased viii two months ago i currently beat it . i though it well worth playing . storyline great . each charcter brought something spectacular game . i never put it down . ending alone worth it . 10 10 best story gfs . trinity	1
i am scratching my head why everyone thinks gun such terrible game . i bought it few weeks ago reduced price , i really enjoy game . graphics quite nice , voice acting really good , gameplay itself entertaining . i really enjoy open western environment game . basically , gun structured like grand theft auto game once you pass first few missions , you find yourself open environment you free explore , take up side missions , or start actual missions game . some side missions include ranching , participating pony express , working bounty hunter arresting or killing fugitives , playing texas hold'em saloon , hunting wild game . completing these missions improve your characters ' abilities , such they tie overall picture . gun features quickdraw mode fire , which essentially same feature used max payne which slows down gameplay allows you make precise targeted shots . feature i like gun fact your character able buy weapons items , such weapon upgrades , improve his overall strength . you earn money through completing missions side missions , mining gold , winning gambling . many people complain gun too short overall story not very in-depth . while there some truth this , you should not pass up your chance play gun now it reduced $20 . fact , this game actually steal $20 . it much better game than people give it credit .	1
i friends love western themed games . i must say this got me glued ps2 . it not fair say it better than red dead revolver . rdr lot features gun not . eg : slow motion gun showdown . ok gun , only two cons short . two it relatively easy . but please note there : 1 . variety missions . 2 . variety cool weapons . 3 . interesting game story . i only more games genre come out , it seems popular . thanks , nawa	1
i bought my 360 pro summer 2006 , it i got oblivion , ghost recon , nfs most wanted hitman blood money . everything going great until two months ago it started freezing regularly . i didn't pay much attention it , but week after i got three rings death ... yup general hardware failure !!! i got little frustrated , but i immediately sent email microsoft my situation . they answered within 24 hours said system repaired . i shocked because i don't even live us !!! i started calling my local video game stores none them fixing 360s yet . after i called like 5 stores , i called small store middle residential area guess what ? man told me his 360 suffered same problem he could fix it !! i little skeptical , but anyway i took my system there left it overnight . my surprise next morning i got call him saying it fixed !!! i couldn't believe it , i asked him how much he going charge he said : oh ! just give me 20 bucks . then he told me six months ago his 360 same problem , he bought both pelican fan stand nyko intercooler he hadn't problem since . two accessories together both make like 33 dollars they prevent your console frying , so its absolutely worth it , just try follow warnings people who bought two fans posted , because they very important , could mean difference messing your xbox up letting you play countless hours without overheating . last games i bought splinter cell gears war now i'm able play 5+ hours without console even getting warm touch my fingers . yes system overheats ; you just take right measures solve your problems ... hope this review helped , cheers	1
this game lot fun . level control actually less challenging this one then original music isn't good this newest version , but this game certainly still strong choice those rainy days	1

i've through doom3 now three times . first time i didn't even cheat . i won't go into how great game it but stick few short comings . one , game started off perfect . little bit realism goes long way but later degraded into world comic bookish nightmareism ... skeletons missile launchers their shoulders come ! bugger man rocket launcher pace right hand .. aaah ! it isn't hard figure out why id it , they trying spice it up bit keep it interesting ... i understand , i just don't agree . two , no mass attacks monsters use up all your hard won ammunition . instead you transport our marine h-ll once more search find same things all over again -- all these games ! monster nazi helmet whip -- more comic book filler . three , game cheat every other room searched gets little irritating . you know monster other side darkened doorway . you throw dozen gernades there , monster isn't hurt . you take step forward , monster jumps out you blast it . then -- course -- monster which appeared out nowhere behind you , attacks . answer course walk backward , trip ' if then ' statment program , shoot monster behind turn around shoot one front -- your second attempt get through door . i get tired computer gamecheating because i makes me cheat beat game . i don't mind dark areas , whole base just went h-ll , i would expect lights not always work . four , i've heard those h-ll knights destroyed big green glowing plasma gun/cannon . well , i it thirty eight hand grenades ! game would -- i think -- better if two or three turn loose roam hallways looking humans munch randomly . five , basically , never enough fighting room . understandable station world pressurized atmosphere . rooms would all small . exploding barrels pressurized enviroment , what hoot ! yuck , yes i said yuck instead number , belted ammunition machineguns usually came 100 round belts -- not sixty . mini guns used chained belts -- i know , i use repair them . plasma gun munitions travel far too slow . shotgun needs longer barrel so it still choke keep pellets spread out too wide becoming useless after ten feet . handgrenades can't thrown properly . light machinegun firing rate half what it should ... goodiness sake , get some duck tape flashlight tape you weapon . list could go these ' little ' things ... but game easily worth money . remember , these mostly suggestions id future program	1
i so excited over this package . 4 games one all them got pretty good reviews online so i checked it out . awesome !! this package definatly worth money . black white very unique game ive spent hours playing . freedom fighters amazing . i loved squad aspects action . lotr very cool but i some framerate problems even tho my comp exceeds recommended requirements . only reason i gave this package 4 because medal honor doesnt work my computer tech support not help all . i've heard good things moh so if it happens work your computer then just makes this deal even better . this great package i recommend it all . i got all cd keys all games so other reviewer who not must just unlucky . :	1
i enjoyed most aspects this game it quickly becaming addicting . there great satisfaction beating people up plenty opportunity fine tune my skills . overall though , this game definately easy side . compared grand theft auto games , which i never able complete , i finished this one just over week . final challenge particularly simple i really expected more . still , i'd recommened this game , however rent it , don't buy	1
just add my 2 cents already glowingly-reviewed title , couple more clues how well-received this game : 1 . after selling through initial stock , capcom stopped shipping copies game . uproar gaming community ensued existing copies started selling 2-3 times srp online auctions before capcom announced they ship more copies . 2 . e3 there trailer revealed phoenix wright sequel ds , which sequel original game japan but titled usa " justice all " . if you up unconventionally written games quirky charm , this fun title sit back , relax laugh .	1
somebody tell me if ps1 dual shock controller works ps2 ? thank	1
after 8 hours play so far , i gotten lot more enjoyment out this game than i when reading first three books series ( which themselves probably took less than 8 hours read ) . where shall i begin describing this really fun game ? 1 . characters themselves realistically animated , sunny animations especially amusing , way she bites things , squeals , little dances , etc . i've smiled laughed lot just how well characters represented . 2 . voices very good , including use some major actors appearing upcoming film , although their use not pervasive during normal game play . 3 . scenario great fun - far more involving than books so far ! playing piano break it apart get it open real riot !!! settings creepy , little roaches crawling , rats spiders such . 4 . game reaches level art !! who soundtrack ? music awesome wondrous ! after dingy mansion count olaf , there episodes light relief fill player sense peace wonder - library scene , uncle monty house garden . garden butterflies flapping , grass blowing , wondrous music playing , big tree adventure klaus flying over greenery , rivers , etc . finally made me see this video game reaching level artistic accomplishment - like good painting , just get lost enjoy all details sensory input . wow ! first i concerned i might get through game too quickly . after 8 hours though only midway through , i know i'm getting my $40 worth , i surely play through whole thing more than once just one watches favorite video or takes hike favorite forest path . i calculate $2 per hour , this game giving far better return than seeing film theater when it comes out ( although i plan too ) . that not even counting game resale value afterward ! addition , there some special game features tie film - players eventually awarded film photos , information , a/v film ... one extra note game players i don't think players get great deal benefit bradyguide this game . game guide poorly mapped far comprehensive , while instruction manual comes game itself gives enough instruction detail allow players start proceed . save yourself $15 avoiding bradyguide , because map you make yourself while playing likely far more useful . halfway through game so far , i only got two useful tips guidebook , i would figured those clues out my own anyway ..	1
this game good cheap now buy if you didnt before if you cant afford gun 49.99 buy this game cause they copied it	1
totally awesome . my favorite game ever . sound revolutionary , graphics top notch , it so real you'll freak . although , ps2 version four extra levels thirty minutes impressive new dialoge cinematics , so i would buy ps2 version if i you . must own every gamer . it change your life	1
all right , i'm quite sick seeing people hate this game . i am addicted black white 2 . soon you get past whole tutorial business , it free-for-all . there couple problems . first , this game not run any old machine . it better fast good video card supports pixel shading . sound good . after installation issues , you get game . when you first play game , tutorials extremely helpful . i first played game laptop , stupid camera rotating sounded , i actually needed know how change view my fingerpad-mouse laptop . learning completely how interact world without refer manual i think really good . when you replay game , tutorials seem redundant , but anyone remember tutorials give you tribute order buy advances your civilization ? now when you're trying aquire 1,000,000 tribute get volcano miracle , every little tribute counts . so bare through tutorials again quit whining . if you type person likes simulations ( any maxis sim games , any civilization series , example ) , this game highly addictive . i personally don't enjoy gore violence every five seconds appreciate building civilization part . you truly get control how game goes . plus , after you win land , you stay there long you like grow metropolis until entire island covered your houses buildings . it obviously not casual gamer type thing . beating game challenge , it should , but same time it intriguing fun . i just sick seeing people give it such bad reviews . leave black white 2 alone ! just because you aren't competent enough complete this game or need shoot something every five seconds doesn't mean this game bad	1
expensive but worth it - it just works . no more wires	1
there two major factions when it comes video games , if you weren't aware their existence i'll happy illucidate you . group 1 , far most numerous , console gamers . group number 2 , one which i subscribe , based pc games . i'll first admit pc gamer i tend view consoles suspicion my experiences they place looks , flash , hefty price tags above gameplay plot . console audience tends younger than pc group , these very aspects which appeal them . so it equal parts hesitation excitement i felt i put this game onto my hard drive . those not know , once upon time , back early days microsoft x-box , there this nifty game called " halo " , my how console gamers snapped it up . i saw commercials tv course , thought it looked pretty good , but felt it too bad it x-box title not one available my trusty ol ' pc . " halo " puts player squarely armored shoes master chief , one kind super-marine engineered bring big guns covenant , consortium deranged religious aliens bent destruction all humanity . no ship allowed go earth it location closely held secret which covenant wishes possess all costs . but earth losing war , precipitating creation new super soldier , spartan-ii . just before spartan used covenant home planet latter launches surprise attack facility destroys all but one ; you . gambit elude pursuit last ship left , pillar autumn , jumps into hyperspace ends up orbit around strange ringworld named halo , but immediately attacked their pursuers , who seem tracked down autumn no time . now , complaint number one i this game stems fact * everything * i just described not taken game itself . it comes game manual . plot this interesting should least included opening scenes . c'mon microsoft , you money , pony it up spruce up introduction . it good plotline , so don't waste it manual , which only kept desk drawer some juvenile next 10 years forgotten until next decade spring cleaning . plot ( first gripe ) now aside , let focus game itself . i refuse judge game it age , too many nowadays ... instance , i still play original half-life think plot gameplay more than make up aged graphics . game looked fine my pc i never experienced anything close screen lag . colors contours alien world ship hallways nicely rendered sound ambient noise above average . music itself nice choral sequences ( such featured menu screen ) downright cheap midi sounding music , which felt out sorts rest game . weapons selection small but surprisingly good , any given situation you'll likely access weapon/s needed surmount it . i particularly like plasma pistol it supercharged shots , well everlasting mainstay fps games , shotgun . ability drive vehicles included game , something separates halo most other fps , it lot fun . particular i loved driving scorpion tank , which demolishes everything it path . you also fly around enemy banshee light fighter , which made getting past couple levels much easier . game plot flows smoothly voice acting pretty good . now gripes . right off bat i say level design single biggest detraction this game . beautiful outdoor environments used this game , but not * nearly * enough . you'll spend most it traversing hallway after hallway , which connect rooms look * identical * one you just left . doing this 2-3 times enough , but when you spread out level runs outwards up 3 hours * same thing * , it gets reaaaally stale . case point , chapter/s which you spend time monitor traveling through library . this section game draining seemed without end . it wasn't fun , just stressful . level which player introduced flood felt much same , although it still lot fun . vehicles fun , but require mouse steer . this obviously remnant x-box , where players steer warthog control toggle-thing , but i found mostly it me skidding against walls occasionally flipping . ghost only vehicle i able use strafe keys assist steering . enemies themselves tend get little stale after while , during my first couple hours playing i wondered what i gotten myself into . grunts , little pointy-backed gnomish aliens , spend most their time running away speaking ewok-accented english . it very distracting considering nature other baddies they seemed little out place . lumbering hunter , who super armored , also incredibly stupid . first i trouble negotiating them , but soon learned employing certain attack patterns i could easily waste one under minute . other aliens tend use good combat tactics i found dealing them more difficult . plot itself , which i classify very good , bordering great , kept me interested . it ain't half-life , but it works well enough my curiousity piqued halo 2 , which i might go ahead buy near future . i'm sure halo released pc first , which what originally intended , it'd left recognizable mark fps shooter platform . so that . very good game one which i look forward continuing storyline master chief , killer extraordinaire !	1
aside instant impression may put reader this review i'm reviewing this game only because it multiplayer , singleplayer actually what i look game . multiplayer just extra me , however , halo ported pc online multiplayer front mind ( halo xbox originally intended xbox live multiplayer abilities , but this feature never made it into game ) . halo amazing singleplayer campaign remains untouched ( which good thing ) . if you new halo craze , story takes place humanity alliance alien races known covenant . after narrow escape enemy fleet , usnc ( human alliance ) ship named piller autumn finds itself strange ring world covenant call halo . when ship boarded covenant forces , escape pods launched ships surviving crew find themselves halo , attempting learn it uncover it dark secrets while franticly fighting through armies covenant all while . you play spartan 117 , known simpily master chief . you breed super soldier , created turn tide losing battle against covenant . stronger , taller better equiped than average marines , you savior battlefield . game 10 massive levels , many vehicles easy fun use , while same time , not forcing you use them . you jump out vehicles . you pick up any weapon lying around , it human or covenant . however , you only carry 2 weapons time ( not counting grenades ) . you encounter few different species enemy troops way , such ... grunts- chunky little guys who don't much damage , even if they're groups . they however use plasma grenades , which kill you 100% if it sticks you . if their forces thinned or if stronger unit leading them into battle killed , they usually panic which sends them running around screaming . elites- backbone covenant forces , elites carry plasma rifles ( higher ranking elites carry energy swords ) deal out powerful melee attack . they also use energy shield similar yours , making them equally difficult kill . they usually work pairs or larger groups often seen leading teams grunts into battlejackels- these back-line troops . they hide behind hand-held energy shields fire plasma pistols you . they dangerous groups , but they tend shoot you while you're fighting other enemies , their shields difficult take down . hunters- these huge enemies extreamly powerful fule-rod cannon ( only weapon you can't pick up ) mounted their arm dish out melee attack sends marines flying . their armor impossible penetrate , so you'll shoot them their small exposed areas armor plates . they always deployed pairs well . you also encouunter race alien spices later game even covenant fear . graphics now better than xbox version ( provided your computer run it maximum quality ) . if anything , i just miss xbox controler ... which why i like xbox version halo better than pc version . , halo still everything xbox version only online multiplayer battles . thanks people who play halo multiplayer , however , it not very enjoyable . i don't know what it halo causes it online community mainly populated 10 year olds who never learned how not swear all caps every time someone kills them . that not worst it though ... teamkillers . halo multiplayer completly infested them . every time you turn around team oriented battle , teammate shooting you face . if you're headed vehicle , you should lookout teammate who doesn't think you worthy using it ... all time . if it wasn't this , it would great multiplayer game . problem they didn't add campaign 2 player o-o , which practicly best part halo ( xbox) ! so , your reasons get this ) you don't xbox but want play halo without spend extra $150b ) you prefer pc fps games consolec ) you want good multiplayer , but aren't bothered bad communityd ) you can't stand play game unless it best possible graphical qualityoverall , halo hands down best game i every experianced ( i huge fan when it first came out xbox ) . though i still prefer xbox version , pc still great . compared call duty , however , multiplayer fallsa little short , mainly because people who infest it online servers .	1

there really not much say this kit , however i think it unfair it received such poor rating considering only other reviewer complaint , kit too expensive , inaccurate because one he suggests actually more expensive . however , this truly passport amazing gaming experience . xbox live experience truly something innovative relaly really fun , i would recommend buying xbox 360 despite next playstation nintendo stations coming out . however , i also recommend waiting til after christmas . rush get these now ridiculous , i seen some consoles sell over 800 dollars . why not wait til after christmas when there almost certain price drop enjoy what this xbox live pack offer	1

after playing grand theft auto iii , i thought there no way rockstar could top themselves . fact , when advance word this game got out , i actually thought this nothing more than add-on gta3 . stupid thought , i know ; whole , gta : vc bigger , badder , more audacious than gta3 ever . so , here story : 1986 , tommy vercetti -- hitter forelli crime family liberty city -- finally released prison . sonny forelli , his boss , immediately sends him down vice city close major drug deal handled ken rosenberg , shyster lawyer forellis ' contact . no sooner deal closed than gunmen break it all up , kill everyone but tommy ken , take both drugs cash . now , tommy recover money sonny ... but before long , he decides make name himself this town . setting pure ' 80s excess , through through . if you take bottomless amoral corruption scarface , day-glo polyester fashion miami vice , innate cheesy greed ronald reagan 1980s american culture , you'll vice city . you'll see it fashion sense citizens , local architecture , cars tooling around road . you'll even hear it radio stations , which boast array heavy metal , dance , latino , bubblegum pop music like which you haven't even thought since ' 80s . i swear ; try listening one radio stations see if memories don't come flooding back . voice acting , usual , superb . ray liotta outstanding job bringing tommy vercetti life , making otherwise loathsome sociopath into strangely likable character . there others well ; burt reynolds , dennis hopper , gary busey , lee majors , fairuza balk , robert davi all turn great performances . but philip michael thomas , who played don johnson partner tubbs miami vice , gets special mention ; more ways than one , his character -- lance vance -- one keep eye . while main story missions only take up third game itself , it addition new feature not only rounds things out , it also adds length game , really makes you feel like you're establishing criminal empire . they're called asset properties . certain point game , you option buying certain businesses . once you buy one these asset properties , you complete its mission strand , business start generating daily amount money you pick up . some them perfectly legitimate , such taxi company or nightclub . others little sketchy , like boatyard or strip club , but others absolutely illegal , like protection rackets , " ice cream " company , or car showroom . they add great amount depth , they let you establish contacts across town . needless say , once sonny forelli comes town " check up " you , make no mistake ... he now your town . so , if you feel need get away it all indulge your inner tony montana , book trip vice city . like san andreas , it great place visit unwind ... also like san andreas , you'll glad you don't live there	1

i always loved mario , when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite , i bought this it . this game absolutely amazingly fun ! graphics , sound , game itself incredible . this game good any adult or child . although younger child , it might bit more difficult possibly frustrating . ;) this game you try some harder levels over again , possibly again after . but every time you try again , you understand something new level , it really fun . there also features becoming mega mario mini mario which mixes things up every once while . this game wonderful , definitely great buy .	1
... which ok . i think if they made this game fully controlled stylus touchpad it would make it bit wacky . sort like mario 64 ds . like mario kart , you 2nd screen your map . but you also use it use items whenever you like also jump area area whenever you wan t.t hat really jist this game when it comes new features . someone wrote " loosely based " off old 2d side scroller marios , but actually this very much based off them entirely . only difference environments characters full 3d yet still side scrolling view . which nice touch watching 3d models move around like . other then it nice update old classics . especially big mario which you never get much play thanks use giant mushroom . vice versa mini mushroom causes mario shrink ( only way access other levels defeating enemy bosses mini mario ) . there also new shell costume which mario dons , but quickly get out control if you run fast he spins all over . all all it very fun game , entertaining , but not very hard , which good young folks but those reminiscent old days know how hard it beat mario game back then , this surprisingly easy . luckily game packed mulitplayer features mini games add value they . not all entirely fun , but majority make use touchpad make up not using it much throughout game . playing 2 player always fun course , unfortunately it not wifi so you within range someone else game	1
not really into original gta iii ( its birds-eye-view predecessors ) , i became unfortunately addicted san andreas . game play absorbing storyline cinematics , despite dated graphics , engaging . maybe most impressive aspect entire game impressive cinematic scene voice acting , which makes you forget some jerky animations . game play free-ranging , but if you don't pursue main storyline missions ( which linear , but multiple storylines let you pursue them any priority ) gratuitous violence you commit ultimately unrewarding difficult get away ( it should ) . moral criticisms game include able randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions , but most part , there repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so . my criticism would there not enough repurcussions street violence , because it would certainly make aspect game more challenging . if you go rampage local store , clerks don't try call police or evade . they instead just take beating or bullet . ai some rival gangs little clumsy too , they simply start shooting you if they see your colors , despite presence squad cars or bike cops across street . cops san andreas corrupt , but not corrupt . gta sa definitely feels like ported title rather than game developed pc . some interface in-game menus awkward designed ps2 gamepad friendly . saving game bit pain well , since you retreat your " safe-house " save everytime . fun engrossing game adults , but let this known : if you let your under-18 child play this game , you awful parent deserve social services come whisk your precious babies away . aside violence , san andreas rife profanity innuendo , probably not really suitable anyone under 40 . there no " safe " mode or low-gore level this game like some other titles ( while game overly violent , gore minimal anyway )	1
well i picked this up star wars fan . i little worried first game didn't really rock my boat but i really want like star wars rpgs so i gave this one shot . i finished it marathon time enjoyed it . it one major bug but there fixes out there if you run into show stopper . graphics par original but ithought story superior it kept me interested till end . i look forward next game series now	1
this component cable offers clearer , crisper picture my lg lcd hdtv than composite cable . however , it downside . clearer picture exposes edges polygons make up figures games , which you don't see composite cable . it makes them appear little rough , but overall it better picture	1

i played every fps comes out xbox . course i like halo , doom 3 , but love playing anything conflict makes i.e desert storm i ii , vietnam , global terror rainbow 6 series , since i'm army . half-life 2 far best game i played . i thought i wouldn't like it because it no map option or hints objectives , but all you time imagination you spending hours end playing this game . i bought it $15.00 game stop , but if i spent $49.99 i would not disappointed one bit . i not beat this game but put over 512 ( over 8 hours ) minutes into it . this definitely worth buying used or new , if you time you get your $$ worth out this game ! c-murde	1
story / gameplayin playing amaterasu , sun-god awoken defend classical japanese village area nippon , you use variety weapons , combat techniques , celestial brushes defeat your enemies rid land ancient evil resurrected . weapons your standard platforming arsenal short long ranged devices you use keep yourself harm , try opposite effect your enemies . these include various twists japanese imperial regalia include , reflector disk ( your beginning weapon ) , rosary beads ( your primary ranged weapon ) , glaive ( powerful long sword ) . celestial brush what makes this game unique . it allows you pause game any time using r1 button paint various symbols wide reaching effect gameplay . these include , but not limited , attacking enemies/objects , bringing back life various dead flora , creating platforms , general showing off your god-like ability affect almost every aspect reality game . celestial brush your major gameplay factor practically every puzzle game offers . it also used story progression helping out some your village friends think they things they really can't without them knowing . art / graphics okami draws lot it animations japanese watercolor paintings most famous ukiyo-e style . like game zelda : windwaker , which people most commonly relate okami , cel-shading used opposed 3d polygon textures give game more animated feel . this serves purpose bringing out smoother movements character models bringing characters themselves more life . unlike aforementioned game , however , okami uses brushed style helps bring more color into game rather than focusing solely shape definition . short , it best thing cel-shading ever produced . it even winds up showing off lot better than some cinematic driven games date . music / voice acting music this game par many its platforming brethren , exceeds lot standards genre . scores large numbered always seem good piece music back-up whatever situation you , brush wielding sun-god defending good form wolf , may find yourself . voice acting only thing could bring this game down . simple truth ? there none ! well , it no great loss because game fine without it . however , during opening sequence , which consequentially 14 minutes too long , little humming sounds they use instead probably you wanting claw your ears out before it . after this little sequence however , you should good go through rest game . controls i list controls its own category because quite simply , they make or break game . i won't lie you , i little skeptical when i heard somebody made zelda clone ps2 based feudal japan . but moment i picked up controller started maneuvering smoothly through cel-shaded environment , switching weapons brushes quicker than thought , i sold . okami some most intuitive controls any console game i've ever played . you almost never one those moments where you left thinking , " if only i put camera somewhere else . " overall okami fun action-adventure / platforming game keep you locked very end . brushed cel-shading quite frankly outdoes itself you progress through rich peaceful villages well dark brooding cursed lands . controls boast more than their fair share versatility they put your hands ability change very fabric existence surrounding your character just few buttons strokes your brush . downsides you see game mostly center distinct lack voice acting horrendously long opening sequence . these however , very little detract overall masterpiece clover studios created . okami takes everything made people love n64 gamecube zelda games , then improves upon them ten fold ( yes , i though it impossible too . ) create one most original masterwork action/adventure games ever hit markets , no competition whatsoever playstation 2 gaming console .	1
always , nancy drew games not disappoint . personally , i quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams , if no other reason than keep my cash flow going , tour rest town . i must admit , i bit confused why herinteractive wouldn't incorporated courthouse into game some purpose , but hey , it nice see they penchant detail . after all , what town doesn't courthouse ? heh . indeed , this game could designed twice enduring ( there several ways this could accomplished ) , but honest , enduring not equate endearing . every nd game satisfied me many levels , even if few levels left wanting . i also enjoyed going back time 1930 , albeit there few inconsistencies regarding what took place when , i.e. , turntable revolving wrong way , et al . ... however , good detective notice these faux pas . like i say , there rarely any disappointment when it comes nancy drew games . one only hope they continue create these games indefintely . my only gripe they come out only two games year . my wish would four or five . :	1
there 2 games this ultimate collection , iwd + expansion pack , other iwd2 . there bgm cd it . course , manuals included . this ultimate collection better than i thought , because i purchased baldur gate ultimate collection , too . but only game cds it , no manuals	1
like 90% people who played this game , my primary motivation playing through watch mini season 24 . story takes place during considerable gap time 2nd 3rd seasons show . actors show voicing their characters music script written guys who work real show , it should not too hard please me this game . respect , game fulfilled , but not exceed , my expectations . while i enjoyed watching this extra " day " , gameplay left lot desired . there quite bit variety , which nice , you get play almost every character show . there so many different types missions standard " get point point while shooting people " missions only made up 60% game . rest game involved driving , computer hacking , interrogating , sniping , such . this would really cool if all these missions actually fun . pretty much any mission involving driving sucked , since controls incredibly sloppy . interrogation kind fun first time , but it didn't need several times . there three or four different computer hacking missions got over over again , so they weren't much fun end game . rest game , i'd describe it mediocre . there wasn't anything spectacular gameplay ; there too many missions where environment so dark it impossible see where i going ; there no reason all there two missions involved shooting down helicopter . addition , there too many missions unnecessarily difficult , my opinion . one such mission , you playing jack you defend girl who defusing bomb . there basically endless supply terrorists who keep rushing out start shooting you , if girl takes any damage all she starts whining stops working . it wouldn't nearly so annoying if it weren't fact there doesn't seem any strategy whatsoever beating mission . i must made dozen attempts varying degrees success . i no idea what i differently when i finally beat it . pretty much any mission involves you protecting person extremely annoying , because person usually tend stand out open taking damage instead finding cover . despite fact your partner firing their weapon constantly , they never hit single enemy , so you take everyone out yourself . all , game worth playing through story if you're fan show . otherwise , you could find much better action games out there	1
kyle katarn once jedi knight . he once helped fledgling new republic its strugle against empire . until drommund kaas , when he confronted darkness himself , gave it . so he gave up his lightsaber luke skywalker , swearing never touch force again . he went back working new republic mercenary alongside jan ors , only other person galaxy who knew location fabled valley jedi , incalculable power it contained . he might lived rest his life way , only his blaster , his wits , jan , woman he loved , count . until they took one mission ended all tha t.t hey met desann , powerful dark jedi , his apprentice tavion . they , admiral galak fyyar , imperial scientist , trying find way artificially infuse force into living subjects , mass-produce their own army dark jedi . needless say , they succeed ... it all kyle fault . so what former jedi ? simple . take back your force abilities , reclaim your lightsaber , go hunting . this game great job improving combat force powers original jedi knight . your force abilities taken directly movies , none showy powers you saw original . you end up eight all ; four neutral , two light , two dark , but they're selected you automatically . you can't upgrade them freely you could before . lightsaber combat vastly improved ; they used motion-capture animate kyle his enemies , it shows . even lightsabers themselves look better , like they taken directly movies . enemies just what you'd want star wars game . they basically fall into three categories ; imperials , bounty hunters , reborn . imperials range stormtroopers ( killing them never gets old ) , officers , droids , engineers . bounty hunters four different races ; rodians , grans , trandoshans , weequay , they're pretty much interchangable . but reborn ... oh boy , they challenge . reborn result admiral fyyar experiements artificially stimulating midichlorian production . they're all dark jedi , they're all insane process . you'll want pay attention what color they're wearing when you fight them ; orange blue aren't so bad , green tougher , but red black ? ready fight . that not even counting shadowtroopers ... ' boss ' enemies nicely varied well . reelo baruk , criminal connection , nothing . admiral fyyar , his shielded power armor , like walking tank . tavion desann very crafty ; those two toughest enemies game . fortunately , you won't completely alone . jan ors fights alongside you briefly , republic soldiers fellow jedi knights . raven software even brilliant idea bringing lando calrissian ( voiced billy dee williams himself ! ) luke skywalker back you up . fact , fighting alongside luke one game high points ; two you squaring off against both stormtroopers reborn one area . my only complaint it over way too soon . locales just eclectic you'd expect star wars game , or movie , matter . you go abandoned imperial listening post , crystal mine under imperial control , nar shaddaa , bespin , asteroid base , imperial star destroyer , even yavin 4 , home jedi academy itself . every location find new ways challenge you , no matter what powers or weapons you time . but once again , it story pulls you more than anything else . continuing story what happens new republic after movies compelling enough -- i think we all wonder what happened after return jedi -- but framing it around events kyle katarn life puts you right there middle it all . kyle fascinating character , make no mistake -- kind like hybrid luke han solo -- but you're one directing action . you're slugging it out stormtroopers . you're slinging lightsaber against dark jedi . you're jedi knight . that best selling point i think	1

valkyrie profile rpg came out during later days psx . while it never achieved massive success , it went become rpg classic garnered very loyal following . fast forward 2006 , we see re-release this awesome rpg psp . however , don't make mistake writing this off plain old port . valkyrie profile : lenneth includes " new " high quality cg movies help immerse you story . graphics consist highly detailed sprites pre-rendered backgrounds ; when seen vivid psp screen , it just makes game look downright beautiful . some combos just awesome look . battle system mix real-time turn-based fighting surprisingly intuitive ; newcomers old pro no problem getting used it . first glance , it might look simple , but you progress through game , you'll find depth it makes it quite fun . main story , itself , very well developed ... even if this rpg doesn't follow traditional linear way telling it . one things i enjoyed most this game character " episodes " you see when you collect new soul help battle save valhalla . if you enjoy rpgs , or feel adventurous enough ... i highly recommend you buy this game . it definitely must psp game .	1

this one those games fall into multiple age catagories . one hand , it looks purely like kiddie game cutesy-poo characters saturday morning cartoon feel . other hand , dialog ( lots it ) this game purely adults , quite few tongue-in-cheek risque jokes , comments situations . ( warning ! possible spoilers next sentence ) - like what beatrice scuba gear main character getting high mushrooms . cases not very easy , yet not very hard . some stories so childish i felt embarresed playing game , some so funny i call someone over read what screen . then i embarresed once again because i asked why i playing " little girl game . " that kind game this . short regardless " who hell this game made " dilemma , i highly recommend it anyone , any age . it highly addictive , extremely well written high quality point click presentation .	1
my husband just bought this my five year old daughter ( preschool graduation gift :)) . she hasn't able leave it alone . now , she little more advanced world gaming than some her age , definitely better than me , her mom - so i can't recommend it every kid - but if your kid adept x-box - they should enjoy this one . it doesn't hurt she loves movie well	1
no way should children playing this game . it mature players subject matter could confuse younger players . goals harming people , picking up hookers , breaking law , blast long everyone knows it just fantasy . many people go into details so i'll make this short . good time while pretending bad guy who unforgivable acts . but there no way i would consider this game anyone under 15 , then i would know teen handle fantasy .	1

don't get me wrong , both games anthology excellent . i would consider final fantasy vi , greatest rpg ever created . but " greatest hits " version this package dissapoint . original black label version anthology created squaresoft , included package extra cd , music both games . however , black label edition out-of-print some time . newly formed company , square-enix decided re-release anthology " greatest hits " , but excluded music cd package . so , instead receiving three disks ( two gaming disk , one music cd ) , only two game disks included game . square-enix release anthology feels much more like cheap cut-and-paste copy final fantasy . besides lack music cd , much artwork previous black label release gone , instead , gaming disks designed standard white label . final fantasy anthology square-enix , certainly not collector item , despite what package label might say . it my suggestion pass this purchase up , find copy black label release squaresoft .	1
yes this game easier fighting game , but that why i like it personally . most marvel fighting games , there so many controls remember activating many different types superpowers it got hard keep em straight . this game only 2 basic fight options all characters it much easier figure out what you doing . course , each character it little extras such flight storm wall climbing spidey , so each character remains unique . but you don't memorize 10 different actions wolverine then memorize 10 different controls venom . i like this game lot i really love they made fighting controls easier	1
i absolutely loved this game . i couldn't stay off my computer , it addicting . game long but puzzels clues really get you thinking , it very entertaining i would recommend it everyone who loves mystery . i can't wait until next one comes out	1
i bought this game my nephew he loved it . i haven't played it but my sister apparently , everytime i call her she playing .	1
you've read lot reviews get this one , most likely , they've gone how great it looks ( it look tremendous ) , how fantastic gameplay ( it awe-inspiring ) , how just absolutely great gaming experience it . there few things i would like add . first off , there one slight problem game . personally , action games 3rd-person variety , i like able control camera . this game not . instead , you taken where gamemakers want you go only what they want you see . this very slight complaint , one i'm hoping improved god war ii . second thing i would like add mythological aspect this game great ! it really gives game very epic scale not found great many games . it thing drives this game farther than it usually would . it tremendously entertaining , t-t imes thought-provoking , game sense gravitas most action slice'em-dice'em games this type get . get it	1
all you non-believers out there , buy this game ! i like you ... reading reviews , looking box various stores , pondering , considering , thinking myself , " should i buy this game ? " now i finally spent mere $20 played game , i am wondering why i didn't so sooner . avid playstation supporter , ( stood line hours paid over $600 my ps2 back day ) , this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment . cinematically driven storyline , supurbly coordinated character control , creative levels character design , great soundtrack , decent bosses , pretty cool power moves , , ( importantly ) , puzzles not overly frustrating point throwing your controller through tv screen ... except maybe climbing rotating spike columns . closing , all i gotta say same thing i said my first sentence this review ... buy this game	1
i rented contact gamefly , played it few days before deciding i am going purchase it no t-t oo-distant future . unfortunately , gamefly not rent games instruction manuals , so i learn everything game trial error . even so , i doing pretty well if i say so myself , stop myself playing anymore so i wouldn't waste purchase later . :) it reminded me other rpg-type games i've played past , such nes ' original zelda . if you liked zelda , you'll probably like this game . but buy it , or borrow friend who'll loan you manual too ! help may make all difference ! :)	1
we just saw wonderful movie picked up game way home . i'm 39 years old terrible games . this game sweet lots fun . food fights , soccer , searching things . if i it anyone . merry christmas one all	1
yes , i am die-hard star wars fan yes , i love good mission-based action game so man , if this isn't perfect game me ! it so much fun there so much freedom game itself ! add space missions wow , this game totally blows me away ! highly recommended anyone who star wars fan , fps fan , or fan fun gameplay	1
great game , higly addictive , gets really tuff once you play veteran mode ! definately game your collection .	1
this game amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! only problem order get some achievments , you play it veteran mode . sometimes you near end level checkpoint occur right middle battle . one time i getting shot tank it saved game . only three shots kill you . i restart whole level it took me hour complete it .	1
this enjoyable game , educational well . price , it worth buying . puzzles aren't difficult , but challenging enough keep it interesting . game reminded me easier version myst . you don't need prior knowledge physics - handy reference guide available part gameplay . only drawback screen small . maybe could fixed , but i didn't want mess setup since some games finicky xp .	1
i agree some reviews rush need keep up happiness tied immigrant status . said - i spent endless hours researching building thoroughly enjoyed this game . well worth cost enjoyable . i am not familiar other civ games - looking more city building game set past , similar my favorite game children nile - perhaps explains why i not disappointed	1
this perhaps best final fantasy games , sadly , most under-appreciated . ix amazing animation backgrounds , beautiful music score , solid gameplay . characters some most delightful series . personally , i think vivi zidane coolest characters ever . lastly , gorgeous cut scenes deliver beautiful epic storyline . sidenote , this game definitely deserves remake . there lot hype final fantasy vii , its own prequel remake coming ps3 . i feel final fantasy ix should remade ps3 . i love story line better than vii , graphics way better , gameplay incredible	1
this controller feels great your hands . fact , after using this controller awhile , my batteries went low i switch back dualshock controller . dualshock felt wierd my hands . response controller good . i controller long time now not experienced any lag time . one down side controller i returned two controllers because they stopped working short period time . i guess 3rd time charm because this one working fine after almost year	1
gothic 2 only rpg i ever replayed ; add-on included this gold version enhancing expanding original game fantastically . i live uk where this version still not released ( why ? ) , so get copy i order it sent friend states , who kindly posted it me . gothic 2 living world where things happen around you people get their lives - go work , then pub , maybe cook some food then home bed , example - animals , prey getting chased predators . quests interesting much more than just take this package so-and-so . some faction quests you even get see play other side if you replay game say , join guards instead merceneries . add-on some brilliant new areas , quests creatures whole thing wonderfully integrated into original game . gothic games only games where i gone practised my swordplay fields , fighting more than button bashing . fighting actually fun these games , not something i say any others ( although i high hopes oblivion ... ) . british gaming magazines criticised gothic 2 : -you not able choose your appearance . who cares when you look believable your armour weapons change ? anyway , playing first person more immersive than third person then it doesn't really matter what you look like . -the voices not very good . ok , you get recognize some actors ' voices playing different parts final " things " ( i don't want give any kind spoiler away ! ) voices bit pants , especially what they , but it doesn't matter because rest game so good . -not enough stats/skills raise personalise your character . ok , so there not vast range skills stats , but enough make you choose where spend your points specialise , so what more you want ? 50 different skills choose instead 15 , say , not make better game . ultimately , if you like rpgs , you should buy this game many hours pure fun . maybe you too decide it too scary go out night instead find nice bed you sleep night away , or bench sit admire view whilst waiting dawn some light see what coming next ...	1
i love this game ! i love training exercises , able compare them other who creat files my game , i especially love sudokus !!! i feel smarter already ; -	1
this latest ds game i purchased , somehow it happens educational fun . it gives you fifteen different training tasks sudoku boost your brain age ( 20 years best 80 worst ) . they're all preaty neat they all use touch screen or mic . only problem sometimes writing voice recognition numbers words isn't so great . besides , games like math facts sudoku very addictive . so i recommend this cheap price ($15 ) addictiveness , which well worth it	1
i am great time playing this game . i play it almost all day . i like fact you get choose your own people play . i get arrange different people my best estimate challenging game	1
very good game classic dungeon crawl captures essence dnd game compute	1
i've playing final fantasy games since beginning . buy spells , weapons , everything reminds me many early games , which good , my opinion . course , it odd also pay license points them . it not really bad system , there , though . voice-acting , though not worst , still not great . then , again , i prefer japanese language tracks . way i see it , they subtitle these games , if someone too lazy read , they shouldn't playing rpg begin , since always big part any rpg . now , worst part this game : camera . sometimes , it seems jump anywhere , except where it would useful smaller areas . plus , when you try pan left , camera pans right , when you try pan right , camera pans left . i talked someone who played ffxi , they say it similar , except camera pans way you press . i think it meant like , but someone miscoded , rather than take time fix it , they decided just release game . plot , though i not gone far game , yet , seems rather decent plot , though still rathr generic . course , it diffcult create nongeneric plot these days , since most plots already used . favorite rpg : chrono trigger . favorite final fantasy : final fantasy ix . least favorite final fantasy : final fantasy viii . least favorite rpg : sailor moon rpg	1
i try keep this brief ... way i'm only 10 hrs thru ... only just got out city #1 rabernastre , dalmasca now city #2 bahjerba ( sp ? ) : quickly , my first impressions game strange ... i like " meh i dunno if i want keep playing ... " but after maybe 20 min getting ' wierdness ' it really sucks you . ughh i really wish i didn't midterms coming up so i could go home play ! pros : - love battle system ! it still strategy but it doesn't require you random battles ... ughh i'd hate " whzzzhhh " starting random battles ... i still feel control but doing less actual work . - like everyone else says , cg always good . - story ... though not much character development/focus previous ones , i like whole war/polity centered plot . it follow fft tradition . - i actually like license board ... some people said it pain beginning , but so far it hasn't case me ... granted i very early game decide level up vaan bit ( ~ 40 min or so ) . you really just need know only use board when you really need ... don't randomly buy spots board just things become available its difficult one person learn everything . plan , plan , plan . ( right now way i'm constructing my chars way game hints ... its only one way it , but first time around i'll follow it ... already licensed equipment/abilities hint what they'll good . )- huge game . lots stuff see ... quite beautiful . - character design ... course there always someone love ... ( har har har ... fangirl i must say i love basch :d lol ... tho i love babyface earlier ff characters i think vaan too babyfaced . he looks like kid . -- haha i'm college student such fangirl ... haha ... sad isn't it ? -- if i guy , i'd say i'd like fran most ... this course subject personal opinion . )- i like subs i like how they not bland ... they fancy font this time :d . ( kinda reminds me nochnoi dozor . ) makes game really movie-ish . - widescreen capability ... ( looks sweet my widescreen pc monitor . )- course everyone always talks realism selling pelts what not ... i also like . - free-moving camera ... thank heaven . i love it . i hated still camera immensely ffx . - cute monsters ... lol love cactuar like monster rogue tomato ! - also love how you avoid some boss moves skillfully moving around them . cons : - huge game ... ( yes also con ) ... lots time running around . good thing all characters don't run painstakingly slow tidus ffx . meh ... neutral : - voices - i dunno what up people liking previous ff voice actors but anyhoo i thought this time there better ones . prev . ff voice actors okay but not great . here voice actors really good , but choice some them seems strange ... like i problem fran voice ... it strange choice strange voice . also balthier voice doesn't seem go his look , but i really like voice acting itself . ( sum , some voices , though really well acted , didn't seem fit actor look ... however , i favor good actors mismatched roles over okay actors well-matched roles so i give voice acting mild thumbs up . ) after reading review which mentioned mispronunciations , i feel i must also address ... someone who speaks some french i twitch when i heard " marquis " pronounced both " markus " " marquis " rather than " markee . " i also twitch when they pronounced " fete " " feet " rather than " feh-t . " - soundtrack - i liked all music ( there lot ) taken fft ... esp battle music estersand , i think it ... totally taken fft ( obviously both take place same world ) ... i enjoy non-midi renditions themes ... but rest new guy music just ' meh ' ... wasn't particularly bad , but it didn't really stand out much either	1
this game one ea best efforts outside sports genre recent years . it feels little like grand theft auto but also easy use format common ea games . while it violent , there no rewards killing pedestrians , doing so creates hassel your character . true mob form , you bribe police officers , but killing them isn't usually best alternative . weapon system this game great . you start out buying or picking up basic weapons beginning purchase more efficient accurate weapons later game . old stand-by shotguns , tommyguns , pistols , dynamite , even bombs all available purchase . if you into character development , this " sandbox " game you . it allows you gain experience ( respect ) you use upgrade any 10 different skills . if you fan classic movie , you probably won't dissappointed either . while game takes place parallel action film , it fairly well even though micheal looks nothing like pachino , other major characters all show up . james cann plays sonny gusto makes cutscenes pretty entertaining . customization great too , those tired playing one gta characters you forced those games . you change appearence , clothing , body type , among other things . gameplay solid , shooting system far more rewarding than most third person shooters . game took me 25 hours beat medium difficulty 10 get all unlockables . trust me , this great game pretty good replay value .	1
this game just so intresting game play . loving disney characters fanatic final fantasy series especially ff7 . seeing cloud this game sooooooo .......... cool . playing sora , you travel through worlds disney characters . sure fighting may gotten little annoying but you quickly forget it once you your way new world you go . overall , graphics sweet , storyline even better , voices intresting atmosphere really made this great game should all gaming collections . highly recommended :	1
when this game first came out i bought it . i very into game . back then thats when there just ps1 . but i never finished game . my original game all scratched up so i bought new one . now just ps2 . i got game but my ps2 seems not read disc . i dont know why . it only work people who still their ps1 ? i thought ps2 suppose read ps1 games well ? thing also . my brother bought game too it still didnt read it my ps2 . so any help would appreciated , cause i want play this again ! thanks	1
this game our gamecube , so addicting then , now we it our ds it just much fun . only downside it it confusing how unlock all stuff . you get certain rating i believe , like a-d , nonetheless it great game , worth money ! if you kids , kids thoroughly enjoy	1
my daughter , age 8 , love game !!! after school when we go out car she playing it	1
i got shrek 2 couple christmases ( right ? ) ago , i gotta say it alright . pros it up four players ( so if dad wants spend " quality " time junior ) , it wide variety fun characters , plenty levels . however , it lacks graphics , young children might not well during game . but overall its alrightgraphics : c/ it must released early , cuz it pretty badsound : b+/ crisp sounds . sound really matches mood . controls : a-/ changing controlling characters ' breezegood children adults	1
shrek 2 amazingly funny movie , all wit graphic animation first . game shrek 2 obviously geared towards kids , but great fun too . game lets you one four characters - shrek , fiona , donkey gingerbread man . each character his or her strengths weaknesses , graphics rather nicely . shrek lands hard thud , fiona floats gently ground , so . you play multi-player , or solo , easily switching characters if you wish . this great family play , where parents hop help out difficult puzzle , or just wander behind child there case trouble . most game collecting items solving simple puzzles . you slam snails get them out their shells get eyeballs . you slow down time so you gather up fairies . all , there fun jokes riddles keep you entertained . not all games high brainpower puzzles or super-fast lightning reflex challenges . sometimes it nice simple game kids really enjoy . i'm really pleased this game out there . highly recommended younger set , parents might actually enjoy playing tykes	1
this game fun play but not greatest game either . course movie way better than game . game pretty easy short considering there 18 levels . storyline beginning could alittle better well . some missions pretty hard but after you pass tough ones it just gets easy again . all all it good game . i would recommend it . graphics good , i like how they put some storyline movie . it not bad game play .	1
i loved original lego star wars game . it incredibly fun , very replayable wicked sense humor . lego star wars ii just fun , covers episodes iv-vi!it very rare find game kids play , adults play , everybody truly loves it . this one those games . i'm sure kids enjoy game quite lot - but pretty much every adult gamer i know loves this series well . it fun , it classic scenes star wars movies very funny style , you keep replaying it . you play it friends ! you unlock new episodes , new ships , new characters , you name it . first thing you notice when you enter " cantina " now you make new characters !!! yes , you mix up darth vader head , princess leia torso stormtrooper pants . you mix pretty much any character you find game , give them personalized names ! then you bring 2 your creations into game you free play mode . talk fun !! game gets even better . yes , you work through all classic scenes - luke buying droids , death star blowing up , so " first 3 movies " ( release order least ) . cut scenes very funny . able play various characters amazingly fun story mode , even better " free play " when you randomly switch variety characters find all hidden items . i love stud finding system . you want more money ? just replay mission few times . you get all sorts fun " cheats " ( not cheats , really , but fun add-ons ) , you buy new characters use , much more . it really gives you incentive keep playing . youngster house trouble playing ? just adult pop into game while help out , then adult pop out again , let child keep playing ! it just brilliant . i love this game . graphics superb , last time , little lego movements seeming just right . their swaggers sliders incredibly funny . sound , course , real movie soundtrack superb . you couldn't ask anything better . even tiny touches funny . if c-3po starts getting hit , he loses arm , then arm , then leg . you him hopping valiantly behind you , trying remain your team . chewie rips off arms stormtroopers . now course , there always few things game designers get wrong . while chewie arm-ripping quite funny , it really annoying when he it - very slowly - middle firefight when you wanted him blasting away . characters automatically switch into close combat mode if they think someone nearby , even if you really needed fire away someone blaster . even more annoying , if you're blasting away " destructables " ( wall items , whatever ) your friend gets near you start bashing him ! camera also really annoying . you get * slight * amount view control , but not much . when you craning around trying find mini-kit screen camera keeps swooping wildly exactly where you not want look , it get very frustrating . still , these minor problems game so stellar . i highly , highly recommend this game any gamer any age . it incredibly fun	1
i've never played real time strategy games before because i primarily play rpg . this game combines best elements both i've enjoyed playing it immensly . i look forward playing part 2 after completing it couple more times different characters	1
i old skool ds , it ok . when they released lite , i skeptical it . it right after microsoft 360 scandal , i critical new technology . i wanted wait until it out few months pick one up , see if it any glitches . i'm glad i waited , because they released coral pink one ! i picked it up first day , it so adorable perfect . ability change light levels great , old ds hard play outside because you couldn't really adjust lighted screen . it soft pink color , glossy , tiny . i marveled it size compared old ds . it super hot . charger old ds not fit into ds lite , so if you old charger/old car charger it won't work . :( that not such big deal since it comes charger , but i kinda sad old car charger wouldn't fit . stylus better , soft rubber tip instead hard plastic one old ds . colors it amazing ! sound pretty loud , i find i don't it up very much hear it fine . i'm glad nintendo finally realized not every gamer d00d .	1
right , just so everyone knows , i never played this game , however , i think you should read this . i bought fable , found my computers graphics card not compatible it . it good enough but not supported , so avoid this i suggest checking support section website before you buy check your card compatible . they actually put list cards site , i assume this problem not uncommon so i advise you check this before buying game . just thought you should know	1
good : * gameplay - overall , combinations enemies vs weapons/spells well . you buy every weapon , go back easier parts see how each weapon " fights " . you light/heavy short/long different damage . you also option using different spells . this those like me who want prolong game . i can't block/roll ( .. physically disabled ) , so i go " best defense good offense " strategy . you many options how win = you thus make game more difficult or easy based your decisions . * weapons - many choices . light/heavy ; short/long ; low damage/high damage ; augmentstions etc ... you try differnet weapons out per whatever part game ; if you want proplong adventure :-) . some weapons just plain look cool ! * spells - well , i my favorites , but tried them all . some work much better than others vs certain enemies . you pick choose !. i believe you beat game only 3 , but i used my favorite 6 = spice things up . * story - well thought out . * battles - many major fights * xp/gem runs - i think 3 spots where you increase these important categories . nice when added game ! * bugs - only few desktop crashes ; xp/sp2all all , you not overwhelmed too many options . just get there fight :-) bad : * voiceovers - sounded like 1-2 people all voices * women/villagers - basically same model * romance - well , one giggles talk ; other actually seems enjoy you . third option wife special npc seems reading poor romance novel . ok , you hit esc button ? if they wanted go down this path , designers should put more variety/work into this option . why no romance whisper ... would fit story + changed same-nesswhy no romamce briar rose - above . why no romance bordello lady - same above . wouldn't fit story , but changed same-ness . if you decide give them refuge , shouldn't ladies talk you ; open romance ? they just stood there posed . why can't i buy clothes my wives ... could buy dress myself * maps - i liked trek guild oakvale : much fight . i would go back forth several times . hoped run into nymphs :-) seems once you get knothole glade , you really don't feel need go roaming look something fight/do . ok , you arena ; lots fun here = unless you hero save , you it once . hook coast - just part/path final showdownsnowspire - well , it it if you last soul . what point talking villagers ; getting married etc , you spent no time these places . there could cave or forrest or swamp ; or combination give one something while these villages . seems final 1/3 game just " rushed upon you " ... you feel like ; " might well just keep questing " get this over . i would liked slow down , wander around ; etc ... if you didn't equipment/spells now , you won't get them coming hook coast/snowspire . all i remember value would some xp or " boosting potions " . if they just quest driven locals , then only map would needed = i saw no reason get wife ; buy anything this point * hero save - ok if you want xp/key runs . i've heard crashing problems if you over it . but , those longer/tougher quests , you really want redo several hours if you die or want stop ? i'm my 6th replay = 240hrsso , i obviously like this game . just i see room improvement adding or subtracting = taking middle , i feel designers weakend overall experiencebtw , fable 2 works ( ... xbox ) = i hope they don't go crazy system requirements once it comes pc . afterall , how much better game look = fable tlc " easy eyes " !. i found myself just wandering looking first few plays	1
i finished original " halo " game x-box , i found myself completely unimpressed . much hype this game found upon its release , i thought it could more depth it . characters , story , fight sequences , weaponry all seemed stale . once you passed first level , you pretty much saw everything there could see game . it became repetitive over time ending left you feverish more . it not deserve " cult " -like status it received . hesitantly , i began playing sequel hopes i could continue trash this series nothing more than premature over-hype fanboys didn't grow up " goldeneye " generation . outstandingly , this sequel impressed me . let me state again , this sequel far , least 100% better than original , so much fact , i found myself asking why this wasn't first series . it drew me continuous play engaging characters , extremely strong story , voices made you proud fighting either master chief or one downtrodden covenant . " halo 2 " takes huge steps forward nearly every facet original . after playing " halo 2 " , original seems like modified version pong . begin , weaponry outstanding . one major complaints i original arsenal weapons seemed minimal best , leaving whole world new weapons unopened . well , this game , these worlds opened fully explored . there so many new detailed weapons this game ; i trouble finding my favorite . thankfully , team bungie understood i couldn't pick just one , finally encouraged master chief use two weapons once . that right boys ; we double-fist needler like it going out business . this small change created so much more enjoyment me because i could really wreak havoc around corner ... there plenty havoc reek . this sequel not just gave you game where you could sit back create explosions any given time , but also developed structured story amazing cut-sequences transformed world " halo " into more than just one-dimensional game . while " halo 2 " boasts shorter play time , what appealed me depth characters spectrum what happening earth during this apparent " war " . original game , i felt my sole purpose destroy ... destroy ... destroy without any questions or answers . not case here , where missions seem intense , purpose forthright , unknown lurks deeper than imagined . there places we traveled this game i didn't think existed " halo " playing field . my eyes , bungie took small somewhat simple game , grew playing field immensely . detail focused graphics intense , introduction this " supernatural " world exciting , deception evil made me push further more than i original . this sequel game you could turn volume up your surround system fully enjoy explosions , swooping incoming enemy ships , well appropriately placed voice moments . anyone loves hear illustrious voice david cross yelling quips quandaries you you destroy any elite , than this perfect game you ! it just felt like more icing already sweet cake . weapons , voices , compelling story ... this exactly what i expected original game , but alas , not see it . if this original release game than i would see hype surrounding it , " halo 2 " nearly flawless clear images , veracity a.i. , well compelling detailed storyline . why couldn't you steal vehicle enemy original ? i experienced enjoyment this game i made it next level unlike original where i knew it just going similar fight aged weapons . this sequel compelled me move forward into deeper unknown . but , again ... it wasn't perfect . while i attest everyone " halo 2 " million times better than pathetic original , there still some small issues need addressed . ending horrid . person not , nor he plan get this time infamous 360 , i left open-ended ending really questions your loyalty finale . same issue happened first game ... so much dedication integrity meat game , why not dedicate spectacular ending ? choice armor master chief seemed weaker than original . i dare not run into fight this time , but instead make me think my attacks . bit annoying when you wanted just run suicide mission . i also hated fact you could not throw grenades when you dual wielding your weapons . master chief strong man/machine ... i strongly believe he could both , which put me into some tougher situations sometimes . finally , why there timed limit arbiter remain cloaked ? these may seem like small things big gamer , but me , they could strengthened create tighter game . overall , i cannot speak higher this sequel . those yell original always better than any sequels , then i would say " halo 2 " exception . bungie took opportunity grow this empire give us view this " war " dual angle , making universal terror greater more relevant . i enjoyed this game beginning struggled ending , all excitement enjoyment i hoping original . i highly suggest this game those unimpressed first , somewhat look forward what trilogy encounter ( if we get it without 360 ) . grade : **** out *****	1
i staunch final fantasy fan years . while waiting newest release , which kept pushed back , i tried out xenosaga . let me tell you , i am grateful i ! this game one most entertaining interesting games i ever played . world absolutely amazing characters unique , not mention plot profound depth . you fall love .... trust me . if you looking rpg draw you keep you playing hours , it xenosaga	1
war erupted humans alien life force known gnosis . man danger if nothing soon . that where shion uzuki , designer anti-gnosis weapons system known kos-mos , comes . this game splendid opening , it really gets you thinking life itself ( subtitle also book written philospher ) . anyway , you start out space ship creating ultimate weapon against gnosis . however , before completion gnosis attack your ship kos-mos starts herself up herself . then , your basically thrown around different areas , exploring multiple storylines trying figure out why everything happening . graphics this game similar anime game . characters big googly eyes look little cartoonish ( especially shion ) . that what really sets mood game , though . battle system really unique unlike any i tried . basically you physical or ether ( like magic ) attacks . if you choose guard during turn ap gauge go up , allowing you extra , more powerful combo . once you level up lot , you'll gain more these powerful end moves allow you defeat stronger enemies . you're not limited just characters , you also agws units , which basically mechs . i really not disappointed this game , i loved it better than any rpg ( yes , even ffvii ) . this great game ps2 collection , i would highly recommend it	1
there only two reasons get this xbox live subscription card . first , gift someone who already xbox live wants renew his subscription . second , normal yearly fee $50 , so if you get this card cheaper than , you'll save money . this card not good way get xbox live if you don't already it . purpose , buy starter kit ( asin b000209v8k ) , which includes free game , headset , year subscription . without headset , xbox live pretty boring	1
this game great , it definitely beats out simcity4 almost every department . graphics nice , social subcultures nice , game great overall . i only miss region overview , but i'm pretty sure if they copied many elements then ea would pretty good grounds lawsuit/cease desist order . now onto reason i rated this game one overall : i just paid price full game so i could starforce installed my computer . just other day i deleting starforce because it came game mine . this form copy-protection nothing short malware , i've already one dual-layer lightscribe dvd drive reduced worthless piece scrap metal thanks it . i'm getting tired find cracks starforce games i buy legally just avoid severe hardware damage ... point where i've decided i'm not going buy starforce protected products anymore	1

this fun game , only thig i say i wish ps2 or sony could web site where you download current rosters , next seasons games . it kinda sucks , if i want play next season i guess i go out buy madden 2007 updated rosters	1

not quite programming-sound sands time ( sot ) but thankfully far removed warrior within ( ww ) , two thrones ( tt ) arguably most enjoyable three next generation titles . visually , tt masterpiece . advancing upon beautiful artwork first two offerings , tt presents gaming environment gamer truly grasp his/her eyes around . lighting , facial expressions , body language , even pottery specifics all drawn perfection . audio sync these strengths ; music terrific , sound effects digitally crisp ( step your first dinner plate or pot get sense this ) . moreover , gone most blind jumps ww , camera glitches sot . characters themselves weapons they carry likewise individualistic works art . ubisoft montreal obviously thought this one through ( flaws previous two entries ) when creating visuals . control scheme similarly quite polished . sot still lays claim tightest all 3 , but tt close behind . perhaps by-product visual environment truly interactive . stealth mode blast perfectly fused into game dynamics . pure gaming perspective , absolute genius . dark prince hoot play + wonderful change pace , challenges face you suitable gaming stage you encounter them . unlike ww , secondary weapons now key elements gameplay . weapons racks appropriately placed provide weapons edge when needed . finally , puzzles , while ocassionally more frustrating than fun , conquered . prince persia veteran most likely not require faq ( stalwart ww , unfortunately ) conquer tt . newbie require moderate-high learning curve . this game , however , not without flaws . several reviewers refer frustrating encounters game ( second chariot + boss battle follows most obvious ) require dual save points sufficient sands time stored well advance proceed past . not mention glitch might require restart entire game . ( ugh . ) these by-products second rushed title , expedited keep gamers interested after poor ww . someone who played every prince persia title since its first offering , tt nice return its roots . new gamers -- alluded above -- i highly recommend playing out entire sands time series its release order . tt both make lot more sense while seeming more intuitive result . not mention storyline keeps you glued ' just one more save point!'highly recommended . fascinating discover what where next prince persia appear .	1
end " sands time " trilogy marks successful return style fun prince persia - sands time . two thrones combines good fighting mechanics warrior within ( ww ) downright utter enjoyment sands time ( sot ) started two years ago . story picks up where ww left off , prince returning home babylon . before you know it , sands time make comeback prince left peril order save his kingdom . all great platforming tasks insane jumps crazy obstacles here , most " sand powers " found first two iterations . gameplay same most part . new " speed kill " system quite fun , but some may find it eases fighting difficulty quite bit . said , its not always easiest thing pull off , especially when multiple enemies involved , but cool addition none less . graphics look better than ever , slight improvement over ww , remarkable improvement over sot which jaw dropping only two years ago . rendered cut-scenes look good sound clear , including all voice acting where original actor sot returned voice prince . he great job again really adds overall quality game . music return orchestral sounds eastern decent , hard rock left building much acclaim . this game very linear , which some people may stray away . there no multiple back tracking like ww . however it enjoyable start finish . even new chariot races interesting , but some may find them slightly out place . there one boss fight in-particular cause many frustrating moments all . after few times ( or perhaps dozens ) studying patterns getting your attack down , it becomes no problem . i experience one glitch caused my game freeze certain point several times . after searching around message boards , it seems common problem . i able get past it after resaving over save point file . word advice - least few different save files journey so you don't start over anytime . ending completely appropriate trilogy , leaves you hoping prince one day return . this game little short side . around 7-8 hours me complete , it seemed shorter than previous two . all all , great game . must play anyone who enjoyed previous two , or fans third-person action adventure . you owe it yourself play first two beforehand though , if only see story beginning end , experience one epic adventure	1
i actually bought this use my intel mac mini because it cheapest usb mic i could find . wasn't 100% sure it would work but it , price i'd say it performs excellent	1
i am so glad i purchased logitech mic ps2 . quality sound awesome , my kids blast it . price reasonable . my kids take very good care things , but i'm not so sure it could withstand any mistreatment . i probably end up buying one	1
i just recently bought this game $10 dollars . i always heard awsome but never even played xbox(i've ps2 fan while ) . after i played first couple levels i not dissapointed . this game simply amazing even today , i can't possibly imagine how good it must seemed back when it came out . gameplay terrific , so graphics . sound music game awsome . i highly recommend this game bought not just rented because it well worth owning	1
sure , graphics most significant update since tekken 2 . namco very careful keep gameplay mechanics perfectly tact . however , tekken 5 bgm tracks didn't seem keep pace innovation . few good songs here there , but overall , not cohesive ost .	1
well , list games below so i'm not going go through it . commodore 64/128 child i played these games their day . i console collection so i loved video games since i child . how many levels full games you could fit just 64k memory 350k disks back then . anyway , this collection some most beloved games era , least ones they could license use it . epyx games some best their time , games like impossible mission fun solve finish they not easy solve either . jumpman , international karate epyx games test your reflexes abilities perform exact moves joystick commands get higher scores . i fun playing this little piece gaming history , games not only flashy graphics ( though they make difference ) but how much fun you get game . when i kid , i used dream days i could see graphics games like ones we see today . these units hacked if you wish take flash drives more games , change game list or even add joysticks keyboards but that something you search know how . few programmers technicians who worked commodore computers back then found out how this even provide instructions how perform these modifications if you're skillful enough . i really like this product part my collection now , games not emulated c64 motherboard reengineered shrunk size small chip so you're playing games 100% reproduction accuracy , i wish i could give it whole five stars but i'll give it four because joystick could bit more responsive or perhaps like user mentioned it could i first version perhaps this addressed new version . overall , great fun product	1
monster cables superior construction always deliver best quality sound video . they cost little more but i found mine amazon cheap got free shipping . saved $20 over retail got shipment within 3 days . i'm happy	1
you use action relpay ur xbox multiplayergames , like halo2 u use codes their make it so you get unlimited ammo , because only reason why i want use this product so i unlimited ammo not reload . i would want invinsibility but then it would obvious i cheatin , when u read u probablly thought , well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt reload doesnt run out ammo . but still i would like know this before i buy it . i probably end up buying it anyways see wut this pup	1
ok , so far reviews really harsh this game . some user gave game real cheap shot just because monkey target isn't good gamecube one . admittedly , it isn't . i loved played gamecube monkey target hours , but this one just isn't up par . ok , that upsetting , but it easily overlooked . reason that case , fact rest game amazing . there few mini games tad boring , but most them blast . then there large selection mini-games just good monkey target gamecube , some . saying heck lot . new controls make fresh enjoyable experience , whether main game or mini-game . this game if you want see just what wii capable . controller used every which way show just how fun this new control mechanism . oh , btw , if you want see just how responsive enjoyable fps wii , one mini-games show you just . don't listen harsh reviewers , this keeper , great game .... especially other people play it . other words , super monkey ball banana " blast , " it wouldn't possible without amazing system , thanks wii	1

this present my brother so i don't know what it like , but he said " it best 3rd person game x-box	1
i am very hooked this controller . first i thought idea wire less controller just more hassle , but i'm completely convinced now . mainly cause it stops my biggest fear happening ; someone pulling my console down . this didn't happen first xbox because quick-disconnect ; but it happened quite few times my ps2 i would die if my 360 fell . also this feels more like remote now instead just game controller , making it easy go through your system dark know your no gonna trip if you get up . finally , i owned almost every console nes this far best controller i used . just buy it already	1
this first wireless controller i ever used didn't lag constantly . fact mine never lagged not even when batteries low . range more than enough any room my home . actually i taken it outside online mathces kept chatting other players so it even works through doors windows . great product i now two them retired wired controller	1
when ever i go lan parties , everyone there prefers this controller . theres only one person who used bulky , original , " duke " controller . when he , it often dissconnects him no reason . controller lot better my perspective . its what i've always used what majority population uses . they should just call it xbox controller , without suffix	1
simply put , this great product , if it doesnt work your ps2 , its because you " old " one . doesnt make this bad product . i own own(and slim ps2 ) it works just fine . better than all reviews i've seen claim	1
nintendo gc/gb advance cable adds some new features some its systems ' most popular games . although i not own every game this item enhances , i own few . what i played ( animal crossing , pokemon , harvest moon , ect ) this product provided just little more fun . although it not gaming essential , die-hard nintendo fans both portable non-portable systems definitely want buy this item explore new options provided cable .	1
i've dvd players come go , so its kinda cool gaming console plays dvd too . yeah , i know ps2 capability without remote , i one those too . but one cool things i noticed box playback kit remote looks just like ones made rca . i tried few controls dvd funtion my rca universal remote , low behold it worked . kinda hand thing , i've got many remotes floting around it , so part nice . mine works great , i use it instead re-arrange my already overpacked entertainment center put my other dvd player .	1
i love this game . once i started playing i couldn't stop . my ds battery dead after like 3 days i play so much . once you get into game it really hard stop playing . you get new moves new weapons thus making game new all time . controls easy learn story easy get into . so lets all tip our hats nintendo all there mario greatness	1
greatest star wars game ever . period . i got this game day it came out , i still can't stop playing it . this game everything original one didn't . new levels awesome , heroes great . oh , it helps heroes aren't immortal anymore like battlefront 1 . unfortunately , some best levels 1 missing 2 , such bespin tatooine . but if you xbox live , you get them + 2 heroes just 4.99 . must all star wars fans gamers alike !!	1
you get different animals . it really cool game . i recommend it other kids buy . cheetah get shoot bow arrows	1
i've owned this game since 3 weeks after it first came out , i nothing but praise this masterpiece game . after two equally amazing sequels feature so much more than gta 3 , one would think my opinion this game diminished , but it hasn't . i still remember playing this game first time . i'd just sit my room hours staring my mouth hanging open , just taken back everything , such very fun missions , enormous environment , or fact i could just run around whatever i wanted whenever i wanted . fabulous part this game radio . surprisingly , alot these songs actually good . i've never heard any people who sing them , but stations like head radio flashback feature some surprisingly catchy tracks add additional lightness this already darkly humorous game . however , chatterbox probably best , which features ton dry , sarcastic , often hilarious humour . such enormous environment , one would give graphics bit recognition . obviously , their not perfect , there many games much better graphics than this game , but these graphics still pretty damn good . cars look really awesome , all characters , including pedestrians , surprisingly well detailed . however , main thing this game its fun . alot fun . there so much more you rather than just missions . you variety sub-missions , which include becoming taxi driver , law enforcer , ambulance driver , even firefighter , all which allow you earn bit money . guns also really cool , you alot fun them , especially weapons like grenades rocket launcher . thing note this particular game alot glitches , but they aren't evident . example , beginning game you see yourself robbing bank unidentified part some city . well , later , if you manage figure out irritating dodo plane ( that right , there flyable plane ) , you actually find section city . overall , this one best games playstation 2 . pretty much any person who isn't jaded when it comes video games just wants alot fun very long time should buy this game . there isn't much story , but who cares . this game kicks ass , any gamer should buy this . don't rent this game , just go buy it right now . you won't regret it , i promise . one thing note , however , it very violent there fair bit cursing . you also solicit prostitutes , if you drive quiet place , your car start bouncing ( just so parents know ) . mind , game still kicks alot ass .	1
success nintendo ds lite brought out so many new gamers whole new generation handheld gamers . yet , those who purchased original ds , any those set ac adapter call their own . however , newer editions , you'd tackle different way plug charge up your nintendo ds system . well , this ds lite ac adapter nintendo very convient easy install . although there one disadvantage this ac adapter . this one , you unfortunately can't use this original nintendo ds . still , if you choose adapter charge up your nintendo ds , i really recommend one nintendo over company . price : aconvience : aoverall :	1
first off eyetoy great game/peripheral . next it getting some new games , well it useable next gen console ps3 . third it usable webcam pc . fact , it fantastic webcam . only you need download . inf ( driver ) webcam . there tutorials out there . google it	1
first thing hits you video sequences . introduction videos play amazing detail both screens . game features typical battle control you would expect square . additionally , i am pleased report all game functions controlled without use stylus . if you need something pass time this holiday season beyond , pick up this game . note : after purchasing game , i just wanted post quick review , backing up everyone else opinion . thanks amazon ! pros : 1 ) soundtrack : joy listen . 2 ) graphics : most detailed graphics i seen ds since release . 3 ) challenging : forget finishing this title ten hours . if you move fast through game you die . cons : 1 ) challenging : some may find this unfair	1
well i've played this few hours since it just came yesterday but i'm already very impressed . graphics incredible , i didn't think ds capable such pretty 3-d zoom graphics . there 23 different job classes game ( ex . white wizard , knight , sage , etc . ) , which fans final fantasy tactics recognize . able shift jobs work towards more powerful ones melds best rpg tactics . other words , crazy awesome good . probably handheld game year , probably biggest rpg christmas season . ****	1
i've played lots different genres games , this one difficult classify , other than it great game . most games cycle through my library , but this one keeper . control simple natural , gameplay hypnotizing , music perfect . hopefully there " shadow colossus 2 " works ..	1
anyone who loves football everything it knows their also dark side game . where players take illegal drugs help out their game , where owners anything their team win . this game alot like any given sunday . remember win any cos	1
i play this my friends . we all grown men . we're so pathetic but we don't care . when we play , we randomize our characters cars . it really makes game interesting . it totally sucks when you get stuck some losers like wario petey piranha . all wario throw lame bomb never hits anyone , petey piranha head so big you can't see road front you . i prefer donkey kong toadstool . if those two characters ever come up me , game over dude . usually i'm champ but last time we played , ron won . but we'll see who takes it next time . anyways , go get this game . you'll get your money worth then some	1
there isn't whole lot i add other reviews , but i disagree when some say this game challenging . i bought this game week ago i've already beaten it . no guide , no internet walkthroughs , no cheats . honestly , that never case me any gta game i've played . heck , i'm still trying beat san andreas ( i play straight up no cheats or guides/helpers ) i've game over year now . ending kind cheesy too , but it still good game makes great pacifier until next gta comes out . $20 , you can't really go wrong anyway	1
all i say squaresoft out themselves . it truly masterpiece feast eyes . i lost it story , creativity , music , charcters . beautiful !	1
i played many nfs series . this one nfs hot pursuit 2 best . me , this game would not very playable regular gamepad . i purchased logitech force feedback pro wheel it makes all difference . precise control . game takes whole new level realism . you get much better feel how different cars react . game get progressively harder . getting blacklist easy , getting number 1 not . some milestones ridiculously hard , but it awesome when you finally get past them . i wish i bought black edition , but regular one good hours hours fun . i would say there decent level replay-ability it too	1
i fan this game ever since playing against my buddy my vacation colorado last year . whether you're interested pure speed competative racing , or taking your opponents out road rage ... it all fun ! addition , you just cause unbelievable mayhem crash mode .... where whole object cause much destruction possible . this game lasts long time ..... so you lot , it never gets boring ........ i mean , there like 50 cars trucks waiting you .. if you win them	1
addictive game , which kept me up well past midnight . if you enjoy maps , urban layout planning , patient strategic thinking , this game you . ( don't buy it if you action-and-adrenalin persuasion . ) it take plenty system resources . i own dell xps 3.2 ghz machine 1mb ram , there still few bells whistles beyond my reach ( it helps sophisticated video card , which i don't ) . campaign mode annoying ( they give you too little money get started , bad things start happening too quickly ) . however , sandbox ( scenario ) mode joy play . you use scenario editor fill your treasury brim before starting game , get rid all distracting " disasters " ( plagues , god wrath , etc . ) prevent you doing what really fun this game : building roman city . you specify everything : which goods produce ( finite but ample enough menu ) , which buildings erect , where place them , how quickly grow , how much export/import , how much store or consume , where place your plebeians , patricians , soldiers , etc . course , city run properly , there things you can't get away ( people eat , don't like living ugly neighborhoods , need access running water , so ) but these restrictions merely imply you ensure functionality aesthetics , which part fun . there several maps choose , you even build your own ( although here program shows its weakness : editor not all friendly when it comes map editing , lead crashes ; first time i tried it , i overdid myself reinstall whole program , so beware ) . key improvements i would recommend number ready-made locations offered : there too few ( only 3 , fact ) . all other locations destined campaign mode play , therefore not modifiable all , which pity .	1
pros : - exciting absorbing story line . - great gaming experience . cons : - some minor bugs . - single player game . - cannot replay more than few times	1
this nearly perfect product if it weren't two things ; 1 . black color unfortunately makes any fingerprints lid way too noticeable . 2 . one thing i don't like lite fact gba not fit this console . nintendo really should've fixed this . other than , combined m3player passkey , really your best choice	1
i just bought new nintendo ds lite onyx i love i t.t he last handheld gaming system i owned one first gameboys . since then i really didn't care handhelds . my cousin nintendo ds . i loved it so much i went out bought new improved ds lite . so what if it ten extra dollars . it worth it . i blown away graphics sound . i love how sleek compact it . i love handhelds again . i going vacation needed something . believe me it gave me whole lot . i can't put it down . if you buy this nintendo you love i t.t hanks	1
this game fun , especially if you twitch gamer who few anger issues ( me ) . game basically suped up duck hunt but i don't know why it so much fun . story mode great fun finished manner hours if you good , challenge mode very challenging , unlockable crisis mode probably most fun i ever sniping my entire life , top it all off , if you guncon ... you say multiplayer . also , if you aren't aquainted time crisis but other light gun games there one biiiiiig difference . instead desperately plugging everything moves preying you get it before it gets you , you hit one buttons guncon ( or release , depending your control style)and take cover behind object nearby . but every game ... there drawbacks . one , if you don't guncon don't money version w/ guncon then you play awkward blue reticle incredibly slow . if you larger tv then you cannot hit enemies sides ( least , i couldn't ) . you calibrate darn guncon every time you boot up game if you calibrate it wrong then you reset ps2 try again . graphics aren't best earth . storyline wierd hard follow ( but no where near bad kingdom hearts , sheesh !!! ) . there incredibly tedious hookup process . if you smaller tv ... let just say you gonna three inches away screen spot some enemies . plus multiplayer split screen tiny , very very tiny if you want play like arcade , you need ps2 serial link cable(from what i've seen you cannot link two ps2s via network adapter , sowwy ) two guncons , two tvs , two ps2s , two copies time crisis 3 . if you ain't got dough you ain't gonna go ! although it seems like bad outweighs good , there just something nailing terrorists right head stream lead just feels oh so good . this deserves definate 5 out 5	1
even though it costs most memory cards might seem over priced , this wonderful memory card . i don't huge collection gcn games because i prefer ps2 but i remember older model memory cards i delete old saves make room newer games . this memory card you most likely hold saves every game you own more space should left new games come ! only complaint i this memory card it only comes one color doesn't match any gamecubes market	1
this good game keeps you thinking . story line something terrible happened you end up able go back time change events therefore change outcome . you get go back different era such horse buggy era back modern day . there several endings well depending what you've . you end up playing it through several times experience different endings . plot story good game good pace because time issue . so you feel like you got stay your toes	1
yes , xbox best video game system i ever bought . i own , also , gamecube , me big mario fan ( sierously , who isnt ? ) . i've my xbox , oh , two years . but recently , it died . i'm not sure what went wrong . cords fine . i've even bought replacement cords , but it just wont come life . i thinking buying xbox 360 , until i read all bad reviews . apperently , 360 some kinks it . so , i plan buying xbox . if i you , i would purchase xbox , not 360 . ups : -great graphics . -sound = awesome . -game genre awesome ! -no need " memory cards " . -you use consol dvd player , music player ! downs : -controllers bit bulkish . -a bit faulty . obviously , more ups than downs !	1

we got this game free box corn chex . we thought , oh this fun since show cool . so we got home played it it so annoying ! there just like black screen before after question shows up black background . just , don't buy it if you want any fun	-1
i'd like give this game good review , but unless you read fine print , you may dissapointed i discover it doesn't work lcd televisions . it also incompatible rear projection plasma television sets	-1
no way change inputs your tv . dvd functions tv functions accessed alternatly pressing " tv " button but there no way tell which romote aligned . therefore when you press power button you no idea which you powering on/off , tv or xbox . if things couldn't get any dumber , if you press eject button while remote tv mode it doesn't work . eject button only designed work xbox yet it disabled when tv mode ? there also no option program receiver . many others mentioned , this remote looks nice but people who designed it must drunk . not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money garbage	-1
opening cutscene introduces you blinx cat , supporting cast particulars his upcoming adventures , i found myself trying wrap my brain around basic premise story . idea secret , off-world clan humanoid cat creatures , armed souped up vacuum cleaners , responsible development dispersal time itself every known plane existence map . it seems time , when compressed tightly enough transported said cats , takes form one five different brightly-colored shapes . if these crystals left out open too long without properly introduced flow things , they turn into monsters . i could go , because game certainly doesn't stop there , but i think you get point . i like think there fairly thick line drawn cartoony fantasy super-detailed realism . generally , lot physics environmental details taken granted realistic game , because they're almost exclusively set photorealistic , lifelike location . cartoons , other hand , generally don't worry themselves particulars primarily concerned delivering good time . how much fun would wile . coyote cartoons if every time lead character suffered grisly fate , it strictly obeyed laws gravity aerodynamics ? blinx tries straddle thick line delivering story that overly detail-centric environment that right out kid show . result tale comes off way , way out left field almost completely abstract . it focuses things would better left viewer imagination ignores importance good underlying story way . beneath needless discussions why there monsters world , how time compression works how cats actually responsible all we hold dear , actual plot almost laughably straightforward generic . there princess , evil pigs kidnapped her , it up you you only rescue her save her world . that it , no side-stories , no reasoning , no subplots - just straightforward rush point point . here i thought phrase " save princess " universally recognized ages-old cliche . now , i don't want it sound like i'm railing this game just because it got few more nitpicky details than its peers it reuses old phrase way back platformer handbook its sole driving factor . it also completely lacking character development , general storytelling ongoing inspiration . none characters blinx really establish themselves individuals , including lead character himself . you don't hate pig spaceship because he trying destroy world , you hate him because every time he shows up he tries steal your money . i honestly forgot there princess end game after level three , because she never mentioned game start its finish . i mean , very first super mario brothers least reminded you princess castle end every boss fight . i don't honestly think game really designed enjoyable so much it geared overly challenging . first level half set up standard " get know you " format , simplest enemies , most routine stage layouts plenty opportunities mess around your tools . shortly thereafter , you're thrown wolves . most part , level designs very short , more emphasis cheap hits than complexity true challenge . i noticed lot overlap stage layouts , whether it retracing your steps time time again or walking catwalk ( har har ) above beginning stage invariably plummeting back start point . you'll almost always know what needs , but actually accomplishing act real trick . i just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most this game really . if there bottomless pit nearby , ( chances very good there ) blinx find way force himself into it , regardless what you're hitting control pad . if there enemy two feet front you you hit attack button , he'll aim random switch other side room , rather than imminent threat . that not say entirety time sweeper totally without merit , because it bring few fresh ideas table , but most part those insights hampered their surroundings . ability control time , instance , time really fresh , interesting new play mechanic still stands out today , despite limited field imitators since emerged . you rewind few seconds catch enemy unaware or rebuild crumbling bridge , pause action take advantage frozen time , knock level into slow motion , etc . all while , blinx moving around real time . it great idea , but implementation painfully short underutilized . why can't i use two controls same time ? why don't more aspects stage encourage player experiment solve problems these powers ? why doesn't ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause , speed up or rewind when i use my time powers ? why their duration so brief , why can't i hold more than dozen uses time ? i mean , this could've really fantastic experience if time control aspect beefed up little further treated more than just auxiliary function otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer . controls , too , undeveloped , undertested nightmare . blinx himself often sluggish respond , especially when implementing his time controls . he difficulty making precise turn , whether midair or solid ground . he stops briefly celebrate when gaining item , which leaves him open constant enemy attacks . he routinely moves direction certain death , though pulled magnetic field , whether you've instructed him so or not . he'll occasionally refuse perform double jump , particularly when attempting difficult , precise leap across gaping chasm . i think it these controls most make blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating . glance , you'd imagine they'd fairly difficult screw up . you've got jump button , suction / fire button , time control button analog stick control movement . plus , there already long , established line three-dimensional platformers market years before title release , paving way ideal control experience . super mario 64 its issues , sure , but nothing like this , it trailblazer entire genre jump world 3d . it like they map leading them right treasure decided forge their own path anyway . i can't even say i'm impressed graphics showcased throughout time sweeper , either . exception lead character himsef , these some incredibly cheesy , preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished hurried , less purposeful than you'd imagine ( especially contrast blinx himself ) . particularly insulting large population simple blobs roam around levels , trying vain bump into you cause fatal injury . here finely detailed main character , such close attention paid his wardrobe even gloss his shoes obviously debated time time again , he pitted against set monsters could've sprung life directly out pages four-year-old sketchbook . despite featuring spoken dialog track , there no english voice acting . i couldn't pinpoint language , but my wife seems think it either french or some close variation it . it certainly didn't sound japanese . while this add touch personality title , it not every day you get chance hear cat shouting something language love , it all seemed really odd out place coming out my television . everyone vocal personalities so black-and-white , too , i feel like great chance establish some much-needed individuality amongst cast lost once again here . bad guys all same deep , gravelly , transparently evil tone , while good guys all bright , cheery , squeaky high-pitched like monkeys super monkey ball . it like parody games come before , but i won't give developers enough credit assume they doing it purpose . overall , blinx really just few promising concepts thrown together one package , strapped shell far-below-average third person platformer unleashed upon unsuspecting public . time its release , it still need lot polishing , some serious scrutiny behind closed doors re-evaluation just how far some these concepts half-hearted character designs could conceivably stretched without losing any quality . top , i really don't know which audience they targeting it . game ridiculously difficult , which betrays childlike demeanor surrounds it leads me believe it meant serious gamers out there , but so bright , kid-friendly annoyingly cutesy i can't imagine anyone demographic rushing out stores release day . number spontaneous controller hurls shot through roof during my time blinx , reaching near-marvel vs . capcom 2 levels its unashamed , excruciatingly cheap hits , especially later levels . i no idea how i acquired willpower finish level eigh t.t he game adequately lengthy , offers some replay value , hidden cat medals each stage eventually unlocking production sketches , promotional materials like . once you start hunting floating cat heads those super-tough later levels , though , you'll remember why you so happy finished them first place . unless you feel like pulling your hair out clumps ( i shaved my head after experience part cleansing process ) enjoy self-mutilation , i'd recommend you stay far away	-1
i used my remote all 8 times before it stopped working . even proprietary dongle inserted into controller slot you cannot control this thing controller , you must use remote control . when you take dongle out dvd , screen come up telling reinsert , so if either dongle or remote get slightly injured or malfunction , then you've just wasted thirty bucks . i feel quite ripped off . low cost dvds nowadays , it much better idea buy standalone imho , you get good progressive scan $30 or $40 , which comes out same price . side , it also extremely annoying you can't turn , or off device remote , you must go up box it yourself , especially annoying if you just want watch dvd your bed crash afterwards . all all value proposition offered this product very low considering similarly priced alternatives	-1

this game , simply put , not good . i got bored tears playing it , then ended up giving it away because it robbing useful space my desk . it slow-paced , predictable , not suspenseful all . fact , these characteristics probably why it so mainstream , even though it laughable comparison real first-person shooters , which way don't even belong consoles . owning this game means you average player . any true fps gamer knows what childish , pathetic garbage this , while rest just go hype . many successfully deceived themselves into thinking it worth anything all . it isn't	-1

i start off saying if you own 06 version , then dont bother updating , you may not notice many updates/upgrades . this awesome game ? yes , but it few holes even still ; 1 ) too much sacking your qb cpu . 2)the cpu run ball so darn often , it joke . 3)the game might strain your ps2 it loads so often , 4)if you want play all-madden level , you forced play qb vision , which we all know stinks ! basically , they tossed few more options so you play blocker or etc offense you more advanced defensive controls such match-ups , assignments , etc . also , franchise mode still really great superstar mode quite enjoyable well . what this game really good ? well , it safe say graphics quite good commentary solid once again . crispness passing great running game big part this years focus . it still really fun running qb strong arm , it easy way dominate game ! btw , new kicking scheme actually really easy after test it out time or two , now i am making 90% fg easily ! you fully tinker ai change all other settings well . rosters also accurate but personally , if you own madden 06 , wait 4-6 more weeks then buy this one $19 ps2 best game	1

i just finished hl2 xbox thought some my observations might helpful other prospective buyers . my review primarily concerned my struggle getting hl2 pc or xbox . i bought hl , hl opposing force hl blue shift pc when they came out thoroughly enjoyed them . due hl2 xbox price horror stories i'd read online use pc version hl2 , i decided go xbox version . i make right choice ? hl2 very good game $20 xbox version , represents excellent value money . great graphics , great sound engaging game play . however , i think hl1 pc better game than hl2 xbox . why ? first , original hl much more open ended there often more than one way something or get somewhere . hl2 , i found there only one way . second , controls hl1 better configurable . hl2 xbox , i found some controls really awkward difficult use . example , there air boat drive direction throttle same thumb stick . i assume throttle direction separate keys pc version ? third , when there lot going , example , several combine soldiers firing you , explosions fair bit scenery display , xbox slowed down almost halt ! it just couldn't cope amount processing . i never problem hl1 pc assume suitably equipped pc could cope hl2 just well . lastly , others mentioned you didn't go very far hl2 before you saw `loading ' screen . frequency which you saw this become distracting annoying after while . one plus hl2 there no weird psychedelic alternative dimension like there hl1 . remember all hopping floating platform floating platform plants light up when you went near them ? all nonsense gone away which relief ! reflection , most my gripes hl2 more xbox version rather than game itself . if i choose again , i'd buy hl2 pc certainly get any hl2 spin off games pc if they appear like they hl1 . if not , i'll wait hl3 which ending hl2 leaves open .	1

i always hear these things , mainly point it unrealistic , noone uses teamwork , people too preoccupied their stats , etc , etc . may true many public servers , though there quite few aren't filled morons , actually people who play teamlike fashion , complete their objective over killing off enemy time given . i am one those people who actually go objective . actually , i am admin server , if terrorist last , camping out round , then i slay him warn him stay task . onto point- many people claim this so unrealistic , it may true points like m249 slow shooter , very cumbersome , too good aim standing up , fact you die 2 shots toe awp- those all unrealistic points , but if you think it , how much fun would it unload 5 clips half killt he enemy ? * cough halo cough * yes , i just insulted halo , because enemies too damn strong , it drives me crazy , multiplayer so annoying you shoot enemy 3 shots sniper kill ... my final point there people who aren't just preoccupied their stats , there servers dedicated fun- yes , fun , counterstrike . they whole slew crazy maps , ways make it even more insane , things such . if you interested try custom map servers . all-in-all this game peak perfection- not even mentioning huge amounts customization involved this game , weapons player models	1

xenosaga : episode 3 ( also sprach zarathustra ) brings back magic episode 1 fixes vast majority problems occurred episode 2 . story here , rich complex ever , brought appropriate moving close shion company battle uncover deep-seated conspiracy unlike anything else they've ever encountered . fabric story itself , voice acting , cutscenes all truly superb - it remarkable makers namco/bandai managed pull all loose ends together make story finally make sense . boot , it pleasure watch listen -- who could ask more ? battle system , it finally regains its fun episode 3 . i simply wasn't fan episode 2 system , so return " basics " blessing my mind . characters still battle their unique ways , each his/her own customizable skills obtain , but long gone days ridiculously long battles against painfully weak enemies . here , both ground e.s. ( mech ) battles , your ability strengthen customize your party shines through you always rewarded your hard work . replay value moderate-to-high well , since your party consists all familiar players most game ; if you habit using same three or four people ( like me ; yay chaos ! ) , you always play through again different group . shops return this episode , making buying selling your merchandise once again possible . only thing lacking this game little more " extras/side quests " department , which this game only offers handful . while some these take longer than others , few more side quests would nice , particularly since this last series . i can't rave enough how impressed i this title . it rivals episode 1 every way possible , trilogy epic story outstrips other rpg competition without question . if you're looking fun battles , fantastic story , beautiful graphics , then look no further ; xenosaga : episode 3 you . i only hope someone changes their mind decides make one -- after this exceptional closing episode , it hard not wish game come future . very highly recommended . summary : story : a+cutscenes : agraphics/rendering : abattle/skill system : aextras/side quests : a-replay value : moderate-to-hig	1

i love this game i it snes it one my favorite	1
simply put , xenogears + xenosaga 1 absolute best storyline , best role playing experience ps2 date . i strongly believe xenosaga 2 best storyline any rpg i ever , ever played , including final fantasy 7 , xenogears , hundreds others . because rpgs strongly reliant storyline gameplay , i consider this pinnacle role playing ps2 . final fantasy comes close , star ocean , but terms storyline , this game beats them . however , i mark down few other minor flaws . this game highly niche game , only those who enjoy style , sci fi setting . it also very short ..... 20 hours if you play straight through ( no leveling up ) . maybe 38-42 hours if you take up side-quests want strong character . gameplay : first xenosaga highly relied cut scenes narrative . fact , i absolutely could not stand battle system . xenosaga episode 2 still relies heavily upon storytelling through hours cut scenes , but it fixes battle system . battle system , simply put , one most fun turn-based systems i ever experienced . while xenosaga episode 1 battle system seemed slow unwieldy , episode 2 fast paced , action packed , highly challenging battle system . you 3 characters screen just all times , these characters switched off manner much like ffx , but it costs turn this game , causing it more tactical . each turn you many options ; you attack ( more various attacks later ) , stock ( save turn next turn order get combo ) , use ether ( read : magic ) , or change your battle party . if you choose attack , there whole slew options here well . most importantly learning weak points enemy . every enemy , including bosses , certain attack combination most effective against them . when you attack , you press either square , which zone attack , triangle , which zone attack , or circle , which zone attack . certain characters also zone attack , but this only against flying opponents . you must expierament enemies order learn zones they weakest . sometimes , you may required ' stock ' turn order attack enemy its weak zone . " what advantage attacking weak zones ? " you ask . well , it allows large scale , damage pounding comboes absolutely essential this game . once you hit all enemy weak zones , you " break " them . this involves circle button . once character ' broken ' , they tossed into air , or attacked while prone ground . this add up tons damage if you plan your boosting right . boosting integral part combat system . pressing r1 button brings up 3 slot meter which sometimes empty , but it may feature character potraits some your characters . if you press r1 , then button ( square , triangle , or circle ) character potrait , they boost forward , immediately after acting unit taken its turn , this new character turn . enemies , however , take advantage all these systems well . if you not plan well , or randomly attack without comboes , enemy break you , boost ahead several times , easily destroy one your characters one short , brutal assault . countless times my entire party destroyed simple enemies should no problem , merely because i not plan ahead . you get very , very used seeing game over screen . plus side this difficulty you feel real exhiliration when you win , it great accomplishment . note even power levelling , it won't help you much some situations , believe me , i tried . finally , there ether . ether skills basically magic , if you know anything rpgs all , then you know basically what present here , healing ether skills , attack ether skills , nothing big . i forgot mention e.s. units . these basically mechs , called a.g.w.s. episode 1 . many points game involve you using these move around fight , now they independant battle system . it basically same one your characters screen , except you only one attack turn , no comboes or anything like . it just added piece fun already awesome game . there skill system place . after every battle you earn class pointss and/or skill points . these spent getting new ether skills , or new upgrades your characters make them more resilient when you equip them . every character same skill set , this minor flaw slightly brings down gameplay score , but not overall enjoyment least . finally , one other flaw gameplay there no weapons , no armor . both these rpg standard fare , it seems kind odd not either . this may just something developers decided not i disagree , but it still seems little odd . note this really not detract game any way . xenosaga 2 , they also opted add lot more puzzle solving than episode 1 . interesting thing these puzzles , while challenging , don't take away gameplay expierience all . fact , i found many very enjoyable . storyline this game simply incredible . but , keep mind it basically required you beaten xenosaga episode 1 if you want understand it all , or least acquainted story some manner . if you haven't played it , best way get bonus dvd came game , there probably some somewhere around , maybe even ebay , allows you see 4 hours cut scenes original . this substitute those who dont want spend 60-80 hours required xenosaga episode 1 beat it . anyway , i digress , xenosaga 2 storyline more space opera fun . often times i got very emotional , game tug your heartstrings . ending sequence game , spectacular event lasting 15 minutes , i seriously tears . this game you , storyline good . it also filled entrigue , betrayal , new discoveries , new secrets . it truly incredible . i seen certain reviews say storyline doesn't solve everything , it doesn't solve all mysteries . let me tell you something : it not supposed . xenosaga going 4-8 part series , storyline continuous . it makes no sense all story complete only episode ii . i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain it . graphics : graphics xenosaga 2 basically same they episode 1 . no real improvements all . they still great though , cut scenes gorgeous . my one real complaint here lip sync sometimes off ( problem just every rpg voice overs ) , some environments little dull . this made up environments simply breathtaking . sound : soundtrack xenosaga episode 2 godlike . opening theme battle music catchy japanese sounding tunes ring your head forever , this music incredible . voice acting also absolutely superb , i zero complaints , this rarity . sound effects also very appropriate , very well . value : game hurt value department only because its length . put it perspective , first playthrough took me 28 hours , but more like 30 if you count all times i died go back point i got killed . after you win , you use your game clear file access even more goodies like some bonus bosses , dungeons , side quests , this helps make up shorter length . personally , i think its best $50 i ever spen t.t ilt : finally , overall enjoyment . this game simply most enjoyable game i played ps2 . i completed it after several all-night gaming sessions , it most likely keep you up too . role playing experience here superb , storyline possibly best rpg history , battle system incredible depth . there virtually nothing not like . avid rpg gamer , i recommend this game highly possible . however , there few things consider : you handle challenge , you like space opera/anime feel ? if you answered yes both , get this game	1

i decided try this game because it listed similar game customers purchased other games i really like . i am fan longest journey , syberia , gabriel knight , broken sword , etc . etc . i wasn't expecting whole lot when i started keepsake , but i looking kill time because i love pc games . very start , i swept into story , setting , characters ( i love it when there fun mascot sharing your adventures ! ) . voice-overs some graphics really pretty unrefined , but also makes game more endearing . these factors could reasons this game not listed way up there some other titles i mention . i added it my list favorite games , i play games alot	1

i wanted this workout " game " get back into shape after baby . it great workout including cardio , combat , isolation abs , arms or legs , mind body including yoga tai chi-type exercises . i love it tells you what day work out ( if you don't you fail day ! ) it increases intensity workouts based your previous performance . there several different workouts each segment so each workout truely unique help prevent burnout . your workouts assigned letter grade based your performance so it motivates me get allusive " " , which hard achieve ( it should ! ) . i am week 8 12 week program i definintely feel my muscles more toned firm after not working out year . i love nike helped produce game . i recommend this game anyone ; however , i issues eyetoy camera . you would think i would get how camera works after 8 weeks but i still problems . sometimes it indicates i touched something i nowhere near , sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 tries it register i touched something . you're still getting workout , but i'm working towards getting good letter grade . i want credit what i'm doing right . combat exercises frustrating i hard time believing i'm not punching hard enough often receive 0 score . i've started working out night sunlight windows makes camera less responsive . there couple times i've walked left screen my body triggered " try again " button after cardio workout ... so i 10 minute workout again history shown when i try exit out it , game fails me day quitting . all all i'm happy workouts , but just know camera takes some getting used . i hope others better luck it than i . my husband 12 week program also he lost 10 pounds i've lost 9	1
after sixteen long years , final fantasy iii finally sees official release outside japan . however , unlike previous games , final fantasy iii completely reworked . this more than just port enhanced graphics . final fantasy iii includes some new secrets side quests addition its graphical overhaul . final fantasy iii may just enough please some hardcore fans , but wait really worth it ? well , yes , but game isn't perfect . storyline final fantasy iii entirely too simple . crystals losing their powers there only four warriors come forth save world falling into darkness . sixteen years ago this pretty standard story , but when compared your average rpg today , current final fantasy games , storyline final fantasy iii joke . there nothing this story screams epic , characters involved aren't developed very well . luckily , we let it slide because its sixteen years old . gameplay wise , final fantasy iii pretty similar most rpgs today . you'll go roaming through dungeons towns getting into random battles . there few quirks game ds utilizes . you'll find moments where you'll zoom into certain objects you examine . it should also noted you use touch screen almost exclusively game . using stylus you make your character run direction you want him , gliding it across screen . taping things makes your character examine it , ultimately this how you open chests talk people . it works out , but it feels really clumbsy times . if you're looking get through dungeon little hassle , just stick directional buttons . its credit , though , using stylus makes menu navigation much faster , but most part , stylus controls just feel tacked . combat traditional turn based combat . there no atb gauge like later final fantasy games . each round you choose all commands your characters , then watch round battle take place . it simple , but isn't always fun . mainly because final fantasy iii challenge . if you began some later final fantasy games , then this installment may little too difficult . sometimes combat unforgiving , especially when faced bosses attack twice per turn , power take out character single shot . even worse , encounter rate pretty high running away battle often wasted effort because you'll fail so many times trying so . you'll probably get wiped out just trying run battle failing so many times . there several moments when you'll forced battle hours just leveling up . this fine those used old school rpgs , but many rpgs today not put so much emphasis leveling up , it may try your patience after while . it great people looking challenge , least , but some it may bit too steep . job system interesting . you go through game you'll get crystal shards allow your characters use certain jobs . each job its own set abilities learned it . example , white mages specialize healing arts , black mages attack magic red mages little bit both . you've also got other classes like warriors who take damage other party members , thieves who steal much more . there 23 jobs all , possibilities nearly endless . jobs you choose your characters also impact your stats . mages , example , don't lot strength but they excel magic . also , you gain levels , you'll also gain job levels . so it not only important make sure your characters good level , but also good job level . game looks absolutely stunning , least nintendo ds . it far one best looking out there . there some moments where it looks pixilated , but you can't deny game just looks good regardless . movie sequences also really pretty look they run surprisingly well . battle also fantastic . your enemies sport some amazing detail so backgrounds battle . whole , game just looks good . perhaps only fault graphics how restricted animation characters enemies combat . your characters won't physically go up strike enemy . rather they just step forward swing . very similar how final fantasy games nes worked . it strange see , but you'll quickly get used it . thing seems kind strange , though , top screen throughout most game remains blank . all action takes place bottom screen . there few moments when top screen actually displays anything . you'll see world map you travel overworld while you're towns . there certain moments where top screen text , or shows important story sequence , but that usually it . other than , when trumping through dungeons ( you often ) battle ( you also often ) top screen remains blank . there nothing wrong it , but it feels very awkward play nintendo ds game where top screen blank . they could've used it display dungeon maps or enemy information or something . top screen no impact gameplay whatsoever . music game pretty good , though . it not good other games series , there some tunes just aren't great , but music no means bad . there no voice acting game , really , but we let slide . audio wise , game good . final fantasy iii pretty satisfying experience any final fantasy fan looking good challenge , see how far series come . however , it may also shed little too much its old school charm some areas , particularly its unforgiving challenge . still , it worth it final fantasy fans who want see just how far series come . good+finally chance play final fantasy iii+great visual look+good music+the job system interesting+it provides good challenge+a fair amount secrets sidequeststhe bad-the story not all great-for some game might provide too much challenge , point frustration-high random encounter rate-throughout most your adventure top screen just ... blank ... nintendo ds game this just feels awkwar	1

i bought 2 these controllers my kids , because i didn't want cables middle our family room nor i want them sitting too close tv when they played . this controllers excellent . they work perfectly , they easy store because lack cables , weight fine small children , range signal more than enough they aren't battery eaters . i use them well they wonderful . they much better than ones comes playstations	1
santa brought this game , i don't think we've stopped playing since ! it such blast , really brings family together . we all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum " brick house " ( it our last one left wasn't platinum ) other day . it great variety songs ... new old . reviewer said there weren't enough new songs , i disagree . my friends ' daughters ( 21 16 ) even commented how many new ones there ( but they still chose sing " take me " 80 . my 8-year-old my husband gotten perfect scores " material girl . " fact , my daughter loves all old 80 tunes . only problem we've this game arrows don't show up dancing . we don't mat , but we tried it someone else house . anyway , i'm sure we'll get squared away time we get mat . i cannot recommend this game enough ! don't get headset , regular mics better ... sure get two duets	1
i played through fable lost chapters several times . all all , this very fun game . classic rpg elements leveling up , buying or finding new better weapons armor , choosing focus magic use or hack slash , choosing good or evil all included fable . graphics superb its time , voice acting top notch . addition , storyline quite good , more complex than average rpg ' save world ' tale . i heard some complaints fable too short , but if you take all quests max out all levels , game length should just fine ( unless you expecting 50+ hours morrowind experience ) . where fable loses some points controller setup . button configuration overwhelmingly complex , so much so finding yourself using item you not mean use frequent occurance . addition , you may find yourself using magic inopportune time , simply because you pressed trigger mistake . bow aiming feature might pop bad time ( like when you attacked 4 creatures ) , while rotating camera view , map pop-up might fill your screen you midst battle ( thus obscuring your view ) . also , fable tend some save problems . you may complete some quests save , upon reloading , quests may recompleted , or worse , may not saved not offered again ! still , these rather minor complaints . while fable really doesn't live up its advertising all-immersive rpg , it quite good , blast play if you like dd styled rpg . if you like zelda games but wish they more adult , definitely check out fable	1
headset awesome . fits very snug your ear not irritate over time . crystal clear 2.4 ghz channel . 9 hours game time only takes most , 1.5 hours charge . gaming lot more fun !	1
this game out while . i playing it long time now . i ever boring moment while playing gta : sa ? no ... i honestly cherished every moment gameplay . why ? because this game so much content capability , it not possible dislike this game if you actually sat down play appreciate it . people giving gta : sa low ratings must joking . control - superb . when i want my character something , he it , no questions asked . if i want fire gun enemy , i get fire gun without put up errors or jams . if i want hop car take off , i get just . content : this game vast improvement over even gta iii . there so much , it impossible ever get bored . every second entertaining ... there always something work and/or improve . challenging missions everywhere ; if you don't want missions you go lift weights , build up your muscles ... or you go put some neat features/colors your personal cars . radio : good stations songs cover just any genre . graphics : course there always room make graphics better , but graphics this game very good , despite there so much disk . this game covers everything , there never really let-down . if you haven't bought/played this game , i suggest you . it worth every penny , keep you entertained accumulated weeks time . good luck	1
it great game featuring awesome engine , single player campaign really good , multiplayer ok , totally recomended	1
this great controller , it rumbles ( unlike wireless one ) . yeah , it wear down time , but it far one better controllers because it doesn't ruin your gamecube it more durable third-party ones ( aka those not liscenced nintendo ) . i first third-party gcn controller some reason , it stopped my gamecube reading discs . i get it repaired . if anything , if you want good controller , don't go third party stuff . go original like this , one : they last much longer two , they don't ruin your hardware . it may look plain , but it would better plain working controller rather than quickly defective pretty one . also , official wireless if good , if you don't mind lack rumble	1
when blinx first came out , all reviews didn't really know what make it . they said this one most innovative titles come out past few years , but then they started going how hard it how it gets repetitive you go through each stage , clearing enemies proceed . well , what game isn't repetitive ? you could just easily say " all you tetris line up blocks " or " all you mario 64 collect stars " . reading time controls sounded so confusing . i didn't think i'd able handle 10 minute time limit each level while controlling time . so just week ago , i got blinx couldn't wait see how it played after countless " love it or hate it " reviews numerous people . after watching cool little intro breezing through first 2 worlds night , i saw -nothing- wrong this game . only people much trouble this those who only play rpgs or sports games , don't give platformers try . time control nothing worry either , it very simple understand , actually , you don't use time controls often . main story blinx short point . which good because i'm really sick games spending 15 minutes intros just tell you " this what going " pointless fmv . blinx quick 3-5 minute intro showing you he part millions time sweepers , time custodians clean up any problems time different planets . but suddenly , something goes wrong one them , princess kidnapped . blinx sees her gets determined save her , planet . you go through 9 worlds ( each world except last , there 3 levels , one shop , boss end ) get her back . each level , you collect time crystals gain time powers sweep ( use your sweeper/vaccum cleaner ) garbage take out all enemies level proceed next . it actually very fun i never got tired it . sweeping up different objects deals different damage enemies . garbage or flower pot won't whole lot , but beat up jaloppy , piano or even 16 ton weight , now there real damage . time crystals all over place , you gain time power collecting 3 or 4 same type . getting 3 one kind 1 any other gets you one power , but getting 4 same time crystal gets you two power . powers you use rewind , fast forward , pause , record slow motion , hearts gain you retry . if you haven't figured it out other reviews yet , it kind obvious when you need use some powers . like if you see bridge fall down , use rewind watch it rebuild itself cross . if you can't walk up river that pushing you back , rewind it so you walk up ease . if there two switches you need activate , record yourself jumping one while you jump other open door(s ) . main ones you'll using though pause slow motion , mostly because these work anything , even bosses . yeah , people go how hard bosses ... i guess they didn't figure out how use time powers . but last boss ... oh man . guy took me least total 9 hours beat . i just beat him this morning 2:59:49 am ( yes , i got exact second ) flipped out . i proud myself . he up there pocky rocky snes last boss . it like developers got mad something put all difficulty into him . because rest game pretty easy until part . side note , i love how ice levels actually ice . not magical non-slippery ice they other games . here , you pretty much skate floor if you go too fast or hit wall , you fall over get back up . it small things like make me love this game even more . graphically , blinx stunning most part . remember 10 years ago when you saw screens donkey kong country impressed models ? that what i got here . blinx himself some best graphics i've ever seen . see how he looks box ? that exactly how he looks in-game . you see fur him when he up close , they got every single detail down perfectly . every level also just much detail , there no bare areas all . there always something going . course , i can't leave out water . everyone seems impressed no matter what they think actual game . try slowing down time running through river/canal . or pausing it see trail left behind . developers fantastic job . unfortunately , some enemies don't much detail blinx . lot them just one colored shapes didn't really require much effort create . but then there some really cool design . so it little mixed bag there . last boss man , i won't even start thing . there no slowdown unless you're blasting tons garbage enemies without stopping . only other slowdown when you make it happen . it appears run 30 frames second , there nothing wrong . i really enjoyed music too , would love get soundtrack . main theme if fun enjoyable , first level contains most magical music i've ever heard . rest game good music , always fitting mood setting . final boss music really puts you mood take ' em out , it full energy concentration . sound effects cartoony , but that not bad thing . when blasting garbage enemy , you get zany little effect sounds like something tom jerry . voices however , i'm confused . they're not bad . fact , blinx great delivery voice acting not much personality ( he platformer character . he doesn't need personality ) . but i could've sworn they spoke japanese beginning . i know fact i translated some words meaning what text screen meant . but end , i didn't understand single thing . i guess they made up their own language here just like they panzer dragoon orta . but there isn't lot language going , just belts blinx most time . though he say some things english once while . i noticed " yay ! " " burned kitty food ! " when he got knocked out into lava pit . keep ear out what pigs say when you hit them garbage whenever they show up level . i swear one you fight most time goes " you suck ! " when he gets hit . it pretty intimidating hear even if you're winning . blinx didn't disappoint me all . it tons replay too . you get rank when you complete level , if you get all a+ or s+ ranks , you get cool treat . plus there cat medals each level add little bonus clips . first few pretty lame , but you get more , they turn out great . going back figuring out new ways beat bosses always fun too . i just can't stress how much i love this game . my shelf , i put this above knights old republic jet set radio future . but right behind panzer dragoon orta . what i've heard , demo sequel ( i'm amazed this thing well enough get sequel ) even better . blinx 2 probably first xbox game i get full price when it comes out . so get this if you're looking little bit " old school " feel superb graphics quality ... course fun . that all matters games , fun	1
basically if you like 04 , 05 06 you like this game nothing but rankings really changed . its same commentary , gameplay few new graphics . i like it its lot fun . im glad they didnt change it . remember old saying if it aint broke dont fix it . this great game play close there you ge	1
this game enjoyable enough , but doesn't really hold my interest enough go back it . it lags bit my gamer pc , some minor errors , but all aside , it just wasn't interesting me . game good quality , may perfect other gamers , so it still worth good rating	1
there really not much say this kit , however i think it unfair it received such poor rating considering only other reviewer complaint , kit too expensive , inaccurate because one he suggests actually more expensive . however , this truly passport amazing gaming experience . xbox live experience truly something innovative relaly really fun , i would recommend buying xbox 360 despite next playstation nintendo stations coming out . however , i also recommend waiting til after christmas . rush get these now ridiculous , i seen some consoles sell over 800 dollars . why not wait til after christmas when there almost certain price drop enjoy what this xbox live pack offer	1
star wars : jedi knight ii - jedi outcast . third game star wars dark forces series . introduction : i've pretty much always fan star wars , you may guessed , i'm fan many games based series . although star wars games often hit miss , when one succeeds , it usually succeeds beautifully . one most interesting ideas star wars game dark forces , released playstation one pc . although game itself horrendous , terribly-choppy framerate very poor level design , it something world never seen before - star wars first-person shooter . sequel , jedi knight , cleaned up lot problems , added some new innovations . now third game series , jedi outcast , arrived . like previous games this sub-series , it gotten multi-console release . read see how it fares ! overview : jedi outcast star wars first-person shooter . game one-player quest , well several different multiplayer modes . review : put it simply , this game everything original dark forces should . while not perfect , this game huge improvement over its predecessors . once again you play role kyle katarn , agent other dark forces titles . second death star destroyed , but many imperial forces still fight , so it up you infiltrate their hideouts exterminate them . graphics , most part , solid . i impressed how good they this kind game . nothing state-of-the-art , but they're still pretty damn good . control also given overhaul rightfully so , since this game lets you use force powers wield lightsaber . single-player mode extremely entertaining , fact game offers multiplayer options only adds overall value package . you save whenever you want single-player mode ! but , course , game isn't perfect . like earlier dark forces games , level design just not good . too many areas look alike , there too many instant death spots just too easy fall into . likewise , many cases your objectives unclear , some puzzles pain - i don't know you , but i buy first-person shooters shoot people , not solve puzzles ! because imbalanced puzzles often poor level design , it took me over hour just beat first level ! huge problem availability . lack custom control configuration also plagues game . this huge problem , since game limited control selections often clash what you're used this sort game . this game wasn't released gamecube very high quanitites , so you're gonna shell out full new price just get used copy - my mind , it not worth price . sad but true . i recommend this game star wars fans , just warned it not perfect , it hard get copy . edition notes : this good game , but some strange reason it just wasn't available gamecube very long . because this , even used copies fetch close original new retail price . this extremely annoying people like me who want get every star wars game . still , you should hunt it down if you're into this sort thing . overall : overall this best game dark forces sub-series thusfar . where game succeeds , it succeeds beautifully . i am impressed game , it just shame gamecube version not made readily available all would-be players . i strongly recommend this game if you get hold it - i doubt it disappoint any star wars fan .	1

this game great . both missions things you your own ( like extortion ) make this game awesome part anyone collection . i only found one thing wrong game . when you reach rank " don " , everyone still talks you i you bottom barrel . instance , when talking one corleone men , they still say something like , " hey kid stay outta trouble " . this game , although great , still use little fine tuning .	1

i using basic linksys wireless game adapter my 360 , it worked fine . however , it needed connected pc firmware updates ( making it impossible mac users ) , generally more difficult set up than " official " adapter microsoft . i ended up getting this adapter sale , setting it up snap . it gets decent throughput , saves some energy over external adapter , because it only uses power when you xbox 360 . it also nice see this supports wpa networks . if your time valuable you , this probably worth extra few dollars over similar products . you just snap it , enter your network password , you're off .	1

my kids really like memory cards because they keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	1
i've counting down until i could get this release couldn't wait play all these great games again . when i got it started playing , it fun but disappointment kept mounting . little things like no manuals ( you open file and/or print them yourself ... not big deal itself , but come vivendi , quit so cheap ) no case cds ( you just get twopaper sleeves ) make package look incredibly cheap low quality . yes , these computer games 80s early 90s , but this package could put together better . graphics same originals , so i didn't expect any " update " there . i completed kq6 1 no problems , but kq5 annoying because you can't go back text ( or least , i haven't figured out how ) . " music " overpowers what characters saying . any problems you previous games , such difficult maneuvering , remain same , which expected . overall i guess my disappointment comes fact vivendi could made really nice package this , added some extras , beefed it up , included more information , stuff like . especially how long it took get this going . how many times release date pushed back ?? but no , it bare minimim cheapo production . i know it only $20 , but still ... could lot nicer . still must any kq fan tons fun play , but i am ultimately disappointed this product	1
i just got this game thursday i'm already disc 2 . this my first time ever playing final fantasy game i'm glad i picked number 9 . i won't spoil anything telling any story , but i tell you game amazing . graphics great there best i've ever seen ps1 game . i love characters , i'd say vivi my favorite then next would zidane , but really i love them all . playing final fantasy 9 made me wanna buy other games play them too . buy this game , you won't regret it .	1
i hesitated good while before picking this game up bargain price . based upon various reviews player feedback , i assumed this game would like 10 hours long , bit buggy , dumbed down . fortunately , none this case . i some good fun this over weekend ( yes , it finished over weekend ) didn't come across single bug . fable not same league morrowind , oblivion , gothic 2 , or some other great roleplaying games ( rpg ) out there , but it provide enjoyable diversion . gameplay : controls typical wasd keys mouse commands found most single-player rpgs . game fairly easy learn navigate . story traces hero childhood through adulthood , when he'll , you know , save world . there no character classes per se , but you roughly play warrior , magic-user , or stealth/archer character , or some mixture these . much story centers around main quest line , but there number side quests available . unlike most rpgs , quests assigned quest cards you pick up heroes guild ( lol ! that what it actually called ) . it rather artificial-feeling system , but it functional . progression game quite linear . most instances , you not able even leave beaten patch , since fences , rocks , invisible barriers won't allow it . compared more open-ended rpgs like elder scrolls series , fable seems restrictive light weight this regard . overall , it decent story , but it rather force-fed you . game includes several interesting touches . people react you based upon whether you've performed good or bad deeds . if you roleplay like saint , you'll eventually halo butterflies floating around . ladies ( guys ) worship you , you option buy home marry ( multiple times if you'd like ) . if you play evil character , you'll eventually grow horns fall out favor polite company . nonplayer characters game , least towns , jobs schedules . they work during day sleep night , though only quest-related characters anything say interest . although you only play game same guy , you customize him tattoos , facial hair , haircuts , ( small ) assortment armor . you control how your character skills develop , but not deeply you game like morrowind or baldur gate . there other small things you , such fish , play games chance , treasure hunt . overall , this game takes 20-25 hours everything it offer , so it rather short rpg . things i didn't much care not major , but simply underscore light-weight nature this particular game . game certainly designed appeal adolescent crowd , hotkeys burping , farting , so forth . various tattoo styles haircuts further highlight this point . there nothing really offensive game ; it just feels bit immature places . also , save system based mostly checkpoint model . you can't save just anywhere ( least your quest progress not save ) , but game autosave important junctures . graphics : game looks quite good . character models convincing ( though bit cartoonish often repeated ) , natural environment screenshot beautiful some places . since pathing fairly restrictive , much scenary noninteractive . it not like oblivion or gothic 2 , where if you see it then you probably travel it . sounds : voice acting pretty good , usual british accents invariably seem accompany such games . music particularly well appropriate various atmospheres . ambiant sounds also decent . replayability/technical issues : game probably worth playing twice : once good guy once bad guy . it play similarly either way , but there different ways perform certain quests depending your moral disposition . technically , game perfectly stable my computer -- no freezes , crashes , or other problems . manual decent explains much game , in-game tutorial . if you like rpg games get this one cheap , go it . it well-polished , though simple , rump through fairly well rendered world . don't expect same character depth , engrossing story , or exploring options you'll find some games i mentioned above . however , fable : lost chapters good several hours entertainment .	1
i purchased nintendo ds lite solely use it brain age big brain academy . i not used it play other games not intend so . i am still confident giving it 5 because keeping my brain active worth it . my wife also uses it daily . pros . - long battery life ( 8-12 hours what i seen ) , easy use , compact , possible use internet browser if card purchased ( i only seem them e-bay japan - mixed reviews ) con . - biggest complaint it not utilize built wifi not coming built internet browser , not really interested adding mp3 jpg files but i would like option so , more educational games line brain age or big brain academyoverall . - it worth $129 ds lite $19 brain age start using your brain again	1
if you liked original then you also like kh2 . it finishes story nicely . battle commands improved - i especially like reaction commands . still some camera issues . overall good game	1
i similar difficulties this hi-def adapter . one thing , plugs nearly impossible get into sockets . once i get them , all i got black screen . but thanks friend , i figured out what problem : if you're trouble getting those monster cables attached ( who hasn't ? ) , you should get deoxit progold kit caig . it just two very small cans stuff help clean off your connectors , more importantly , act temporary lubricant . i got my kit radio shack . i think it twelve bucks . not getting any picture all , my fault . i didn't realize two sets inputs my tv 1080i only . once i moved plugs proper jacks , turned off signals not apply my xbox dashboard , picture sharp brigh t.t he cables good quality . my only problem them proprietary digital audio connector . it kind lame monster require you buy their special optical cable comes right adapter . other than , if you've got cash , get these cables , caig kit	1
call duty best game you get wii its launch titles . except zelda tp , course . story line incredibly well developed you lead ally forces their liberation france . game utilizes all aspects systems capabilities you use unique motion sensing capabilities drive jeep , plant charges , aim mortor , even fire your own weapon . graphics not quite comparable those ps3 or 360 , but it never becomes issure . this game incredibly fun i would strongly reccomend it anyone	1
i rarely rate or write reviews video games , cds , or movies ... but i feel this game deserves all props it get . honestly when i first saw ad it i thought it looked interesting but none my friends or family heard it , so i reluctant buy first . however , my roomate i decided buy this game play it through together , it ended up even better than my favorite final fantasy video game series . sotc unique story line , decent music , but most all most beautiful innovative gameplay i encountered . idea just fighting giant creatures throughout free roaming world amazing , able climb up them use terrain best your advantage . no " trash mobs " each colossus relief too , because i feel though it would made game more cliche unenjoyable . i could talk all day this , but sake listening me rant ... go buy this gam	1
i think it great game , you play online other people around world . it good your're able play online , because after awhile easy level , gets boring . there different levels keep your intrest . campains really awsom . they never become boreing . mythology it real . this game real high , easily gets addictive . days fun .	1

why it 3rd party memory cards store least double information these ? these memory cards way over priced . i love ps2 . it one best systems i ever played owned , but this memory card stuff scam . i already own 2 cards i need more .	-1

first game we played gamecube spongebob , battle bikini bottom . we absolutely loved it my daughter plays it over over . thinking shrek 2 would similar , we rented it . it very hard control c-stick it kept zooming out wouldn't rotate camera except certain times . charactors very distant even if we used c-stick zoom , it still wasn't close enough . it same feeling needing put eyeglasses see something more clearly ! aspect we didn't like four charactors always together you would lose track which one main charactor . maybe we're spoiled because c-stick spongebob allowed you rotate every direction see what around you graphics so good you could see facial expressions . it surprising all reviews so good because our impression completely opposite .	-1
then this not work your console . but if you huge old ps2 console then this work you console . if you slim console then you should get game shark	-1
my friends i high hopes this game . we played cod2 multiplayer every week excited new shooter . after playing cod3 few rounds we decided put 2 back . graphics great , but we found lot bugs . there some shading problems helmets made them turn white certain distance . that fine if you want un soldier , but not if you're trying sneak up somebody . muzzle flashes almost none existent . no blood splash like cod2 . single player game isn't too bad so far , but if you plan multiplayer i would recommend renting it first . we opinion game rushed , maybe they'll patch it	-1
if you need remote turn tele run 360 , this . but it won't operate dvr , dvd , vcr or cable box . if you're really keen it , i'll sell you mine .	-1
this remote awful quality ; i've through two them past year . i wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30 ! it worth ten , most . most people would better off buying cheap dvd player , rather than using xbox	-1
everyone seemed really excited this game ; supposed great launch title , etc . turns out red steel fails deliver like dominoes during hurricane . graphics meh ( ubisoft could way better ) , controls bit awkward . this isn't because wii controller itself ... played zelda wii sports , i say controller works very very well . so i am inclined think bulkiness shooting red steel , fact using your sword more like clubbing baby seal then fighting grace master samurai , game design , not any fault controller . storyline isn't amazing either . pretty straight-forward neverending quest save your girlfriend ( brownie points if you got pop culture reference ! ) , shoot lot japanese people process . nothing innovative see here , move now . it could lot better . i'm selling this one back ebgames getting trauma center instead . disappointing launch title .	-1
amazon . ca --------- action replay max more than just video game enhancer ( vge ) .... or least it claims . my version quite old yet but it claims include region-free dvd player memory card compression utility ( squeeze more saves onto your memory card ) . i not used either these features personally , but i heard horror stories memory manager corrupting gamesaves whole memory cards ; some reusable , some permanently damaged . this fact you must load up action replay software access saves use memory manager turned me off using it . however , real reason i bought armax its codes i'll get those second . armax , like newer gamesharks , loads its software cd . this major annoyance me . every time you load game you must insert armax memory card ( which i don't know what ) cd , go sit couch wait software load , choose your codes , then get up put actual game dvd wait it load . you can't simply turn your ps2 go sit down . old days cartridge gaming you would snap vge game console so you could turn console go sit down . early generation gamesharks little box would attach expansion slot ps1 or n64 it . if you wanted it load before game , you turned its switch . even if armax perfect every other way ( it not , btw ) , it would get maximum 4 stars long you boot it cd first . i mean , why can't memory card part it least hold codes even just current game you're playing after system shut off or reset so you don't load software every @mn time . ok , rant over . codes . user interface armax better than gameshark . functionally , they very similar course , but armax just feels cleaner easier use . it offers beginner interface includes descriptions code functions ( not user-entered ones though , if i remember right ) , more robust expert mode . big advantage , theory , armax over gameshark its ability update itself using your ps2 broadband connection . upshot you download new codes your favorite games fairly quickly instead manually typing them all using controller . dark cloud go this silver lining you no control over which codes you download ; its all or nothing . since these updates stored your memory card ( not armax one ) , it quickly fill up codes gamesaves games 99% which you never play ! no wonder armax option come 16 or 32mb space its memory card . it store all useless codes ! any entered codes you choose apply either work , nothing , or lock up game . i come across all , though armax credit , mostly former . absurd choice forcing you download save updates every game ps2 library , when you may want just one , loses armax star . note manually entering codes : sub-headings folders game their own codes must entered if you want them show up game code list . finally , mentioned reviews bret morris glenn nichols ( amazon.ca ) , armax initially not work new revision fat ps2 couple years ago all . this happened me well . i returned three ps2s two armaxes before i realized it defect all current versions ( time ) armax . i send away get new disc direct intec which now works well expected . since armax shelves several years since i bought mine , i assume any bought today would not this problem . however , time there no way find out this problem without contacting intec personally . retailers not aware problem no notices posted codejunkies web site . this inadequate treatment widespread problem drops armax down two stars . my opinion , if you're market vge , both armax gameshark their pros cons . i would assume both released newer versions newer features than ones i . looks specs , assume nothing , don't afraid e-mail companies requesting details regarding any features you questions . i apologize length this review , but i find there very few in-depth reviews vges web or print . maybe reviewers feel they above using vges , i don't know .	-1
this product not designed 360 team , really most products aren't aren't very good your 360 . this no exception , it known actually damage , destroy your 360 . statement 360 representative not but this product , it caused numerous problems lot people . mainly because it actually draws power 360 , that not good , leads lot other problems .	-1
i agree other reviewers graphics vocals good , but i find gameplay itself less than stellar . starters , i've always irritated games don't let you save your status whenever you want . sometimes i just want get quick dose gameplay , but that not possible these games require you play through entire section before allowed save . contributes repetitive , tedious nature some sections . if you get stuck getting through certain bit game , you're doomed replay much what led up it over over again . i realize tricky camera angles some challenges supposed exist this game . more than earlier versions , however , i trouble getting myself lined up whatever task . tedious element . i found this game more test my endurance patience than actual fun	-1

i try keep this brief ... way i'm only 10 hrs thru ... only just got out city #1 rabernastre , dalmasca now city #2 bahjerba ( sp ? ) : quickly , my first impressions game strange ... i like " meh i dunno if i want keep playing ... " but after maybe 20 min getting ' wierdness ' it really sucks you . ughh i really wish i didn't midterms coming up so i could go home play ! pros : - love battle system ! it still strategy but it doesn't require you random battles ... ughh i'd hate " whzzzhhh " starting random battles ... i still feel control but doing less actual work . - like everyone else says , cg always good . - story ... though not much character development/focus previous ones , i like whole war/polity centered plot . it follow fft tradition . - i actually like license board ... some people said it pain beginning , but so far it hasn't case me ... granted i very early game decide level up vaan bit ( ~ 40 min or so ) . you really just need know only use board when you really need ... don't randomly buy spots board just things become available its difficult one person learn everything . plan , plan , plan . ( right now way i'm constructing my chars way game hints ... its only one way it , but first time around i'll follow it ... already licensed equipment/abilities hint what they'll good . )- huge game . lots stuff see ... quite beautiful . - character design ... course there always someone love ... ( har har har ... fangirl i must say i love basch :d lol ... tho i love babyface earlier ff characters i think vaan too babyfaced . he looks like kid . -- haha i'm college student such fangirl ... haha ... sad isn't it ? -- if i guy , i'd say i'd like fran most ... this course subject personal opinion . )- i like subs i like how they not bland ... they fancy font this time :d . ( kinda reminds me nochnoi dozor . ) makes game really movie-ish . - widescreen capability ... ( looks sweet my widescreen pc monitor . )- course everyone always talks realism selling pelts what not ... i also like . - free-moving camera ... thank heaven . i love it . i hated still camera immensely ffx . - cute monsters ... lol love cactuar like monster rogue tomato ! - also love how you avoid some boss moves skillfully moving around them . cons : - huge game ... ( yes also con ) ... lots time running around . good thing all characters don't run painstakingly slow tidus ffx . meh ... neutral : - voices - i dunno what up people liking previous ff voice actors but anyhoo i thought this time there better ones . prev . ff voice actors okay but not great . here voice actors really good , but choice some them seems strange ... like i problem fran voice ... it strange choice strange voice . also balthier voice doesn't seem go his look , but i really like voice acting itself . ( sum , some voices , though really well acted , didn't seem fit actor look ... however , i favor good actors mismatched roles over okay actors well-matched roles so i give voice acting mild thumbs up . ) after reading review which mentioned mispronunciations , i feel i must also address ... someone who speaks some french i twitch when i heard " marquis " pronounced both " markus " " marquis " rather than " markee . " i also twitch when they pronounced " fete " " feet " rather than " feh-t . " - soundtrack - i liked all music ( there lot ) taken fft ... esp battle music estersand , i think it ... totally taken fft ( obviously both take place same world ) ... i enjoy non-midi renditions themes ... but rest new guy music just ' meh ' ... wasn't particularly bad , but it didn't really stand out much either	1

this game mysteriously hilarious always fun play . you don't exactly " finish " it , like other video games , but always trying beat your fastest time , so it doesn't get old fast . matter fact , we wore out our last copy this our second . i love it i'm parent ! my kids i play it together cheer each other . only thing i would change make two-player part funner stop giant messages pop up cover whole screen occassionally . i would keep them corner instead . overall , highly recommend this game . more than your money worth	1

i throughly enjoyed this game . voice acting may not greatest , but i think gameplay really well atmospheres fantastic . controls take some getting used too not everyone . they problem could better control , surprisenly i it very well . major problem i game progresses it gives you less times save , so you go through almost entire level ( though short ) complete it without saving once . so stupid because if you die end you entire level over again , dumbest thing ever video game . i just feel it unfair game makers make fairly difficult level then make you it over over if you slip die toward end . stupid , stupid , stupid . levels bit difficult if you're not one quick trigger . much i gripe camera angles , they're useful stopping max end hall , swing camera around see if enemy around corner , waiting steps , right inside next room , etc . it gives you heads up makes it easier stay alive . however , i still really liked it . i didn't enjoy mp2 much , but mp3 ( which should end series i think ) should , ( re : should ) much better . i'm looking forward it .	1
i always loved mario , when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite , i bought this it . this game absolutely amazingly fun ! graphics , sound , game itself incredible . this game good any adult or child . although younger child , it might bit more difficult possibly frustrating . ;) this game you try some harder levels over again , possibly again after . but every time you try again , you understand something new level , it really fun . there also features becoming mega mario mini mario which mixes things up every once while . this game wonderful , definitely great buy .	1
yeah this game really fun , just gets extremely hard times towards end . little over 10 hours into it , kind short i guess , but each mission might take you few tries complete . plus fact you might spend 30 tries some like i . i'd say it easily one best games out ds though . one everyone should their ds collection .	1
amazon.com listed this " king quest compilation " instead " king quest collection " which clearly printed my box game , well picture website . i don't know why . game itself , i remember loving king quest games when i younger . i bought this game mostly " king quest vi " which so far seemed work fine , exception one time when game kicked me out no apparent reason . this particular version " king quest vi " also seems draw it graphics original release game not cd release later , so also somewhat disappointing . captain saladin no longer looks like lassie . overall , it nice access these games nostalgia	1
what better than game made adults or kids ? sly , sneaky humor only adults understand greatest toy ever created legos ! all theme best star wars movies !! many games put ' replayability ' allowing you go through game or missions second or third time different character , but lego star wars this fashion totally fun . it not simple regurgitation map different character ( wihoo replayable ... ) but rather ingenious method rewards you additional pieces building well secret areas previously unobtainable . instance , you might need stormtrooper ( or uniform ) , jedi ( dark or light ) , or even bounty hunter enter specific areas . droids often used access areas well , but you usually them during missions . using ' free play ' mode , you go back through missions character you created , or any other character you unlocked . during mission , you cycle through your characters use their abilities . this allows you go back unlock new areas find additional bricks etc . fact there new abilities characters you find later well new areas explore really makes replayability fun worthwhile . aspect this game i absolutely love cooperative play . this great adults able play kids , or even spouses . my wife doesn't play lot xbox titles , but she loves playing this game we blast going through missions together . i'm surprised more games don't actually give you coop play like this . seems it enough toss death match label game ' multiplayer ' . my only complaint camera , both single cooperative mode . often times camera shift based one players force other player back towards center screen . more than one occasion , this caused death characters or when we get stuck forces one players swap characters midstream . sometimes this isn't obvious player . it would really nice option split screen , especially real estate hdtv provides . all all , i would highly recommend this game . especially if you kids want spend some quality time them . great game	1
third installment since rebirth classic series presumably final chapter " sands time " saga , " two thrones " takes best elements " sands time " ( game one ) " warrior within " ( its sequel ) caps franchise style , finesse , gameplay sharp scimitar blade . you once again assume mantle nameless prince persia . returning home babylon long last find it ruins its people war army sand monsters , prince also finds himself company old friends ... old enemies . cursed , he comes find his body soul split two , periodically his wicked self , known dark prince , rises forth wreak havoc take control prince body . storyline entertaining , its characters more developed than most video games , it strikes nice balance darkness light-heartedness ... something " warrior within " failed achieve . essence , it what you would get if you took tone presentation games one two rolled them together . mentioned before , gameplay not far either . while " sands time " set tone its acrobatic platforming , which remains pretty much tact , " warrior within " took game weak combat mechanics fleshed them out into something little more interesting . happily , both elements retained improved upon this new installment . what more , " tenchu " -like stealth kills now available . while they're far perfectly executed ( sometimes they seem unresponsive ) , they nonetheless offer fresh twist opportunity avoid hand-to-hand combat many circumstances . dark prince significant addition . regularly , throughout course game , prince transforms into this alter-ego - sand monster version himself able use weapon called daggertail . this weapon functions much like belmont whip " castelvania " game , allowing dark prince attack his enemies also swing poles light fixtures access new areas prince couldn't hope reach . while stronger than prince combat , unfortunately dark prince he must sustain himself constant supply sand power or succumb death when it all used up . makes these portions game more intense , , rare occasions , little more frustrating . also new series chariot trials , sequences during which prince must escape via horse-drawn wagons through hazardous environments full speed ahead . while they provide nice change pace when they actually occur , they relatively few trial error nature them lead irritation . there only few glaring flaws " thrones . " sound effects ambient music retain their inconsistent , buggy feel . too often dialogue sputters repeats like broken record , music kind fades departs little rhyme or reason . well , graphics suffer some pretty blatant clipping problems . engine aged pretty gracefully , but it aged - least character designs architecture go long way keep you distracted occasional failings visuals . " prince persia : two thrones " , many respects , very similar game two come before it . therefore it not novel first game longtime followers , but it doesn't feel long tooth it might this stage thanks new gameplay additions entertaining continuation story . it certainly better game than " warrior within , " more welcoming almost every way . this series lot life it , " two thrones " well worth your time effort .	1
this game really good , but i don't think they tested it enough figure out loading times way too long . so if you not lot patience , good luck this game :	1
i know i'm little late , but what heck ? i felt like writing review this game . final fantasy just fantastic game . simple . its extremely deep , fantastic story , great characters , great battle system , it perfect length rpg ( 45-55 hours ) . not everyone likes tidus , he honestly doesn't bother me , i think he interesting character . rest cast well developed , they all interesting personalities distinct this universe . cast very memorable , you'll remember them years come , i think speaks volumes how good this game . its enhanced usual good voice acting square known , so doesn't disapoin t.t he gameplay extremely fun , its actually one my favorite battle systems . battle system make or break rpg , this one doesn't disappoint . its fast paced , so it doesn't get bogged down long battles . you also swap characters mid battle , thats awesome feature . gameplay also incredibly deep , i've heard people literally pouring hundreds hours into this game . so if thats your thing , i'm sure you've probably already played this game . if some reason you not played this game your into rpg , don't hesitate pick this game up , its cheap now , its one best most balanced rpg i've ever played	1

this kit not just card . previous review indicated bestbuy.com selling this $49.99 . not correct . they selling card $49.99 . this kit comes card plus several other components , thus making it $20 more . you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere , but not significantly . it what it intends .	1
pros : 1 . storyline very detailed . there lot twists turns . i'm not going spoil it ... find out yourself :) 2 . weapons very nice . everything classic crowbar ( yay ! ) gravity gun preform very well . you damage just anything environment use it your advantage . 3 . physics amazing . water rippling things flying through air all very well . makes you get real sense game . 4 . a.i. challenging varified . also different weapons work better some than others so it fun experiment . 5 . there no really specific road follow this game . you explore find secret compartments stuff . 6 . there actually bunch little thinkers this game . order get somewhere , like sewage tunnel or over fence , you may something first , such flip switch or put something somewhere . gives you challenge . 7 . saving nice . you save anywhere game . so if you lose , you'll just go back you last checkpoint . cons : 1 . it loads lot . if you xbox w/ lot games it it might load slower . i'm not positive though . it runs pretty good mine but yeah , there quite lot point loading . ( but game itself makes up it ) i rated half-life 2 4/5 stars b/c it very good game . it very accurate it gameplay , making it challenging fun . plus who can't resist playing baseball headcrabs .	1
early game you use pistol rifle take down some stormtroopers new republic you explore their base , no force powers . but events make turn worse you go luke request your lightsaber back . then you begin discover force powers you search out dark jedi/killer your girlfriend rest game . amazing graphics increddible duels , this game simply magnificent . plus multiplayer awesome ( especially when you play ctf give other team boat load storm troopers you your friend rebels one bot helping you against twenty or so stormtroopers makes game game you'll never want trade ! plus duels fun play again again . i would five stars but game two or three puzzles quite difficult . all all great game any starwars fan must own , any shooter fan really , if you like both , oooh you need it really bad	1
i love this game ! it not too hard kids play ( my 10 year old beat it max points finds all secrets ) it not trashy so parents let their kids play it , they keep it clean kids some adult humor but nothing raunchy , it also cool so us adults play well ! i love creating skaters parks kids love secret skaters like jesse james jester etc . graphics better this game than others my opinion also .	1
while i think some reviews xenosaga ii little harsh , they hit few good points . terms plot , first thing really let me down kos-mos . don't let her face covering cover game fool you . while one main characters first game , she hardly anything this game until end , which seems less like plot point more creators obliging her . same said shion well . this shift center stage hurts these characters , it really disappointing . instead , jr. takes center stage . instead shedding light events first game , it opens up whole knew set issues really don't get resolved . if you're looking story pull first game , it'll hard find this game . jr. character i personally don't care much , but if you fan him , then you'll enjoy this game , you learn lot his past u.r.t.v.a new character introduced shion brother , jin uzuki . personally , i liked jin , but you don't get use him much game . him , shion , jr. albedo , there underlying theme " brothers " or " siblings " story , although don't look much elaboration jin shion . although some people aren't pleased battle system this game , i actually enjoyed it . i caught into it quicker than first game system . you also acquire skill points out enemies ' weak zones , which i found very useful . i also liked able build up attacks , then boost really slam enemy . overall , it game i really enjoyed . game some replay value it , there certain things you actually can't accomplish until you've beaten game once . times , re-watching certain scenes over over again gets boring . yet i would recommend this series , if nothing else , it serves bridge first game upcoming third game .	1
i love final fantasy games . they reason i still my nes snes . this really take me back early days square . admittedly , i've gotten older my tastes changed past 15 years ( i think its long since ff1 released ) , but this game just makes me smile . completing chocobo side quests , making sure mognet gets back online , defeating hades ozma , power leveling like mad man , laughing zidane bad ladies i am . all all , important parts game what kept me playing . now , i say there few annoying parts . you should never sell any equipment . synth shop wonderful idea , but some items end game , you need weapons you got beginning disc 1 . also some weapons disappear face planet you switch discs . little fact causes quite annoying problem those us who like see every ability fully mastered every character ( if you cant tell , i kid spent 3 months downed shin-ra plane getting everyone 255 stat points ) . overall this outstanding game . it keeps me wanting play , it makes my chronic insomnia relapse , i love just watching vivi dance during fights watching zidane get shot down over over interim . graphics this game simply beautiful . its not something ooooo ahhhh you , but if you give them second look ( after you get over cartoon-like feel ) you'll notice they someone took their time this production . someone made sure every single detail perfect . ffvii felt 2d while you knew scenery 3d endeavor , it felt like 2d isometric drawing rather than fully 3d rendered scene . when you look ffix you know you looking fully 3d environment . it really great thing see especially psx ( even though xbox 360 now out ) . characters ... what i say characters . i love them . they all make me smile . i relate completely zidane social life , then his story took me off guard first time i heard it ( i wasn't expecting it , it made me want play longer ) . garnet interesting . she naive girl we all knew high school . it just seems every character their own story it pretty well explored ( really , what you know yuffie , zell , quistis irvine ) . you ever wonder how reeve controlled cait sith while he talking scarlet heidegger ? i really not lot unanswered questions like ffix , just some things could elaborated ( like summoner village ) , but all-in-all i think story pretty perfect . my only big complaint length game . there lot stuff , but end game reached under 12 hours ( 4 months work get certain sword .... stay ragnarok if you reading this ... saying " i got excalibur ii " not worth heartache ) . this game gets 4 stars because while it good game , i just wish there more it . there plenty side quest stuff , just not enough story time . 12 hours story just long aeris stays breathing ff7 . hope this makes your purchasing decision little easier . its definitely great game heck , if worse comes worse , it good time killer rainy weekend	1
i've this game since day it came out some cutscenes my opinion better than lot games out today . this games unique gameplay i think adds its satisfactory . i love everything this game example : music : this games music unreal compared practically every other ps1 game out there . if you take time listen it your not one those gamers like i used before i actually listened any games music , than u not disappointed . gameplay : i absolutely love this games gameplay because its unique style . even though u cant really tell how much you leveled up , you still get idea when it gives u new star so you learn new moves more slots more space new put more skills . charater attack system : there 40 characters this game which i think all promote there own indivituality others . some them may same same type sometimes same basic idea move , but each character uniqely different looking than others , lot them use different weapons , armor . but one i like most all way your special moves each character get cooler looking much stronger you gain stars or levels . some people say getting so much more powerful attacks every level contributes make this games battle system easy . i dont think all because types people advantages over others so u know . but even if you , enemies heal more than you , some enemies you run because their so hard . so i dont think its simple . challenge level : i think overall this game very challenging because battle system because there countless # puzzles figure out game definetly add games difficulty . i also think games length adds its challenge meter , because there so many different paths you take game change story line , so you get different characters . so if you dont get some first time you play , you start game same data everything game before . so i think this game game you can't beat so easily one day . i would recommend this game anyone whos looking inexpensive rpg thats lengthy unique battle style amazing everything else makes this ps1 game one best games ever created date .	1
nintendo dominated handheld industry since gameboy came out . now sony stepped , some predicted their hold might finally breaking . not so , there no better proof than ds lite . lite evolutionary step over original ds , similar gameboy advance sp . it more compact form factor , brighter screens , side-mounted power button , weighs less , longer battery life , simply looks more fashionable . basic functionality ds still here- same buttons general button layout , wi-fi , gba compatibility , etc . this worth buying if you already ds ? maybe , if you've got some spare cash . this worth buying if you don't own ds ? definitely . design far superior old ds . no ds review would complete without further mention psp . while psp undoubtedly more capable device , it significant weaknesses compared ds . particularly , psp games tend far longer load times , it much shorter battery life , hardware itself more fragile . oh , course , there cost . most critical factor , however , library games available . now , ds games more better , there simply no contest when it comes which more offer this department . games what really make or break console , wide variety excellent casual immersive ds titles make it clearcut winner .	1
i am fan arena football . i enjoy watching it because it exciting , but this game doesn't live up real game . game very similiar nfl blitz except nfl blitz better . what makes unleashed worse there less teams pick all you pass . most action comes after play over when players jump each other beat each other up . if you thinking buying this game , rent it first see if it really worth money	1

i now played " vp2 " few days now , i say i like it . it its problems , but overall , it very fun game . " vp2 " takes place 100 or so years before original " vp " . i won't spoil any plot , except say many ruins visited original game appear beautiful cities " vp2 " , one gets sense we see why these cities became ruins course game . graphically , game beautiful . movies nice , if stiff times , sound great . mechanically , however , there some issues . " vp2 " attempts keep essence battle system original intact , while adding 3-d wrinkle . unfortunately , controls so gummy times you frustrated often you pleased results new system . all all , though , game excellent . i drop it star because control issues ..	1
katamari damacy breath fresh air increasingly stale gaming world . it title you likely never get tired , it odd but simple gameplay draws you back again again . music background especially catchy fun listen , makes me smile whenever i hear it . entire game experience not unlike pleasant feelings you experience after hours prolonged zen meditation , i would recommend game anyone looking something new . game only flaw it little short ; i wish it twice or three times long it .	1
story ( 10/10 ): star wars : knights old republic puts you world complete bliss utterly fantastic awe . this not just shoot-em-up game , within millions pixelated characters lies story . story jaw-dropping , mind-blowing twists turns conclusions awaiting . choose your path , first time , you choose your own destiny rather than creators . this game not just one plot , nor it mindless adventure trekking whereabouts middle nowhere looking purpose . no , this game many quests riddles , illusions games inside keep gamers their tippy-toes all times . starting out mysterious rebel who not know his/her own past , fight or peacefully sneak your way through depths several planets , each carrying many people many stories . you may help these people , you may there savior deny reward , or you may bash their helpless heads into their skulls create your path dark side . all while making venture across native lands toward beoming jedi , encounter friends , enounter foes convert them friends if you ever so wish . it doesn't matter , because end it only you facing evil sith lord , toe toe , lightsaber lightsaber . gameplay ( 9/10 ): fighting system somewhat random , but not entirely , you choose create concrete combat fighter or wizard casting spells such lighting , wind , life draining , lightsaber throwing , etc . many different various skills such stealth , persuasion , even computer hacking lockpicking ( sort ) . you stay close using lightsabers , one each hand or double-bladed one . or you stray afar using blaster rifles pistols . you many compainions , droids , jedis , dark side mercenaries wookies , each charming , dramatic , or brutal life story , which only concluded game furthers . very impressive dialogue screenwriting , graphics realism also mediocre . i guarantee , low $20 price , this game give you hours fun , each day , least month . trust me , when month up , you not want get rid it , you get urge play it again because once you start this game you hooked long-term engagement . only thing i find wrong this game it sequel . pros : ~ excellent sound , effects , dialogue , screenplay , scenery , designing story writing . ~ hundreds weapons , armor , belts , gloves , arm bands , implants masks further increase skills . ~ hundreds side quests extravagant rewards conclusions keep you awe all day long . ~ no wondering world world search plots , they usually easy find but challenging ( not boring ) accomplish . ~ no matter what , you always play game different way , so you would just beginning your quest soon you beat game . ~ neat little area xbox live downloadable content , which open up plot give you very nice weapons two new lightsaber colors . ( turquoise , orange) ~ you change overall game difficulty , it default setting medium . cons : ~ no type multiplayer games any circumstance . it surprising they didn't make o-o perative option . ~ sometimes annoying loading transitions , take maybe 10-15 seconds most . i'd advise some music handy if it your 2nd or 3rd time through game	1

yes , xbox best video game system i ever bought . i own , also , gamecube , me big mario fan ( sierously , who isnt ? ) . i've my xbox , oh , two years . but recently , it died . i'm not sure what went wrong . cords fine . i've even bought replacement cords , but it just wont come life . i thinking buying xbox 360 , until i read all bad reviews . apperently , 360 some kinks it . so , i plan buying xbox . if i you , i would purchase xbox , not 360 . ups : -great graphics . -sound = awesome . -game genre awesome ! -no need " memory cards " . -you use consol dvd player , music player ! downs : -controllers bit bulkish . -a bit faulty . obviously , more ups than downs !	1

i hearing reading all rave over this game , i finally got it myself . you tell my giving it high " star " rating , i really like it , so i'm raver now . however , if you've not played it but used first person shooter ( fps ) games , you may find this one somewhat unique . main difference far cry other popular fps games like halo doom series , this game not fast paced . far cry requires more sneaking around , use cover , diversions , etc . all all , it requires more tactical approach , rather than " bust room mow ' em down shotgun " approach . but still , there certainly intense moments just every stage where action hot . technical side : this game very robust requires array strong computing components run it . install requires 4gb . i dell w/a 2.6 ghz processor , 512 mb ram , 64 mb geforce 4 mx video card . it runs game no problem , but i one little code modification regarding directx 9.0 , but easy . i would highly recommend 128 mb video card so you run game richer graphic settings . if you like me , you prefer using game pad rather than keyboard mouse , you're out luck . there just no option any other method control . however , much i prefer my logitech rumble pad , i've found keyboard/mouse just fine this game , actually precision good mouse probably preferable . so , if you haven't got it yet , check it out !	1

this game masterpiece dragonball name . graphics nice , certain fighting sequences show some really detailed animation looks like they took it show itself ( they didn't really ) . you option just playing fusion characters doing fusion you don't any time limit all or you just select character itself . this goes transformations well , giant ape characters , super sayian levels ( not 4 they put goku vegeta ss4 seperate characters ) some bad parts first game don't exist this game . some characters didn't best moves list first game , like ss4 goku which he full power energy balls , super explosive wave , his ultimate 10x kamehameha wave . it also nice put some lesser known characters dragon ball universe game well ( garlic jr , turles , slug , jenemba first form , pikkon , pan , ubb etc . ) . however not every single character this game , which makes it look horrible when you play story mode . following characters not this game : gt goku ( little ) his super sayian formsdr . wheelo ( worlds strongest)gt trunks ssgt goten ssgt gohan ssgt vegeta his ss formsbio broly ( maybe we're better off not him this because i'm sure he wasn't very popular anyway)the 6 other dragonsgeneral rildo ( early part baby saga when gang m2)goku jrvegeta jrthis game half tenkaichi 1/3 each budokai games : 1 . dragon universe back but much better2 . some things exclusive game .

it just like cartoon series . my brother ( 7 yrs . old ) play this game hours . i play it ( 18 yrs . old ) find it enjoyable . it gives you something those slow days . there mini missions you complete . you're given awards extras game after each completion . i'd say it 100 hours complete whole game . ( i've 60% one day ... but could just me . i normally devour any game i get . ) graphics great ; story great ; it amusing ; little too colorful but you get used it .	1

i playing madden series since i kid this game really good . games just keep getting better better each year passes . everything this game worth money i strongly reccommend it	1
since there already several well written reviews already posted , i just wanted add one huge thing they've failed mention . this new version option you select swap out different players your party . this never available any other version . much like final fantasy iii ( ff6 japan ) where you comprised your team pool characters , final fantasy iv advance lets you take palom , poram , cid , yang fight moon if you'd like!there also new dungeon ( cave trials ) mt . ordeals requires you take each those characters face boss order unlock their powerful end-game weapons . each these weapons ( specific each character . i.e. you can't equip rydia palom dagger even though they're both black mages ) ultra powerful instantly makes them worthy addition your party ( especially yang ) , well maybe not edward . lolanyway , i'm sure vast majority you who buy this game played previous versions let me tell you you not dissappointed . new fight scene/magic graphics , better music , reworked dialogue unique this version , new areas make you feel like you're playing classic first time ! ps- playing this ds lit	1
i still remember getting this game 9/9/99 , day it came out . i love this game because it junction system some other cool features this game . unfortunatly , all people i knew , people either hated game ( most those people this side love/hate group ) few people loved it ( extremly hardcore rpg fans seem love it . ) . i love game but this final fantasy game whole lot people just can't stand . it long game , especially if you get stuck , so guide ( internet or actual guide i don't care ) really help . it easiest game literally reach level 100 because every 1000 exp gets you level up but using junction system also important role game because it raise your stats well . this game you play yourself . before you agree haters , give it spin , please	1
when blinx first came out , all reviews didn't really know what make it . they said this one most innovative titles come out past few years , but then they started going how hard it how it gets repetitive you go through each stage , clearing enemies proceed . well , what game isn't repetitive ? you could just easily say " all you tetris line up blocks " or " all you mario 64 collect stars " . reading time controls sounded so confusing . i didn't think i'd able handle 10 minute time limit each level while controlling time . so just week ago , i got blinx couldn't wait see how it played after countless " love it or hate it " reviews numerous people . after watching cool little intro breezing through first 2 worlds night , i saw -nothing- wrong this game . only people much trouble this those who only play rpgs or sports games , don't give platformers try . time control nothing worry either , it very simple understand , actually , you don't use time controls often . main story blinx short point . which good because i'm really sick games spending 15 minutes intros just tell you " this what going " pointless fmv . blinx quick 3-5 minute intro showing you he part millions time sweepers , time custodians clean up any problems time different planets . but suddenly , something goes wrong one them , princess kidnapped . blinx sees her gets determined save her , planet . you go through 9 worlds ( each world except last , there 3 levels , one shop , boss end ) get her back . each level , you collect time crystals gain time powers sweep ( use your sweeper/vaccum cleaner ) garbage take out all enemies level proceed next . it actually very fun i never got tired it . sweeping up different objects deals different damage enemies . garbage or flower pot won't whole lot , but beat up jaloppy , piano or even 16 ton weight , now there real damage . time crystals all over place , you gain time power collecting 3 or 4 same type . getting 3 one kind 1 any other gets you one power , but getting 4 same time crystal gets you two power . powers you use rewind , fast forward , pause , record slow motion , hearts gain you retry . if you haven't figured it out other reviews yet , it kind obvious when you need use some powers . like if you see bridge fall down , use rewind watch it rebuild itself cross . if you can't walk up river that pushing you back , rewind it so you walk up ease . if there two switches you need activate , record yourself jumping one while you jump other open door(s ) . main ones you'll using though pause slow motion , mostly because these work anything , even bosses . yeah , people go how hard bosses ... i guess they didn't figure out how use time powers . but last boss ... oh man . guy took me least total 9 hours beat . i just beat him this morning 2:59:49 am ( yes , i got exact second ) flipped out . i proud myself . he up there pocky rocky snes last boss . it like developers got mad something put all difficulty into him . because rest game pretty easy until part . side note , i love how ice levels actually ice . not magical non-slippery ice they other games . here , you pretty much skate floor if you go too fast or hit wall , you fall over get back up . it small things like make me love this game even more . graphically , blinx stunning most part . remember 10 years ago when you saw screens donkey kong country impressed models ? that what i got here . blinx himself some best graphics i've ever seen . see how he looks box ? that exactly how he looks in-game . you see fur him when he up close , they got every single detail down perfectly . every level also just much detail , there no bare areas all . there always something going . course , i can't leave out water . everyone seems impressed no matter what they think actual game . try slowing down time running through river/canal . or pausing it see trail left behind . developers fantastic job . unfortunately , some enemies don't much detail blinx . lot them just one colored shapes didn't really require much effort create . but then there some really cool design . so it little mixed bag there . last boss man , i won't even start thing . there no slowdown unless you're blasting tons garbage enemies without stopping . only other slowdown when you make it happen . it appears run 30 frames second , there nothing wrong . i really enjoyed music too , would love get soundtrack . main theme if fun enjoyable , first level contains most magical music i've ever heard . rest game good music , always fitting mood setting . final boss music really puts you mood take ' em out , it full energy concentration . sound effects cartoony , but that not bad thing . when blasting garbage enemy , you get zany little effect sounds like something tom jerry . voices however , i'm confused . they're not bad . fact , blinx great delivery voice acting not much personality ( he platformer character . he doesn't need personality ) . but i could've sworn they spoke japanese beginning . i know fact i translated some words meaning what text screen meant . but end , i didn't understand single thing . i guess they made up their own language here just like they panzer dragoon orta . but there isn't lot language going , just belts blinx most time . though he say some things english once while . i noticed " yay ! " " burned kitty food ! " when he got knocked out into lava pit . keep ear out what pigs say when you hit them garbage whenever they show up level . i swear one you fight most time goes " you suck ! " when he gets hit . it pretty intimidating hear even if you're winning . blinx didn't disappoint me all . it tons replay too . you get rank when you complete level , if you get all a+ or s+ ranks , you get cool treat . plus there cat medals each level add little bonus clips . first few pretty lame , but you get more , they turn out great . going back figuring out new ways beat bosses always fun too . i just can't stress how much i love this game . my shelf , i put this above knights old republic jet set radio future . but right behind panzer dragoon orta . what i've heard , demo sequel ( i'm amazed this thing well enough get sequel ) even better . blinx 2 probably first xbox game i get full price when it comes out . so get this if you're looking little bit " old school " feel superb graphics quality ... course fun . that all matters games , fun	1
this unique game takes keen eye ability remember small details . many times , whether or not you're successful depend how good you finding inconsistencies testimony , or things " just don't sound right " . animation very lo-tech , where each scene just stationary backdrop . if there character you interacting , they cycle through their 5 or so generic facial states it suits dialog . there * lot * reading , unfortunately , some characters love talk . music simple infectious , interface easy navigate either via touch stylus or buttons , you save your state game any time , so you take cases your own pace . it unique game just rewarding it frustrating . characters interesting , if you own ds , this game worth	1

you darkened corner . you watch patrolman descends stairs . you size him up , noticing his ak-47 drawn . you quietly sneak up behind him , when he stops walking , you grab him . you place your silenced pistol up his forehead drag him into darkened corner . guard walks into room . you quickly turn your pistol towards him , shoot , then turn back your hostage . you quickly hit him back neck , knocking him out . this great game . it made ( i believe ) 2001 , yet graphics rival games such halo 2 . physics game amazing , it very well programed . your guns drop shells , which stay ground breifly , bullets leave holes walls . guards notice you if you too loud , if their comrades sniped , they sometimes open fire , even not knowing where you . you knock out , kill , or avoid enemies . graphics , like i said , amazing . fire looks very realistic , lighting perfectly . people look realistic , not quite so much scenery , but even games like halo 2 , people not focus . missions change greatly , environments change them . dialouge isn't great , but it decent , if you dont play too close attention it , it nice backround noise . all all , if you one game buy , buy this one .	1
love this game . great story line . just make sure your computer handle it	1
my opinion , this best game xenosaga series . first game received lot well-deserved praise recognition . however , i believe this third game better just every aspect . battle system new introduces concept break . idea place your opponent state , avoiding it your characters . turn-based battle system also very quick . you don't wait 30 seconds your characters execute their battle moves . playable characters respond attack soon you choose type attack you want perform . previous games , you either fight foot or aboard giant e.s. humanoid machines . item equipment shops back , well ability customize your characters fine level . you won't much options choose first game , but ability very close . best part this game though story . i am forty years old read many novels , watched many great movies , played lots video games . my opinion , story told this game surpasses anything i ever come across . plot good . characters very well-developed seem take life you play game watch plot unfold . there action , drama , revelations just every scene . each main plot previous episodes brought conclusion . this truly masterpiece story-telling . i only hope one day , this very moving , thought-provoking , captivating , uplifting story more accessible people who don't play video games . lot people find it spiritual philosophical . yes , theme very serious dramatic . unlike more common whimsical theme most games . but trust me , you play many hours non-stop just watch plot unfold . concepts destiny , purpose , free , choices , life , afterlife , beliefs , love , despair , consequences constantly present story . central character shion uzuki , designer amazing android kos-mos . allen rest supporting cast back . this time , they out uncover plot vector could put future universe danger . mini-game there case you want take break main story enjoy fun game hackox . ofcourse , you professor , jr. allen lighten things up just bit also .	1

advertising this collection led me believe i would getting these 7 games their original formats ... but i disappointed find not original version kq1 , but sci version released 1990 . kq6 voice commentary instead text , but you switch back text if you like -- i haven't found any such option kq5 , so it looks like you're stuck voice ( no supplemental text , either , so it gets annoying fast ) . i haven't look kq4 yet but everything else seems same . i'll glad play these games without wrestle our old tandy , but i wish they didn't get messed . especially disappointed there no text option kq5	1

both final fantasy iv chrono trigger excellent games ( ct could my favorite game all time ) . final fantasy iv excellently restored its original " hardtype " version . story elements dialog restored , which extremely exciting . however , i complaint port . somewhere port , code saving game not optimized playstation but instead uses version works fine solid-state memory ( like cartridge , which these games originally ) but horribly when going cd solid-state . this serious flaw , saves take up half minute complete . why this game gets 3 stars overall	1
