some people before me said already , this scent isn't lovely . i am sjp-fan , i almost certain i would love new perfume this stylish lady . it isn't released yet holland , but i found sample germany where it already released . i disappointed . smell isn't bad , but it isn't something i would like smell like . it isn't lovely all . it too sporty . i expected something more flowery . scent reminded me most deodorant ( cheap brands ) or toilet-refreshener . so , although i am sjp-fan , i wouldn't like smell like her . pity . my favourite perfumes ( comparison ): beyond paradise ( estee lauder ) , curious ( britney spears ) , couture !

i pretty honest - i excited get this kit , but so far i've disappointed . maybe i'm not getting whole technique down , but i find diagrams pretty generalized powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed ( like under my eyes , making them look very raccoon-y tired -- when wearing smoky eyes , i figure you probably want everything else look pretty bright comparison dramatic eye effect ) . maybe i can't pull look or maybe i'm not applying it correctly , but either way , it always ends up looking like big , dark , glittery mess ... i'm big bare escentuals lover , but i disappointed this product .	-1
i enjoyed using this product because i liked tingling mint - not necessarily good thing , actually rather meaningless appearance cleanliness my face . kaolin bentonite drying agents , peppermint harsh sensitive skin . if you separate out so-called natural ingredients , you left same basic stuff any other cosmetics company uses . if it doesn't come straight out ground , it ain't natural anymore ! i give it 2 because i sucker tingling , not because i saw any improvement my skin texture , look , or feel	-1

i read many positive reviews pure grace decided try it since i love fresh , clean scent . i very disapointed when i used it , it reminded me jean nate , which me old lady smell . it more musky than clean smelling . i couldn't smell any hint feminine sweetness or floweriness it . it smelled like scented musky water sesemee oil ... only way i describe it	-1

i ordered this fun since decided it definitely not me any way . it very drying my skin , even though it thick creamy . label says it award-winning , but doesn't state what award it received ( if any ! ) . i fail see what might warrant it award-winning . scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy . also , it absurdly priced given quality . i've tried few philosophy items need just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed .	-1
i bought this hoping i would look good get my face cleaned . no lie , this soap makes you look uglier than you really . so unless you wanna smell little weird not look your best , dont buy this soap ! im serious !	-1
i purchased this shampoo my daughter after she read rave reviews teen magazine . she thick , blonde hair it dry summer heat , pool water , light styling . after trying rehab shampoo , she so disappointed it nothing help her hair . she said while it lathered nicely , it felt like it stripped her hair when it rinsed out , it left her hair overly ' squeeky ' tangled . end result once her hair dried ( after using conditioner , too ) , it lighter shade blonde , very fly-away , dry feeling . she hoping smoother , easier manage hair . we debated purchasing this shampoo because its high cost , i say we extremely disappointed . claims hype , results not delivered . her hair no means ' fried ' or severely damaged , so i fully expected her some more manageable locks after using product , based its claims . i say i bought her shampoo condition drug store helped dramatically . it thermasilk smooth silky line , it works wonders over rehab fraction cost . save your money this one	-1
i noticable undereye cirlces bought this product hopes it you lighten them bit . i use this product mornings evenings several weeks . nothing changed . i figured maybe it would take more then few weeks notice anything so i continued use this product ( use entire jar , just give it plenty time ) , still not difference could seen . me it waste money .	-1
one my former roommates used kerastase nutritive shampoo very dry hair . i remember it smelling great endorsed celebrities " it " shampoo treating dry , unruly tresses . other day , i saw this shampoo clearance shelf meijers regrettably made impulse purchase . even clearance price , this shampoo still expensive . i very thick , wavy , somewhat dry hair needs lots conditioning products -- when i checked out ingredients ( after i bought shampoo ) , i groaned inwardly . almost all ingredients ( exception water ) aubrey organics ' " ingredients avoided " list ( , they considered toxic ) . like aubrey organics , other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens preservatives because they mildly estrogenic absorbed through skin . this shampoo six different types parabens -- methyl , ethyl , propyl , etc . if product such steep asking price , then you would think its manufacturers would put forth better formula , incorporating non-toxic , natural ingredients ( like aveda , biolage , biosilk ) . least suave v05 ( bargain-priced shampoos ) boast vitamins silk amino acids their formulas ( though many their other ingredients also found " avoided " list ) .	-1
i wasn't really thrilled this product . it smells great but soon shower over thrill gone	-1
this , hands down , worst perfume i ever smelled . if you're mood smell sexy , don't wear this . if you're mood smell girlish , don't wear this . if you're mood smell classy , don't wear this . other words , i no idea what kind mood you actually want wear this . i literally went around work asking twenty coworkers what they thought , they all agreed this awful . only person i imagine wearing this senior citizen . it just smells terrible drab .. it wasn't i got bad bottle either , i've smelled it stores it same . truly terrible	-1
my experience : i heard such great things prevage - restores youthful skin , reverses damage , etc ., i couldn't wait until it available . finally , i able buy it - nice packaging , great dispenser just right amount . after two months , i found it only great under makeup moisterizer , there plenty others equal efficacy 1/10 price - eucerin , instance . kinerase nothing me either , so it may just me - just fyi - fair , sensitive dry skin , middle aged .	-1

me , it barely looked like i mascara all . i blonde eyelashes , so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop , this didn't really . i ended up giving it my mom , thinking maybe it just me since so many others loved it , she didn't like it either . it ended up garbage . i've loved dior show mascara course , great lash . i'd recommend those over this , especially money	-1

what point this mascara when half container doesn't what it supposed ? black mascara not good quality -- it comes off very quickly . part problem may brush simply too tiny -- larger brushes far superior when it comes applying mascara . silver stuff -- only reason someone would seek out this product -- all but invisible lashes regardless how many times you go over your lashes wand .	-1
my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
clinique exfoliating scrub facial scrub oily skin . it thick , white paste packed medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than clinique " 7 day scrub " normal skin . use , massage onto clean , wet skin circular motion . rinse warm water . careful not get it your eyes , i once while rinsing it off shower . this scrub adequate job exfoliating retexturizing skin . but it unsuitable sensitive skin , it stinks high heaven . it contains menthol , which burns skin clears sinuses no extra charge . so much menthol so close my nose not good thing . course , it " 100% fragrance free " according clinique , meaning smell menthol unadulterated perfumes . scrub also contains salicylic acid , so beware this might too drying some skin types , especially if used frequently . performance isn't bad . olfactory aesthetics atrocious . this harshest , most caustic facial scrub i've ever used . sensitive complexions beware	-1

( i am real scent meister too . ) i used it bubble bath , guess what ? bubbles gone within minutes . stick avon bubble bath , it still bubbles tub when you ! then i used it shampoo . guess what ? it didn't lather ! i ended up using trusty suave finish bath . very disapointing product ! i bought 32oz . myself christmas present , can't wait till it gone	-1

first it smells very sharp citrusy , almost like men cologne . then few seconds later it mellows out bit smells somewhat herbal . after 15 minutes you won't able smell it all . very hyped up mediocre perfume very steep price tag . you'd better off buying bottle herbal essence shower gel getting identical results	-1
i got this bar based other reviews , boy , it strong ! bar last very good long while , unless you actually stomach smell gallons patchouli without getting major headache . patchouli originally supposed base scent other sweeter scents sit upon . it never supposed stand-alone perfume ! like all lush bubble bars , this definitely packs bubbles small amount . i just buyers remorse because i now this oversized bar ( it very big bar ) , i only use bits it when my fiance out town because he gets allergic reaction strong strong strong smell . i think upside it seems like scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually * * bath . or maybe then your olfactory senses so overwhelmed you just can't tell difference anymore.so yeah , if you love love loooooooove patchouli , then this truly bath bar you . otherwise , i'd steer clear go something gentler . hot milk bubble bar opposite this bar , it really gentle nose . any jasmine flavored products would also better recommendation than this one . i love lush , but not this bar	-1
i write caps because i am so irritated . i tried 5 different carol hair products none including this one worked . not only smells aren't all great they scream . it like people who wear bad perfume that extremely strong , but smells horrible , they think it smells good but it disgust everyon	-1

i just got this item ( ebay , it cheaper)and feel it worthy praise . i thick , straight hair , bought this product wave my hair . i haven't figured out how it curls , but wave it incredibly easy ! grab your hair root twist outward it waves nice fast w/o burning your hair like curling iron would . also w/ curling iron , it difficult wave top close roots . it heats fast ! comes w/ nice pouch so you put it away before it cools .	1
after watching blow out seeing how passionate jonathan his product , he sold me . anyone who determined make best product market , obviously whatever it takes make it happen . after seeing how much product , i cringed fact bottle shampoo would much . i later , literally dragged myself sephora purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing i willing take risk could eventually end up my closet . i bought it , went straight my bathroom , washed my hair . shampoo not lather , which i expected considering there no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate . conditioner very light , thin substance . definitely not thick . finale-dried my hair , right there , i knew this product definitely best hair product far , i ever used . my hair , very damaged , brittle full split ends . this product made my hair , very very full , full shine , very soft . my hair beautiful days .... last test .. going work . soon i put my hair down pony tail ( i'm waitress ) , instantly everyone noticed my hair . they asked " what you ?? your hair soo beautiful " .. i told them " 40 dollar shampoo conditioner " well worth cost . definitely salon bottle . now my worst fear it discontinued any reason . if so , i am willing spend 1k stock up save much i . there no other product like it	1

i've gotten few compliments it ... my advice ladies who want buy perfume via online ... buy smaller bottles first see if you really like scent ... moreso than big bottles . i bought $50 one i like it , but i think it gonna take me awhile finish it ... so now , i'll buy 1.7 oz . first then buy bigger bottles if i like scent . but overall , very fresh sweet smelling ..	1

this powder great . it great coverage without looking cakey . i also sensitive skin this never bothered me . only reason i gave it 4 stars because it still little dark very light skin it needs " touched-up " little more often than other powders i've tried , but it worth it	1

if you're like me , you get occasional zit most inopportune time . benefit boo boo zap ! bit spendy such small amount ( size small tube lipstick ) but it help . while it won't erase zit overnight , it get red out . you dab some under or over makeup too because it goes clear , not tinted . definitely worth try	1

this product not work everyone . it not really people straight , fine hair . it formulated target mostly women color who tightly curled , thick , natural hair . i apply nickle-size this stuff ends my hair before i style it . it leaves my hair soft , manageable , conditioned - eliminating breakage so it grow long healthy . aroma little too earthy my personal taste , but i handle long natural ingredients work . i give it 5 stars	1
this product fantastic ! i use it my daughter who very thick , beautiful coarse hair ! it tames her enough so it not unmanageable leaves it shiny soft - this works well hair balm !!	1
i recently became fan body shop products am only sorry i didn't try them sooner . their products all , without fail , superior quality . satsuma line especially wonderful , my favorite scent body shop . it juicy fresh smell tangerines/oranges . i read some reviews it reminds people creamsicle type scent but i completely disagree . i never liked creamsicle scents i love satsuma . it not cloying or too sweet . it very pure scent i always feel clean beautiful while wearing it . one other thing note this product ... i not always like perfume oils because scent not always accurate when compared other products same line . i am not sure if this because sometimes oils so concentrated they smell like " too much " . satsuma oil not like all - it smells true rest line . scent also lasts long time after applied , due fact it perfume oil . little goes long way - i would not surprised if bottle lasted over year . i love this product give it my highest recommendation .	1
my significate other bought shampoo me , i use hair butter various other products carol daughter . i very fortune actually make it store new york . i very short barber-style hair scent drives people wild . i continue buy these products ; if you like fruity-tuttie smells your hair grease non petroleum based , carol daughter you	1
this stuff wonderful ! i still use moisturizer w/ spf 15 , but why settle spf 15 when you get spf 40 ? this not creamy sunscreen makes your skin feel all oily like it can't breathe , instead it more liquid side you just quickly rub it , then you go ahead put your regular moisturizer makeup over it . it lovely light you wear it every day . it only sunscreen i found enough spf coverage my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough clog up my pores cause breakouts . it may seem expensive , but not only quality product worth it , but you only need small amount . i wear it during spring summer , after year i'm still working same bottle . i wasn't sure if it going effective ( not brand you usually associate rugged outdoor activity ) , but after week beach , i only one who face wasn't burned all red , even though everyone else wearing coppertone bullfrog facial sunscreen	1
this scent truly intoxicating . i tried various perfumes like arpege , evelyn rose j'adore but there always something missing . flower kenzo far most satisfying fragrance . it elegance arpege , sensuality evelyn rose classiness j'adore . this product-line also matching deoderant so not clash perfume . how nice ! it not too strong either but lasts long time . i last found my favorite scent makes me feel really good	1

my title says it all . this smells so amazing , such lush fabulous lather , i never wash any other soap again . i even bought perfume because i found myself sniffing my arms all day long after shower . it fantastic , it totally worth money , it lasts long time . one bottle lasts me 2-3 months , bathing every day . i've even used this my hair before ... but it tends dry out my hair lot i need lot moisture because i blonded curly hair .	1
great salt scrub it really get warm contact leaves skin baby sooofft	1

i changed this review when i first wrote it couple weeks ago . when i first wrote it , title " i like it " . now i've changed it " i love it !!! " because more i use it , more sure i am i not ever buy regular mascara again . this mascara not smudge ! it not leave " racoon eyes " under your lash line . it goes where you put it stays there until you take it off . it also not irritate my eyes . i never thought i would find mascara didn't make me want rub rub my eyes . i hate rubbing my eyes because i know it makes them baggy makes wrinkles . i seeing mascara which forms tube around lash advertised high-end catalogs lately , intrigued . when i found out philosophy , brand i really respect , this type mascara available , i order it right away . soon ups man brought it , i applied it . it makes your lashes look really long ! they lot individual definition , show up very distinct . this mascara doesn't " fatten " lashes , but it lengthens them so much , it much cleaner look than lash thickening mascara i using . i really like look , mascara not smudge , or rinse off easily water . it seems stay really well , without clumpy , greasy feeling i get waterproof mascara . it comes off neatly little chunks when you rub little " purity made simple " cleanser it . i really like this mascara , i buy it again . actually i am going throw out all my other kinds mascara only get this kind	1

what i really like this product little goes long , long way . i used use various body butters my driest skin , this product like those you don't need use much it . just bit enough , even really dry areas like elbows , knees , feet . i find one fingertipful enough both knees elbows or both feet ; two fingertipfuls enough my legs , post-shaving . i like it better than body butters because it light not greasy ( unless you use too much ) , you use it your whole body , not just drier spots . big plus scent : it fresh , clean herbal scent doesn't linger over-long , so you enjoy it while you're putting it not smell it all day long	1

it over 4 hours since i showered i still catch scent i move . it such sweet , sugary smell reminds me summertime pop music . this may sound like odd description , but it smells way inside jawbreaker tastes , sweet sugary . it also hint cherry or strawberry it . yum yum ! i got two bars cut one up into small cubes wrap cloth put my dresser drawers scent my clothes . i love love love this stuff . reviewer who said this only lasts week must use ton soap ( though who could blame her soap like this ? )or take multiple baths/showers day , because i used it week it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it . it really helps unwrap soap soon you get it so it air harden before you use it . this helps it last longer .	1
this one most perfect concealers i ever used . it goes nice creamy ( not pull your skin when applying ) covers those imperfections . you also not need lot product get job . colors very natural i found perfect color sand me . i buy this product again .	1

i pulled lid philosphy vanilla birthday cake bottle inhaled wonderful smell vanilla birthday cake . it smells 100% like its glorious namesake . while some people complain feeling strange bathing birthday cake or strawberry milkshake , i think it just type aromatherapy . cake makes me happy , birthdays make me happy , this birthday cake smelling body wash shampoo really makes me happy ! plus bodywash shampoo it functions very well . my skin feels smooth , my hair feels light , silky not weighed down . my hair still smells little like birthday cake , which isn't good second day , but it not overpowering . i don't think i use this my everyday shampoo , but it great throw gym bag quick after-workout shower	1
hi , i just wanted let everyone out their know : this stuff works . i problematic hormonal acne since age 21 . i'm 27 now . after i graduated university started working real job , stress went straight my face ( you all know what i am talking ) . unfortunately me , i am allergic benzyl peroxide i extremely sensitive skin . i also not well tea tree oils most sulfur acidic products ( basically anything kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like tomato or ineffective i painful acne bumps ... which would you rather ? ) . i little hesitant after reading ingredients noticed cleanser sulfur it there also jar pure salicylic acid blemishes . but , after using other philosophy products my hair body - i decided give it try . hell , what 50 bucks if it clear my acne - if not i always send it back . i started using it 3 weeks ago my skin tremendous transformation . i finally feel like my acne under control . i recommend this product fully it my duty tell everyone this after suffering relentless acne so many years . cleanser awesome needs larger size . blemish serum extremely drying , so if you sensitive like me read directions take it slow - don't reapply throughout day , until your skin ready . day night face creams cool . day one kind like glue seals treatment - entire day ! that why it works , because it your face until night time when you wash ( i even faintly smell product ) . then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream , yes not benzyl . yeah , this cream intense well . so take it slow until your skin ready . one thing i recommend if you wear make-up , use purity cleanser ( not kit ) initially clean your skin then use acne cleanser . that what i it works me - so i share it you . thing i i take little bit hope not enough spf moisturizer put very little my super dry areas . remember this acne kit intense you may prone drying out peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer help hydrate area around acne . well that it . i hope this helps you let you know your acne tamed doesn't run your life . take care , . rodriguezsurprise , az	1

i thick very coarse hair ( you read title ) i am trying grow out , i tried everything before help tame mane . i always look product not only puts back moisture into my hair , but something fortify it well prevent more damage . i've tried almost every single intensive conditioner stores tried lot salons well , however this one i came across accident . my aunty gone frederic fekkai promo sale bought whole bunch stuff . it didn't really much her hair , so she passed them me try . some stuff i wasn't too impressed , but this hair mask wonders my hair ! after just one use , i could totally tell difference feel texture my hair . usually , i straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet tame it , however this product i didn't too much after . i let my hair air dry just put anti-frizz cream after , good . mask washes out clean ( no greasy residue ) , so this product really good weekly restoration . but what it seems like , this hair mask ( all products , i suppose ) work some people not others . your best bet get your hands sample size before you shell out money full tube , since it kind expensive	1

fragrance addict i try anything once- but i am hooked this stuff . i don't often purchase solid perfumes all ones i tried tend greasy feeling , don't last very long . this completely different- it easy apply but isn't all greasy last quite while . this scent beautiful floral/spicy not overpowering . if you enjoy lovely sarah jessica parker , i think you'll enjoy this too- plus you take it anywhere- it only big tube lipstick . finally , beauty habit sent me little handwritten note thanks little bag perfume lotion samplers my order . i can't wait try other scents crazylibellule poppies i would definitely shop again beauty habit . good stuff	1
this sweet treat ! it smells good enough eat . it also leaves my skin smooth soft . it works good shampoo my thick , wavy hair too . cinnamon buns 3-in-1 wonderful product everyone should buy it . totally worth $dough$ . ha ha	1
philosophy products really changed my skin , i know this true because times i run out philosophy products replaced them even very expensive department store brands , my skin starts breaking out looking blotchy , uneven tired . then i remember how much philosophy me , i absolutely reorder . if you buff your face microdelivery peel , wash thoroughly " purity cleanser " , then follow this product , " when hope not enough serum " then " hope jar " moisturizer your entire face neck , your skin just glow , you amazed how fast blemishes blotches just go away don't come back ! after using microdelivery peel , my skin looks 75% better right away . after week using all products , my skin clear glowing . i really believe these products . they feel great , smell great work great	1
blessed very large pores my nose cheeks i looking something might help reduce appearance my pores . they seem enlarge i age . came across this product somewhat accident . i really amazed how well it works . just small dollop tapped lightly skin your pores vanish your skin looks perfectly smooth . it mattifies skin all day ( i extra oily skin ) . other clinique products made my skin break out , but this stuff wonderful if you suffer acne your nose or cheeks . highly recommended	1
even swimming two hours pool , i still mascara when i emerge water . would not without this !	1
this not strong floral fragrance not sweet , but it smells wonderful . it just gets better better your skin . very complex , very different	1
long time i avoided anything gardenia like plague-it always smelled too sickly sweet me . this perfume changed my mind completely-yes , there gsrdenia but its very light fresh unlike any gardenia you've ever smelled . try it yourself	1
i say i quite impressed this fragrance . i tend look other way when product receives little too much hype or attention . i can't say this cologne worth great deal hype , but i say it pleasant disctinctive odor . cologne not something you would wear daily basis , but would go very well suit special occasion . bad side , cologne elegant odor comes slightly feminine aroma . while i am not one prefer " musky " cologne i could without smelling like woman . additional downside would it high cost per ounce ... overall , since receiving cologne gift , i am quite pleased adding this fragrance my collection . good job diddy daddy puff ...	1
when i first got package delivered me work , my assistant i smelling all products ... this one made both us scrunch our noses distaste . but when i got home actually applied it my hair , it smelled nothing like nasty old lady smell i detected before . reason why i given this product 5 stars , because i feel this conditioner unfairly graded here . conditioner people curly or processed hair -- meaning , if you straight , thick hair , this conditioner may seem like waste money due amount product you apply . also , us girls curly hair know , not all curly hair equal . some thick , springy curls gets curlier shorter cut it , while others thinner quality their hair which actually gets curlier longer it gets . i'm later , i think this why this product works me . i understand how this may seem misleading those thicker curl types , but i'm here set record straight one . i hope it helps deciding if this product right you	1
i really enjoyed this bomb - it very refreshing relaxing . it big bomb i could broken it half but i didn't want risk missing thing ! so far i happy my lush purchases my favorite bomb sex bomb , but i would buy this one again or give it gift	1
i tried apple cider clarifying shampoo reccomendation saleswoman sephora . i never happier shampoo . i fine/ oily hair product buildup problem me . after using this , it felt like i just left salon . my hair shiny , squeaky clean , it body sooo soft . i also got several comments people work how good my hair smelled . i only use it once week , not only conserve ( it pretty pricey per ounce ) , but also it clarifying so i don't want dry out my scalp ( this happened me before ) . so i shampoo condition other products during week	1
this not my first purchase iman cosmetics . i love coverage powder gives color compliments me very well . i would definitely purchase this powder again	1
this product blended well into my skin , i forget i wearing makeup . what amazing avon their products very economical yet very high quality . i am usually acne-prone so i am careful what i use my face . it not oily yet even dry skins use it . it very matte worn alone	1
this powder provides excellent coverage without thick . ( thick powder base horrible - it always looks like you dunked your face bowl flour . ) my freckles still there , but my skintone more even . it its job concealer very well - no red spots , no dark circles - it works very well foundation/powder . much better than any other powder foundation i've ever used . come think it , much better than any liquid foundation i've ever used	1
i love this stuff ! i " my mother hands " my sister calls them . years go they're getting more more wrinkly i also age spots . i gave some my sister last year now she got me buying it too ! this hand cream makes my hands smooth silky feeling without greasy . it also improved condition my cuticles only few applications . i'd highly recommend it anyone who dry hands cuticles . you'll love it too	1
best thing this product there numbing agent . apply leave skin 20-30 seconds then your skin begins numb slightly , then you start shaving . it great because you don't feel razor skin much ; which makes shaving quite pleasant . i've searched other shaving cream market this numbing feature closest anthony logistics which i don't think nice philosophy common man . little goes long way when you shave so tube lasts quite long . i would buy this again ...	1
i've never liked my lashes until i put this . what difference	1
when you buy this perfume your girlfriend , don't tell her it under 40 dollars ! i don't know why people make big deal over expensive perfume . yeah , like it really smells better just because it more expensive . anyway , sarah jessica parker perfume really nice scent you'll want smell over over . it nice you don't spend lot money it either . add just touch proper use	1
this fragrance starts off fine , but longer you wear better it gets , very nice smell lasts wonderfully long time !!	1
if you're like me your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color , nioxin system scalp therapy answer . ( numbers only represent type hair you , use lower number if your hair more fine . ) use this once or two times after color , scalp itch goes away . product claims help thinning hair . i no issue , i think i found " off-market " use product , but it works me so i'll take it	1
i wasn't crazy this mascara when i first put it but it grew me . brush not regular mascara brush it took little getting used however i love it now . it brushes clumps right off your lashes you apply . they'll long nicely separated . stuff stays your lashes like glue all day . no smearing it still looks perfect end day point where i feel like it shame wash my eye makeup off . i'm really pleased it . i want try lancome new mascara too but this one definitely keeper .	1
what i like most these vitamins they very small easy swallow , unlike lot other hair nail vitamins which huge . i am not sure if i notice difference condition my hair but i continue purchase use vitamins nevertheless	1
i beginnings crow feet . essential eye cream helped decrease lines restored elasticity suppleness delicate skin around my eyes	1
i given this product gift , i just love it . i'll often wear it weekends without any additional makeup . it smoothes this skin surface . true - coverage not same tinted foundation - but it offers lot improvement worn alone . also , i using tinted cream makeup base not working well my dry skin . it would create lines , etc . so i started combining two things - tinted cream base philosophy skin perfector together sponge before applying bingo - this solved problem . so if you want tint plus smoothness , you might want give this try .	1
i first tried amazing grace couple years ago . time i dresser full department store colognes . scent amazing grace somehow undescribable . suffice it say , it " perfect " fragrance , those other scents history . it pleasing person who wears it , pleasing someone just walking you . some perfumes walk into room before person , or so strong it makes other people eyes water . we've all around someone like . not so amazing grace . it just harmony you those around you	1
i am bonafide lush junkie , this stuff what makes me so . smells great , works wonders , $22 dollars high end shampoo , you couldn't get better deal . this stuff last me 4 months least	1
if you dry skin your feet these socks fantastic . i place mine microwave 15 seconds while i apply moisturizer my feet . slide socks onto your feet soon microwave finished . 15 minutes you quick , but effective moisturizing treatment . if your feet really dry you could same thing but leave them overnight . i found overnight option little warm my feet . but , it might work fine you . these socks 94% cotton 6% spandex . they machine washed tumbled dried . i not found it necessary launder them each time i use them . i use light moisturizer ( kerasal ) , so you might different experience if you use heavier product moisturize . i would highly recommend this product .	1
this stuff amazing . i use " candle light " underneath my eyes around my brows . it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long . it especially beautiful sunlight - really makes my blue eyes pop !	1
i searching what seems like forever nice cologne or perfume not all flowery overpowering . now i finally found it ! i love this scent ! it just smells so clean fresh . i'm so glad i tried it ! first couple times i wore it , i received compliments questions what i wearing . never happened me before . so i went purchased lotion shower cream too . only bad thing it , like many others said , smell doesn't last too long so i keep reapplying it . maybe now i lotion too , smell last longer . i would highly recommend trying this fragrance . i think you love it	1

i recently realized while my wife spends hundreds high quality skin care products us , i still using throw away razors . i recently received fusion razor loved , until i went replace blades . $4+ piece , they last no longer than any other blade . so , i got online researched shaving what i learned , though there advances shaving technology , nothing improved , only made more expensive . i learned my dad right ; all it takes great shave good safety razor , decent brush , shaving soap mug . i received my razor couple days ago now , i wake up eager take shower shave . nothing ever cut this close without giving me razor burn . my skin sensitive i no problems since getting this amazing razor . it worth price , too , because it same cost 4 sets fusion replacements . replacement blades this razor fifty cents piece far better job . i read reviews this razor people who , apparently , weren't trained shave . this razor not cut against grain . also , handle weighted , so you allow razor all work , or you run real risk filleting your face . patient . great shave takes little more commitment than just breaking out foam disposable razor . let razor work . i assure you , even if it takes few days get technique down , you thrilled this razor . nicest feature this amazing razor it allows you adjust closeness blade . i learned most people like it one one half . mine set one half it gives me perfect shave every time . until now , i didn't know such thing even possible . happy shaving	1
like i stated title , this isn't my favorite three-in-one product philosophy . i several their scents , i really love cinnamon buns some chocolatey ones . strawberry milkshake smells nice , but it very sweet . i wouldn't say it smells artifical , but it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries , either . i used it shampoo/conditioner quite often , i no issues it . i fine hair , it didn't leave me tangles , like some other reviewers complained .	1
i find these soaps very good . there actually 4 different kinds i believe one also sensitive skin . if someone felt none clean feeling afterwards , perhaps they not taking their makeup off proper product , or they using wrong soap their skin type . this soap similiar dhc soaps japan . if they drying try using correct soap . help i would suggest going clinque counter or ask me .	1
this shaving brush perhaps most inexpensive way get pure badger bristle shaving brush . i've now using it year half , it not shed any real amount its bristles like cheaper brushes market . brush head remains densely packed quite soft . hopefully , it remain way some time come . meantime , i enjoy close comfortable shaves aided this brush . because it , i sworn off canned shave gels every situation except travel . they just can't compare your average $1.50 cake shaving soap this brush . this very worthwhile purchase me	1

it very good conditioner . it light yet conditioning . but me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish . it smells distinctively barnyard . but i see many like smell so maybe it just me .	1

this my everyday scent last six years . predominent note sparkling anise , anise affects cold , even metallic , chemic artifice . swirling this shivery base note hints moss , violet , vanilla-like tonka , lending aura both forest fantasy . though this relatively popular scent , lolita eschews convention . there no white flowers , no rose , no peach , none banal cloying sweetness plagues so many scents . this perfume instead sensual yet apart , not all come-hither but insinuating dark grimm tale . tonka sweet powdery , gently seductive , while more prominent anise intoxicates . bottle stunning ; i never throw out spent one .	1
i love include one these gifts ...... people love them ..... makes bath really special ..... little rosebuds floating water ..... just charming	1
if you love roses , this romantic bath luxury , seven rose buds your bathing delight . candlelit bath romance , let it dissolve unencumbered . scent but no mess , put it mesh bag first , because little flower bits all over tub . least it no glitter . scent not particularly strong , but it full natural rose scent smells wonderful	1
i love this soap ! it smells so fresh my skin feels great after i wash it ! i am definetely ordering more this soap	1
i started using this cream during my 2nd month pregnancy . i think it important start building elasticity your skin early , which could reason i success it . while cream kindof expensive -- when you think avoiding stretchmarks , no price too high . i used 4 tubes duration . i expected get stretchmarks because my mom them me , so i happy get anything less than hers . anyway , i didn't get any all my stomach until last two weeks ( my baby 8lbs . 8oz . ) they really small . i put cream my breasts abdomen every day after shower , but because it expensive i skipped my sides ( love handle area ) get stretchmarks there which darker than ones my stomach . since my stomach gone down , ones my stomach very light probably go away enough satisfy my ego . i highly recommend giving mustela cream chance	1
i'm 18 ! well you think what 18 this cream . i don't any wrinkle . my skin really good until i get into college . my eyes become really tired i start lot dark circle plus puffiness . after reading recommendation fashion magazine , which says everybody every age need eye cream . ok , fine , i get one . i chose one got highest rate ! overall quality , it very good moisturize my eye area . this means it easier apply foundation/concealer/eye makeup . but my puff still here . i still dark circle ! no reducing ! i know i need better schedule enough sleep but still , i expected higher this product . size , small little teeny tiny one good enough you use months . usually i use it night . when i apply concealer , i apply time .	1
i looking high low fragrance wasn't strong . i tried so many perfumes body sprays it ridiculous . i finally found one i use more than week . i love it ! smell so clean simple . first day i wore it i 3 seperate people tell me i smelled good . i never even one person tell me , let alone 3 . i amazed . also , i noticed they told me i smelled good . they didn't say your perfume smells good . i am not sure how describe smell . it reminds me out-of-the-shower fresh smell we wish we could all day . i never use any other fragrances but philosophy fragrances . i plan trying all their other wonderful scents well	1

" i looked saw nothing but it felt good she kinda high pressure so i bought it . when i got car looked myself i could see definite improvement . skin under my eyes tighter , it still dark under my eye but without all baggage it much improved . so i think if i use this product put my concealer over it i am going notice huge difference . highly recommended	1

when i little girl , i would watch my mother take her makeup off her dressing table . cold cream soft cloth tissues . gentle misting water then dabbing cloth . then night cream , eye cream ( " dab gently , never rub " ) , special lotion her throat collarbone area . she would impart her beauty secrets me while i sat transfixed . although i convinced she most beautiful woman world , i surprised all these lotions oils , she didn't ' slide right out bed night . " exercise , sweetheart . drink lots water . never go sleep your makeup -- no matter how tired you . never wash your face regular soap . moisturize , moisturize , moisturize . your skin last you lifetime nothing gives away woman age like uncared skin . " while i am not sure where i would even find ' cold cream ' today , i follow vast majority her regimen . two items i use under my eyes avon repair eye serum hydrofirming bio6 eye cream . cream plumps up firms delicate tissue around eye , serum smoothes moisturizes skin . i consider avon products unsung work horses beauty industry . they almost always exactly what they say they going very modest price . expensive boutique department store products rarely better job usually exorbitantly overpriced . when you factor avon products go sale regularly ( which when i usually stock up ) , you getting even better deal your money . while i am not complete cheapskate , i love bargain i want feel like i am getting full value my money . skin around eyes quite thin delicate , so i think if you follow my mother advice " dab gently , never rub " avon repair eye serum hydrofirming bio6 eye cream you able keep this area smooth , without greasy , even most drying climatic conditions	1

( although i agree numbered adjustment seems perform little differently depending blade used . ) it easy keep clean -- assuming you don't mind unscrewing it taking blade out wipe off head frame . also used venerable old gillette " fat boy " 1950s , i'd still rate progress better razor ; screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable , not just steps . since this safety razor , its performance significantly dependent blades used . i've tried both merkur blades japanese " feather " blades , would say it toss-up . since it adjustable safety razor , it perfectly suited two-pass close shaving . higher setting excellent first pass grain beard , lower setting pass against grain . adjustment also allows you adjust razor conditions your skin beard . if you've let yourself get day worth stubble ( c'mon--don't we all ? ) you set blade high mow hedge . if you need quick clean-up before night town , you set it lower " once lightly , james .

i bought laura mercier kit : mini glaces six glaces including : champagne glace , rose glace , bare beige glace , ambre rose glace , petal glace violet glace . my favorite rose , but all colors very beautiful . i also full size melon , my favorites . while colors beautiful , provide lots shine long wearing , they very sticky . mac lip glass much stickier , so if you don't mind , they might right you . also , good thing kit you get try lots different colors , but tubes quite small , steep price . so , if you willing put up sticky gloss high price tag exchange some most beautiful colors , this might right gloss you .	1

i some dry bumpy bits top my arms resistant any scrubby product i've ever tried use , but buffy got my skin so smooth ! amazing , highly recommended . soak tub/shower/whatever so hot water softens up your skin , then scrub away . small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses ; large twice big . small one more reasonably priced people who just want sample stuff . this thing lots great little scrubby bits it . ground rice , ground almonds , adzuku beans . not just one , but three , they all super-scrubby . you'll little red when you're , but it so worth it once you've cooled off your skin smooth baby bottom . only downside it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into bottom it once thing drains . bar melts around ' hot water ' temperature , you're not supposed use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't ! moisturizing oils bar really work very well . i'll definitely picking up couple more these . cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent really amazing well . soothing refreshing , it wake you up morning or calm you down night before you go sleep . definitely try this thing , though , if you're looking ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing	1

i this product working my hair right now . it simply wonderful ! first off , it smells like lovely victorian rosebud-almond pudding . it similar consistency . i get three four uses each container i very thick hair . my hair preciously quite dry abused . i dyed it twice last six months . after one use this product my hair felt better than it years . silky , strong shiny . i love this product ! i highly recommend it .	1
this treatment works extremely well ! i looked here saw there no extrememly helpful reviews , so i decided write one . i long , golden , untreated hair . however it dry straw so i decided try this . here how it : smell amazing ( it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies ) after use hair looks soft shiny , however it makes hair flat . this product deep moisturizer therefore hair not any " pouf " it . it still worth money though ! rehydration hair supremely important this rehydrates well . just after shampooing not use conditioner ( unless just doesn't work well you ) , which helps flatness . few helpful tips : 1 . this goes dry hair2 . after putting lots this treatment , try putting bag over your hair keeping it shut clip . heat your head produces allows hair cuticles open fully absorb treatment . this works 2xs better than lush intstructions ( my mother hairstylist ) . 3 . leave bag tight around your head 20 40 minutes4 . afterwards shampoo like normal , but i still recommend not using conditioner day . hopefully this helps anyone questions . this really amazing product should used twice month ( more if you'd like but that probably not necessary ) . enjoy your beatiful shiny hair !	1
first spray , this pretty potent cologne , but after 1-2 minutes this fades into nice rosey spice scent much lighter than it green original polo brother . lasts all day long into night . worth checking out if you fan cool water lotto , or lighter scented cologne .	1
i love these inserts ! i trouble finding ones this size . not too big , not too small . they definitely help me fill out my bras ! i would suggest putting them bras pockets inserts . i tried just setting these my bra , but if i moved my arms up my bra moved around , i afraid cupcakes would fall out . these great product though	1
but it definitally not work it intended . it intended moisturize hair . i long , fine , oily hair , i received trichomania gift . i love smell , but when i first used it , it left my hair very dry which i consider good thing considering state my hair . it just didnt what it supposed . however , if you really oily hair , this thing you . no problems lathering either , especally if you rub bar your hair , not your hands . doesnt leave white flakes either	1
i first smelled this perfume colleague mine , year ago . every time she walked me i got whiff this heavenly scent she wore nearly every day . so , i finally stopped her asked what she wearing . i'd never heard it , so i jumped online looked it up , found bottle bought it . i couldn't wait try it out , so when perfume finally arrived i put it right . imagine my disappointment when i smelled scent totally unlike one i'd experienced . me it overpoweringly musky , nothing like seductive fragrance i'd smelled my colleague . but , odd thing happened . i didn't wash it right off , when i smelled it again 30 minutes later it become alluringly sensual perfume i'd fallen love . fact , longer i wore it better it smelled . obviously it depends your body chemistry achieve it bloom . now , i wear it when i go out evenings , people comment how wonderfully sexy it smells . if you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly , i .... give it little time you're sure love it . you only need use little , it lasts hours .	1
i very fine hair this one products thickens without weighing hair down . it leaves hair soft not stiff yet easy style keep hold	1

i searched far wide product aids treatment/management keratosis pilaris ( little red bumps backs my arms ) . it estimated 40-50% population form keratosis pilaris there no cure skin condition . however , this neostrata aha 8 significantly reduced bumps redness after only 2 weeks . after 4 weeks , it almost vanished . only drawback after 2-3 weeks non-use bumps tend resurface . but , if you keep application up , bumps stay away ! i use it religiously over summer or if i any upcoming special occasions where i want look my best . i found product self magazine , suggesting its use keratosis pilaris management nothing but rave reviews !! finally , something works	1
i've using murad 3 weeks now , it made huge difference ! i am my early 20 problems mild breakouts since my teens . i've tried drugstore products , wich never seemed make any difference , proactive which so harsh it actually burned made my skin much worse . murad gentle enough me use twice day , left my skin breakout free ! it also improved texture feel my skin , makes my pores nearly invisible . i recomend murad anyone whose skin breakout prone but too sensitive benzoyle peroxide formulas other acne products . only complaint i murad price - it little much poor college student - but results worth it if you afford it !	1
i love this product . it takes only few drops make my hair shine . it light , smells quite nice not all overpowering or strong smelling . i don't buy cheap fragrances , so i don't know what " bad perfumes " reviewer nycoleb comparing this . i suppose everyone body chemistry different . i haven't found any other product what this so i'll buying bottle when this one	1

i am big fan this product . my hair very strong . it needs product which keep it tamed . however , most products level strength also come high sheen or gloss which , my opinion , bad look today fashions . matte look more flexible . american crew fiber gives me pliability matte look very strong hold . it also smells nice .... not strong not too girly	1
i love using jonathan product . it makes your hair feel soft , look beautiful products smell great .	1

i moved area city water ( which i not used ) , not too long ago . i noticed my hair skin seemed turn dull gray after some time . no matter what hair skin products i tried using , result same . after reading this product health magazine , i decided give it shot since it received such high praise . i am thrilled my purchase ! i saw almost instant results . my skin never felt softer . filter system itself very easy install required no tools . anyone harsh , chlorine laden city water , i highly recommend this product	1

( but photos you can't really see this , but it felt nasty ! ) so . wash your hair . well . condition . towel dry . apply sparingly . like touch . smooth into hair . it not rocket science . if you need little more later , add little more	1
high beam nice subtle highlighter . however , sure blend it very quickly well or it look unnatural certain lighting ( it'll look like you pink nail polish your face ) . it also tendency emphasize pores . so only use it areas your face where you don't any , like top cheek bone under your eyebrows .	1
i used similar product compact chanel paid $50 . it wasn't too long before i saw end it either . now benenfit high beam i get effect less than half price so i'm happy customer . i put this my cheek bone brush blush over it glimmery , dewy cheeks . it very youthful look . it not unnatural but it better than natural . it supernatural . since i started wearing it people don't know exactly what i've added but they comment my skin looks particuliarly good . you control highlighting effect how much you use but i like use generous amount . my skin really beam .	1
i'll admit , well receded hair line i still tried get what left manageable look good - everything else i've used left my hair dry , flaked off or didn't hold . jonathan dirt solved this long-term issue me just first few days use . dirt provides manageability , hold look i've strived even smells great its almond scent . i recommend this without reservation	1

what wrong everyone reviewing these products ? this your hair scalp , not face . again , after experimenting few times , if it doesn't work , just say so state facts , not hype your feelings jonathan his show television	1
after reading other reviews i little worried using product i already ordered . after using it few days now my hair never looked better , i truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner meant me . i fine , super straight hair , middle short . it feels clean sleek . conditioner smells like pina coloda , yum ! i would definatly recommend this my hair type . would maybe recommend lather shampoo your hands first then work thoroughly ( it doesn't lather well some shampoos lots glycerine them ) only apply conditioner towards end your hair leave few min . hope helps	1
i purchased these gloves not moisturizing my hands , but protect them when i'm driving or riding my bike sun . my main concern they would heavy or clumsy , but they fit like second skin , lightweight , grip well , extremely comfortable . i wear them hours time without noticing i them , so i imagine they would easy sleep . they wash like dream . definitely buy more	1
exuding citrusy aromas , still life bath bomb smells glorious . bath bombs made sodium bicarbonate , so they're like " alka seltzers " bath . some lush bath bombs contain petals other plant parts still life no exception . mine filled sunflower petals -- even complete flower leaf ! although bathing such bath bombs luxurious , clean up quite messy . ( when my husband came into bathroom while i bathing , he exclaimed " what heck ?! " why , it sunflower petals , my dear ... ) i first rate mess my hands after bath . i keep clearing drain water go down . then i it few more times before i could finally rinse tub ! if you don't mind lush bath bombs include petals other flora fauna -- you love bright , citrusy scents--you'll likely love still life bath bomb . it smells heavenly , tints water golden hue . however , if you don't like plant parts floating your bath -- nor clean up involved afterwards -- steer clear still life	1

i love love love love blackberry bath bomb !!!!! it turned my bath water very pretty purple color smell wonderful ! i can't really describe it . it didn't smell fruity me all but very relaxing soothing . once i got out tub smell stayed my skin several hours . when i putting my daughter bed she snuggled her head my arm just kept smelling . we both laid there smelling my arms :)	1
this bath bomb not really smell like blackberry ; nonetheless , it sweet , fruity smell i cannot quite place my finger . it smells bit like grape kool-aid , but not sweet or syrupy . smell not strong some lush other bath bombs , but it quite pleasan t.t he bomb turns bath water wonderfully relaxing purple color . most bath bombs lush , it leave ring around tub . order remedy this , i usually wipe tub down my washcloth after i am my bath . granted , this not way one wants cap off relaxing bath , but it save agony scrub tub following morning . bomb turns water quite soft leave your skin feeling delightfully supple . i quite pleased this aspect bomb . scent it leaves your skin subtle lasted couple days . this definitely one lush more simple bath bombs , but it definitely not boring . small surprise accompanies bomb somewhat compensates lack glitter more powerful floral/fruit scent . not one more memorable bombs , but really quite pleasing . if you want take break some lush more overpowering products , this bomb you .	1
i received 100 tiny bottles this neighbor ... thought it worth shot . i'm 27 problems breakouts since i young teenager . idealist made my skin baby soft , reduced number breakouts much better than clearasil or any other anti-acne treatment , also evened out my complexion ... i less blotchiness . i absolutely love this stuff ! but alas , i used up all little bottles i just can't seem get myself pay $40 or more it ... even much it worked . i just wish it wasn't expensive	1
rock star creamy pink soap produces abundance lather . i've found it less drying than many other soaps , less drying than certain lush other soaps ( glycerin ones , like bohemian sea vegetable . ) while creaminess certainly asset , it also means soap melts away quickly , reviewer mentioned . this somewhat expensive soap , more than $7 3 oz ., this definitely something consider before purchasing . bar this soap lasts me week , showering every day . admittedly i'm fairly enthusiastic user , it likely possible use bit less , but i'm not sure would make huge difference . this brings us scent . if you like sweet , candy-like scents , rock star amazing . it very sweet , very pink , very girly . overall , this lovely candy scent ( same lush creamy candy bubble bar ) . it bit hard scent explain , but very much sweet candy-like . overall , this lovely , luxurious soap . it also expensive soap . these main benefits/drawbacks . i gave it 5 stars because i love scent texture	1
this perfume smells so good . it not too overbearing but it not wear off easily either . it sort sweet light . i got sample macy i finished it asap now i need bottle ! i love it	1
i loved this bath bomb but it doesn't lot " pow " so if that what you looking , go elsewhere this one . middle hidden surprise which i like - tea bag . i didn't think scent all strong water wasn't exceptionally softer but it ok experience . i don't know i'd get it again though	1
this one my favorite perumes . very romantic .. just name implies . scent woman would wear sexy night out her man .. or wear when getting married !! reminds me soft pink roses .... but not overwhemlingmy " rose-y " .... which good .	1
i tried just every over counter face wash available . i found flaw each one they either dried my face out too much , or irratated my face , or just didnt clean my face enough . this cleanser perfect answer ! it fragrant free , doesnt dry out your face . pha gently exfoilates dead skin cells no scrubbing leaves face smooth fresh . it absolute must those us oily acne prone skin . my dermatologist reccomended it me year ago , i never go back anything else again	1
this great great eyeliner ! i quest find eyeliner last whole day without smuding or clumping corners my eyes i found it ! it not too pricey , either . if they ever discontinue this product , i'll very sad camper ..... it great	1
i acne since age 12 , though it never severe , i hate it . i've tried lots over counter products various prices , this first stuff i've used works . however , ( this huge however ) like most companies philosophy assumes acne prone skin always oily skin . this not so . my skin very dry sensitive , even areas where i am most likely break out . i notice when i bought kit it likely strip oil my skin , but i assumed moisturizing would help . not so . acne cleared up nicely , but now i sizable ( me anyway ) flaking patch next one my eyebrows . i using aveno moisturizer after h202 cream , blemish syrum only once day ( sparingly ) but i am now going try philosophy hope jar sensitive skin put it after everything . hopefully ( no pun intended ) this help	1
my hair looks great after i straighten it . but once i put little bit chi silk infusion it , it amazingly soft silky ! i can't stop touching it hours afterwards . it smells great too . you try it	1
while sephora planning buy fantasy britney spears i came across armani code . it kinda hard miss since there this gigantic poster advertising it . so i thought there no harm testing it right ?? i sprayed little bit test strip fell love it . it smells amazing !!!! it mainly smells like lavendar me which one my favorite scent . it lasts maybe 4 hours so if you go school or work you might need 1 or 2 refreshes . i spray 2 squirts each . also days you want try something different i recommand pink sugar aquolina miracle intense lancome	1
i always wanted try ojon restorative treatment i finally bought it . my hair never looked or felt so good years . i color my hair use flat iron several times week so it so so dry . i put it last night left it overnight . i also got shampoo conditioner once i started brushing my wet hair i could tell this stuff good . i never buy anything other than ojon again . truely it best	1
coverage great if you playsticks ! it great foundation goes nicely	1
this only foundation i ever use . i very oily skin large pores . my main problem 3 4 hours after i put other foundations , my face would so incredibly shiny it gross . superfit not . it also doesn't make my skin break out . additionally , it exact color match . i brown skin finding exact color match very difficult me . i use " nutty " . only problem i this foundation why i didn't give it 5 stars fact it rub off your clothing . so careful , those you , who apply makeup before putting clothing .	1
i nothing but positive things say this face mask ! it very refreshing makes my skin feel smooth refreshed . it also keeps blemishes acne under control , so less breakouts	1
ever think how much time most us spend taking care our skin ? we use potions , creams , masks our faces keep complexions glowing but often neglect our hair save quick shampoo blow dry . then , all sudden , we look mirror realize these tresses need treatment ! let face it , blow drying , hot rollers , curling irons , coloring , sun all take their toll even healthiest heads . hair mask shea butter both treat treatment dry , lifeless , lusterless hair . shea butter , course , key ingredient , working its magic restore lackadaisical locks . it simple - work palm size dollop through damp hair leave up 20 minutes . then shampoo rinse hair well . i'd also recommend using fekkai apple cider clearing rinse . results immediate - what difference you'll see feel . - gail cook	1
this great either face powder soak up shine over your foundation , or summer light foundation . i purchased before again it one my favorite powders . very silky	1
i these rice paper blotters these far my favorite not only they blot oil but they add bit powder keep my makeup looking fresh . don't leave home without	1

this product great , i love it . unfortunately , i bought wrong color . it make my eyebrows look entirely too dark . it really hard see what color online , i couldn't decide which color buy . so i bought dark blonde color , go back get pale blonde one . if your hair two colors , go lighter one	1
philosophy amazing grace 4 piece pampering gift set fantastic way try new product line without expense purchasing full size bottles . i love this fragance , it light , delicate very feminine . scent lasts all day . i would highly recommend these items	1
sadly i bought this product because i heard jennifer lopez uses it , i no idea if truth but i wanted it anyway . i live uk , so delivery took three weeks , said , wait worth it . i am twenty five bad crows feet , due late nights alcohol plenty , so i really need something help me out . after few days applying day night i could tell lines softened , enough make me feel good . dark circles under my eyes looking lighter well so that bonus . i dont think this going make my lines dissapear but they hardly noticeable anymore . cost product doesn'y seem steep cream last ages , i only use tiny drop it twice size normal eye cream you buy . overall i am more than pleased result i definately purchasing more , when time comes .	1
i received sample this sephora , when i bought fekkai product . i couldn't believe it when i tried it . it wonderful , it smells great(my boyfriend loved it ) , it got my hair really clean left it soft some body , not limp greasy feeling . i only use fekkai products now , they really best your hair	1

i am 41 years old . i using this product 3 months other creams . i very little lines my face my age . no lines around eyes either . this product seems help . anything look little younger	1
like many other oil strips , this locks up all oil your face without removing any makeup . this perfect those oily skin like mine , who need blot often . although i'm sure there cheaper brands would same , when you blot these sheets it seems last longer than others i used . check out your sephora stores , sometimes they sell them 2 $10	1
i'm extremely picky my fragrance worn same fragrance 25 years . i received sample this immediately loved it . now i'm addict . i use fragrance , lotion , body wash	1
this hair oil amazing ! my hair severely damaged bleaching , dying , chemical straightening , heat styling . i've tried everything cheap store brands salon products repair my dry , brittle hair ; but nothing made any real difference until now . philosophy marinating oil brought my hair back life ! after just one use it softer , smoother , less dry , much , much heathier looking . i using it month now my hair looks better than it before i started dying straightening it . this product worth money	1
i only used clinique eye shadows so happy them . i've tried different brands always come back this one . they great colors it lasts all day without creasing or looking too " powdery " .	1
zeno works ! it simple . hold device new forming pimple - zap ! - it gone . it usually reduces size immediately completely gone 24 hrs - really remarkable . also - no chemicals - important me . i hope this company goes public - i've never seen anything like it - so no competition ! use it loose it - pimples - i mean	1
i purchased this comb hopes it would gentle enough my fine hair reduce hair loss breakage . after showering , i comb through my towel-dryed hair prior styling . this comb detangles well , although process much easier if i've used good conditioner . i still experience lot hair loss , so i'm not sure if comb helped this area , but my breakage combing appears minimal . overall , i'm happy this product , which performed well almost 5 years daily usage	1
this powder great . it great coverage without looking cakey . i also sensitive skin this never bothered me . only reason i gave it 4 stars because it still little dark very light skin it needs " touched-up " little more often than other powders i've tried , but it worth it	1
i got mini bottle cinnamon buns philosophy.com order , i surprised how much i liked , since i'm not huge cinnamon fan . i use 3-in1 when i travel , i find it depends local water whether or not i need extra conditioner , so i bring bottle leave conditioner me . philosophy shower gels really nice job not drying out my already dryish skin , my hair always super shiny when i use philosophy 3-in 1 . said , this one best smelling philosophy shower gels , if you're looking deal , qvc sells 32oz several philosopy shower gels ( including cinnamon buns ) $22.00 $24.0	1
if you're looking best scissortweezers , look no further . construction impeccable feel very solid . i went thru other brands makes came across sephora own model - very bad . they sell tweezerman products , but they not sell this particular model due fact they sell their own flimsy alternative . not substitute this other products . price unbelievably expensive , but once you get hold it you understand . you only buy it once this last more than lifetime	1
this product described anti-ager , but i've noticed year or so i've used it works wonders any number skin imperfections . it moisturizing but not all greasy . it dramatically reduced my breakouts noticeably evened out skin tone my chin . it contains ingredient " help minimize facial hair growth " since using it i've able reduce my number lip waxes . it very little scent easy smooth . if i one suggestion make , it would philosophy sell it larger bottles one bottle generally only lasts me month .	1
i tried ( disappointed ) several make-up primers ( sephora , philosophy , etc . ) when i decided try this . i very oily skin large pores around my nose my forehead but using this product tinted moisturizer makes my skin look naturally perfect ! my skin stays shine-free well into afternoon ( i still end up using blotting tissues- it says you use this one top make-up , but applying it causes smearing)overall , i couldn't happier	1
i always thin hair . my hair scalp left shambles after temporary round antibiotics . i decided once again use this product restore my hair . my hair scalp better condition than ever before . this product perfect " fix this mess " syndrome .	1
resolution feels wonderfully luxurious skin relatively economical you need only little your whole face neck - regular size pot lasts me two months . it leaves you super soft feeling " pampered " skin , you apply makeup rightaway . promised anti-wrinkle effect , i am not too sure . i think great deal effect kind temporary plumping or masking wrinkles immediately after application which fades after couple hours , especially makeup . but overall , i think it helps keep skin somehow glowing i am quite satisfied this nice quality day night cream someone my age ( slightly younger-looking 37 ) . maybe i should also mention i am quite prone allergies sensitive reactions haven't noticed any adversities this products two years use	1
i bought this my husband father day . he loves it	1
smelled like coconuts , but what kept it sweetness , it kind ends up falling off bit musk . i would've preferred if it didn't musk mixed . musk unbalances sweetness it	1
i love this product can't recommend it highly enough , especially if you love margaritas . i love whole 3 1 idea : however , i sensitive skin very dry hair so i only use it bath gel . unless you normal , perpetually shiny hair perfect skin i would look elsewhere hair face products	1
it smells really good took long time fizz away . it good rainy dreary day . water also turned yellow orange color .	1
even though this scrub reminds me teenage days , when skin would act if it attacked my own face , trying get away , i still love using it fight occasional blemishes . there nothing this mighty warrior cannot when it comes cleansing purging skin clogged pores dry patches . i don't suggest treating face like floor , scrubbing away until polish wears off , but good scrub least once week normal oily skin not only beneficial but also very relaxing let me just say scent itself makes me feel healthier all ready . i still get this , not only because my fond memories but it ability perk up refresh my skin , especially before mask sunday night right before bed . i love fresh piney scent scrub its creamy consistency marred real ground tea leaves . tea tree found parts south east asia , new zealand australia . small shrub survive places where other vegetation fails flourish . there over hundred eighty species tea tree , only oil steam-distilled single species melaleuca alternifolia used commercially it only found northern new south wales . since it discovery oil called first aid kit bottle , not used moisturizer but deep cleanser antiseptic it also used treat pimples , burns , stings , toot aches , gum infections various other unpleasant occurrences . without cleansing scrubs , skin would take twenty five days wear off , not mention daily doses makeup , pollution , smoke , mixture sebum dead skin , dust , dirt collect top , they trap healthy layers promote patches redness irritation , not mention breakouts unhealthy environment one part our bodies represents us so well definitely bad idea . scrubs such tea tree oil one not only natural but also gentle enough not harm over strip skin when used accordingly skin type user . get most scrub , quick steam bath also very nice ; i cover my head clean towel lean over bowl hot water some chamomile tea it five minutes . i don't put my face too close avoid getting my skin burned but it very relaxing great pore opener before scrub mask . - kasia .	1

if you thick hair , or long hair , or both i , then this towel you . it seems little pricey just one towel , but believe me , it completely worth it . i hair hangs four inches below where my bra crosses my back it quite thick . after ten minutes regular towel turban , my hair still drips profusely . after ten minutes aquis towel , outer surface my hair almost dry touch ! not mention towel holds turban perfectly - normal towels so heavy i must keep my head upright keep turban place . aquis , i bend over or swing my head around turban not come undone or fall off . i don't like use hair dryers because it extremely damaging your hair ; acquis , there less need because my hair half dry after few minutes it . also , i've noticed my hair lot more volume when i dry it aquis . i could see how people thin or very short hair would not get full benefit this towel because normal towel works well enough them ; but if you lot hair , this towel just like magic	1

( i able mask almost indetectable difference two sides this morning when i put my makeup using just teeny bit brown powder wax ... i live texas even humidity powder stayed put not smudge ! ) overall , this not snap use , but definitely worth effort , i even got compliments my brows my coworkers who thought i them professionally . i bought this kit price my brows waxed twice salon . i am very happy purchase would highly recommend it	1

ive tried all supposed best moment , breakthrough skin care , anti-aging , anti-wrinkle products past 5 yrs , i just keep going back la mer . i use other products least six months reap their full benefits , honestly , my skin looks its most radiant best when im back la mer . i just stopped trying out other products now since its only la mer brings best results . my skin always looks radiant dewey . terms wrinkle improvement , there only cosmetic change due fact your skin look moist , which lessens appearance lines . lines pronounced when skin dry , thus all moisturizers work keeping skin moist which gives you illusion less lines . but this product truly best among all !!! nothing else	1

i'm recent convert lush products i say i'm thrilled find this new shampoo . i started using this couple days ago i've noticed positive difference my hair . my hair wasn't total mess using silicone shampoos , but now i've changed brands i see potential my hair i didn't even know it . i shoulder length really thick hair few waves curls . i don't too much problem tangling begin . all i needed couple swipes down my hair this lather right up . it smells awesome shower . lush describes it oranges bowl spices ; i'm not so sure but it definately smells kind foresty nice . it rinsed off very well hot water i followed jungle conditioner . hours later day i stil smell komba shampoo wafting around my head . it amazing . i've never shampoo stick me like this my hair feels light shiny just clean . no matter how much i try clean regular shampoo my hair it seems weigh it down . my boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less " poofy " . this just amazing . i would reccomend keeping shampoo airtight container . keeping it shelf where any water hit it deteriorate its longevity . i keep mine very tiny tupperwear container shower . size bar small , but it go loooooong way .	1
i bought fantasy gift set ( fragrance , body souffl� jewellery box ) , wasn't really interested souffl� . i sensitive skin suffer migraines , so careful which products i use . but curiosity got better me , so i gave it try . non-shimmering lotion melted into my skin immediately - no stinging or rashes . fantasy scent - chocolate , cupcake , lychee , quince kiwi - subtle enough not overpower me , yet strong enough people comment my wonderful fragrance .

first i hesitant ante up $ purchase dermanew system , but after few friends raved it , i decided buy i t.t he system includes battery operated applicator tool ( batteries included ) , sponge tops tool , dermabrasion cream . you pop sponge top applicator , put cream it apply your dampened skin . i set timer 3 minutes work applicator around surface my skin . results great ! dead skin sloughed off , circulation stimulated results glowing soft skin . my skin looks lovely feels smooth touch . it felt soft wonderful after very first application ! dermanew sells other applicator sponges creams separately use applicator tool your hands fee t.t hough initial price tag seems high , this tool last years help you glowing skin ! i highly recommend it	1

... but i didn't care smell . it smell like beer i could smell it throughout day after i used it ( smell fades throughout day ) , but i guess if you like smell this shampoo , then it won't problem all . notice my hair shinier softer(which hard say my hair ) , but knock off star scent . cynthia sylvia stout shampoo just `okay ' i sticking rehab , big , i love juicy ( see my reviews ) . try smaller size bottle first , remember some products lush store smells different when you get them home	1
i bought this several other philosphy 3-in-1 products totally based their yummy smell , this probably my favorite ! it truly smells like melting strawberry milkshake made fresh strawberries whole milk ice cream . i never get tired smell ! i admit i only used this body wash , not shampoo or conditioner . i found combination products not work well my dry curly hair , so i cannot attest hair cleaning properties this product . i say i've using philosphy products my skin year , i love them . i found my skin slightly less dry since i switched my old product . i ( i've heard many others say this same thing ) found fragrance not linger strongly your skin after your shower . my husband never smells my flavor du jour my skin after my shower , i am glad , because i don't think strawberries clinique happy go well together . so if you concerned smelling like you stepped out dairy queen , don't	1

" burberry weekend , " she replied , her face melted into confident , self-satisfactory smile woman who knows she something woman wants . i excitedly told my husband what happened day , i am hoping he buy me some this incredible fragrance christmas .	1
this summer i using neutrogena tanning mousse medium . allure gave neutrogena product great review . i like it because like this product , it gives instant color while also including chemical develops tan over hours . however , i bleach my bath towels get out leftover mousse my legs after i get out shower night ( if i don't it gets my sheets . ) also , you work quickly your hands spread mousse before it streaks . then you clean it your fingernails . i tried this modelco spray sephora today . it goes very evenly , no hand blending needed . it lighter than medium neutrogena , which great bec i am very fair skinned . much easier apply , but costs lot more . i'll prob use it weekends because you spray all those hard reach areas . during week when i'm just doing my legs i'll stick cheaper neutrogena product .	1

burberry brit one my staple fragrances ... i'm my third bottle which my mother thankfully supplied me christmas this year . brit deep , warm vanilla amber scent , but it not sweet . it rich oh-so-slightly woody , creamy undertone . it fairly long-lasting too . if , like me , you're not big florals , you'll appreciate brit spicy amber glow . i don't find it particularly strong , but then my tastes fragrance run strong side ( long it not overpowering ) . i know i'll love this one years come .	1
i searched great perfume many years , finally found it ! burberry brit sexy , yet not overpowering . both men women attracted smell , i suggest smelling it vogue then ordering several bottles before it out stock	1
we lose so much time over it - you know what i'm talking , you debaters scissors . tweezers - but god told me tell y'all rest your souls . thusly : proper nasal care only accomplished tweezers . yes , there pain . but pain holy child vanity , whom we must bow down	1
i amazon reward certificate looking something practical use it . it so happened i needed new tweezers . i read reviews thought i'd give these try . wow , i can't believe difference quality any other tweezers i ever owned . they almost seem adhere whatever your trying grasp . it so easy precisely almost painlessly remove even finest eyebrow hair . tweezerman tweezers rock !	1

i purchased 07 sheer caramel , which pretty accurate description color ( warm medium brown ) . it very natural beautiful shade . it sheer name implies , but there still good amount color . smell pleasant sweet , smooth light texture . it coverage lipstick moisture gloss , without sticky . it kind like tinted lip balm , but color more substantial . it actually feels better my lips than balm . appearance semi-glossy , but not goopy looking like traditional gloss . there little bit sparkle , but it not chunky like glitter . i would prefer it not any sparkle all , which my only complaint ( why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 ) . i think formula shiny enough it doesn't need any added glimmer effect . honestly , i think cosmetics manufacturers gone overboard putting glitter virtually everything . enough already ! anyway , i still like this lipstick despite my sparkle hang-up . it packaged slim silver tube very chic , simple , easy apply .	1
happy heart - even better than original happy which bit more citrusy . i use it day or night . roll-on applicator great idea it small enough purse yet lasts lasts . it doesn't leak cap doesn't fall off either . even better , it doesn't seem trigger attacks my allergic friends .

this cologne very spicy perhaps one my favorites next burberry fragrance men . whereas burberry fragrance fruity , brit slightly different scent more floral certainly more spicy ( yet not heavy or complex london ) . something spicy i'm quite surprised how light this one comes across ( comparison london which just little too heavy me ) . i agree other reviewers say it still far very masculine indeed . vanilla immediately noticed , well more fruity undertones which only increase time passes ( " juicy green mandarin , " perhaps but you need poet sense it ... again , admittedly sweet ) . warning , this product not nearly citrus/lemon/orange burberry fragrance ; instead it follows london footsteps provides spiciness yet more minimal way . worn similar fashion , either formal affairs or casual ones , though i'd gather it selected most often casual ones ( i find similarity this chanel allure , yet i find allure much more pungent ... i love allure , but if you want something little more mellow night , this your product ) . sweet , spicy , deep complex brit marks itself my second favorite burberry line - sharing spot right top burberry fragrance ! worn daily without becoming tiring , feature which i think it holds over burberry fragrance whose citrus-sweet fragrance may become annoyance	1
this stuff great when my skin needs some hardcore moisturizing . it might feel greasy some , but when your skin very dry , it not like . if you feel it too heavy day wear , it work great nighttime treatment . it sort smells like oatmeal vanilla ice cream me	1
my skin horrible ! since i started using this product i feel my pores much smaller ... overall color my skin more radiant , my skin feels amazing . other words , my skin soft noticeably different . after one use , i felt immediate results	1
this great alternative clumpy , mascara clear mascara - it middle those two . it thin doesn't clump all , nice moist , quick drying . no smell , good my sensitive eyes contacts . it doesnt much besides darken lashes , though , nothing fancy , it come off if wetted/rubbed . it won't run down your face , but it won't survive good cry	1
i love this product . it smooths beautifully . you don't ever feel like you makeup but it gives just right amount coverage helps nourish protect your skin . i also love growing manafacturing practices this company . i would recommend it anyone	1
even cold midwestern weather i oily skin that prone breakouts this great product oily skin . it cleans removes makeup but doesn't feel though it stripped my skin all moisture . it little pricey but it worth it you'll great skin doesn't still feel oily , or feel too dry , after you wash your face	1
chanel aqualumiere lipstick , my opinion , best lipstick formula market . lipstick goes shiny lipgloss but texture lip balm . colors , though sheer , still good pigmentation ; sheerness actually benefit because it allows lipstick color blend well your natural lip color , lessening chance your lip color come out looking unnatural . aqualumiere line lipsticks need reapplied more often than less sheer lipstick , but lasting power still relatively high , reapplication less bother because lipstick texture . though i not tried all colors , pinks this formula -- waikiki particular -- strike me especially natural face-brightening	1

i received this scent(the mid-sized white bottle)for christmas 2006 . it beautiful ! really warm , vanilla-ish scent lingers forever incredibly comforting sexy hell . this little much office or casual wear , but i definitely think it would go over well evening or date-i've found guys respond pretty well it . also-the packaging exquisite . bottles solid fuschia , white , or orange shaped like decorative bud vase . i love box scent came , white some sort pink orange bird it . i liked it so much i actually store perfume box rather than throw it away . really , really special product	1

it very delicate . not irritate skin . complexion looks improved after 2 or 3 times using it . my friends notice difference skin gloves . it not easy wash it off you get lot hydrogen foam vs only few enzyme tablets(little minus ) , not work toward acne but i'm still happy it	1
this truly best . it not burden senses , it enlightens them .	1
it hard find this product online places you'd think it would like sephora.com, gloss.com or neiman marcus.com . i am very happy found my favorite moisturizer amazon.com so now i don't brave crowds brick mortar sephora or , let say saks fifth avenue where they hawk you like carnival barkers . even sephora salespeople become more aggressive than their original philosophy letting customer browse uninterrupted . this moisturizer perfect if you hate anything greasy your skin . it light , yet truly moisturizes least sticky stinky any i've ever tried . if you even get one or 2 pimples other moisturizers , you won't worry using this one . great oily or combination skin . i'm forty i still love it ! anything else slides off or makes me break out . only annoying thing my boyfriend uses most it	1

i add mild color my hair " caca marron " henna , i like use this shampoo conjunction henna treatment . i feel like it helps color set gives it good depth . reincarnate itself not add color but add shine ( most lush solids seem this me) ! solid shampoos intimidating if you never used them before , but lush makes experience fun easy . little bit this bar rubbed into your hair creates nice lather leaves your hair feeling fresh clean . solid shampoo also good travel , it doesn't spill or explode all over your luggage	1

after developing contact dermatitis makeup sample , i needed pure natural moisturizer would not aggravate condition . olivella night moisturizer perfect solution i'm now customer life	1
i reluctant get this one because it one few i already familiar ole high school days , many same reasons other reviewer stated , it around long time many already good or bad associations scent other guys who worn it . i understand why he gave it three stars , but i'm here review it based its scent merits not pop-culture story surrounds it . fact , guy laroche nailed almost perfect scent right eve fragrance men explosion . while its polo green counterpart tended smell more me like pesticide bottle , this cologne both decidedly masculine decidedly beautiful same time . it elegance blatant animalism . it musky spicy without floral or citrusy . age popularity generation ( zeroing age ) associated it probably prevent me overusing it , but it still ranks very high scent tests woman , possibly continuing best fragrance out there . synthetic scent other reviewer mentioned , this probably last made before manipulation benzene aromatics very common most newer colognes he probably likes lot . most likely its lack organic citrus notes caused statement . it not hip or newest thing , but damn it smell good !	1
tweezerman tweezers far best tweezers i've ever purchased . they stay sharp incredibly long time making tweezing precise , quick virtually painless . when they go dull , all you send them free sharpening week or so , they arrive back good new . you can't beat !	1
tweezerman really best tweezers market say , cutest . different colors choose , fact they're reliable strong only adds them . tweezers gone dull you need them sharpened ? you don't need go store anymore buy new ones . tweezerman sharpens them free charge sh so long you send envelope . my final point : i don't see point buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair it lasts you rest your life	1
i using it ... uhh .. fifteen years ?! it best blend sweetness , spice , musk character i ever smelled . there so many perfumes , especially last decade , launched , they all smell so similar ! they so little character , if they , then they either too weird , or too something . or they give me headache . this one unique . guaranteed .	1
gives you natural , sensuous pout opposed thick layer color ( which some lipsticks require ) only make your face look sharp . not good ( smart ) sharp , but opposite sweet feminine sort sharp . tastes smells nice too :)	1
i dark circles since i young . i got older ( im 38 now ) it seemed get darker . i am makeup artist profession , so believe me when i say i tried all kinds concealers . some went smooth but coverage didnot last mid-day there those dark circles again . i literally carry concealer me because i reapply atleast 3 times day . heavier concealers worked when i put them but after awhile it would cake under my eyes , dry out make my lines more visible really made me look older ! i hesitant hylexin , like everyone , because price . i started using it but didnt see any results after few days . i guess it didnt help i constantly looking mirror . i started get disappointed but kept using it . i swear 3rd-4th week i could actually see difference ! my circles way lighter less noticeable ! i dont " bags " or puffiness , just dark circles i olive skin . i continue use it , it seems getter better better . it might not take it away completely , but it sure faded enough i now use concealer ( or just fuller coverage foundation ! ) not worry it fading or caking . i feel bad some people may not gotten results they hoped , but what you loose ! yeah $95 alot , but its cheaper not invasive surgery . it same 50/50 chance cosmetic procedures . everyones skin different reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product . also , you need follow instructions exactly ! i applied twice day didnot skip any application . i tried very hard stay out sun used my same skincare routine . i post review few weeks see if circles improved anymore . i hope this review helped	1
i bought this last month purple . looks awesome it doesn't hurt when you put it . best all it stays if you set it , it stay all day .	1
slightly floral , musky clean same time . great fragrance summer . unfortunately , it doesn't last very long this price its definately rip-off .	1
i bought this stuff after reading all great reviews . my hair 4b very thick . i hadn't perm almost year half . i put it myself followed directions exactly . past , i've really bad problems relaxers burning my scalp point i've scabs all over my head . that reason why i tried this product . it burn , but not nearly bad other relaxers my stylist used . it extremely manageable not very uncomfortable . i only left product my hair 25 minutes it recommends . it took something like 12 shampoos stuff neutralize . my hair turned out curly instead straight . guess i didn't " smooth " well enough . i would def recommend stylist put it you so you get great results . my hair looks really great flat ironed , but true test come after i've perm few weeks . my hair typically breaks off really bad right around time i need retouch . i am hoping doesn't happen w/this product . really let me know if it worth 60 bucks	1
i am african-american female long , thick hair . i relax highlight my hair , so imagine hell i when i heard you should not chemically treat your hair when you pregnant . i tried go , however after 8 weeks i dire need something . i searched web safe product found this relaxer . after rinsing it out using phyto shampoo conditioner i horrified fact my hair felt like straw . i rewashed it keracare shampoo conditioner it felt normal again . phyto relaxer same thing cheap drugstore relaxer , however it pleasant scent doesn't burn your scalp . after doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself i started notice breakage . but i assumed it pregnant . i stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started weigh me down entirely too much . i called phyto they gave me listing salons use relaxer clients . salon i went explained me i didn't understand placement when it comes relaxer . i pretty much overlapping product onto previously relaxed hair . instructions say not it , but it really hard control . i continued going salon relaxers my hair grew back . now year later , i continue use salon product . i am breastfeeding my son , so i stay away chemicals still . i suggest this relaxer all my pregnant friends don't want walk around crazy hair . i mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough	1
i highly reccomend this kit . i am esthetician lots trouble hormonal breakouts my chin , jawline neck . i using system benzoyl peroxide just too drying , even though i oily skin type . this kit great . all products full size ( except samples peels ) . products very concentrated , so i expect this kit last around 3 months . i noticed immediate difference my skin - brighter , firmer , healthier glow . i've now using it two weeks . i've few hormonal breakouts ( right before my period ) but they very small clear up much faster . it really getting rid red scarring left over previous breakouts my fine lines around my eyes certainly decreasing too . sample peels kit awesome . you get 2 peels out each sample set - so total 6 treatments . i reccomend using peels 2x week get you started - it really kicks up results	1
this product i use after i wash my face , i leave instructed five minutes , then i rinse then apply my night gel ( any product cream ) , however , i using this past three weeks , i already told friends my face looks great , what i doing different .. so this i give this product thumbs up !!	1
i've never review online product-but i can't rave enough khoret amen hair oil . i've using healthy hair butter my relaxed hair it fabulous ! it great moisturizing your scalp ends ( just use little dab though-it oil so don't over it ! ) . plus , my hubby really , really likes scent	1
little pricey , but well worth it . gives me charge morning really wakes me up ! makes you feel cool tingly all over i find i just want keep scrubbing !!! great product summer , b/c cool feeling you get even lasts while after you get out shower . also , it seems concentrated so you don't need lot it . would liked it even more if it little more moisturizing . if not , price , i would given it " perfect 5 " score	1
i give this product 4.5 stars . i long wavy/straight hair . it gets really frizzy humid weather i used use john frieda serum , worked well me . bottle just really small i would run out fast because my long hair . i decided buy this product . it thinner consistency than john frieda serum but it works just well . it make my hair soft it tames flyaways , but i would not use this product alone my hair . i usually put little this before i blowdry , little afterwards then i put bed head after party my hair before i straight iron my hair . both bed head biosilk really sink into my hair gets absorbed never looks greasy . after i , my hair super soft . i like bottle good size considering you only need like dime sized amount but i think it little pricey . but considering how long it last , i think it worth it . i would never use this my skin ( it says you use this your skin ) just because i would feel like i am putting oil or something my skin . it also smells little like hair spray , but it not overpowering . once you put it your hair , you cannot smell it . all all , great product .	1
i getting irritated skin / razor bumps / ingrown hairs ( whole nine yards ) ever since i started shaving . i've tried different cartridges , different methods shaving , even cutthroat razor ( give up right away -- much too much maintenance ) . however , purchase this merkur hd safety razor , i've finally found product i stick . people say it takes some getting used , but i found it not slightest bit more difficult than shaving cartridge razor . i get closest shaves ever it , practically no irritation . other pluses include blades last nearly week only cost 50 cents piece !! cartridges costing up three dollars , it time go old school ( especially since i'm poor college student ) . i can't compare this model other safety razors , but i say it great intro safety razor . good weight , simple use . i would definitely recommend this razor anyone fed up cost cartridges , looking simple , effective solution	1
this ideal razor start shaving if learning use double edge safety razor . there no adjustments cause confusion , non-slip grip indentations , well balanced , quality , well priced . one always upgrade merkur futur , vision , or progress models if one wants adjustable razor . this my favorite one futur 2nd . happy shaving	1
although expensive , this product produces results while other cheaper ones i've tried simply not . every now then i get few zits which don't bother me really . what bothers me dark spot lasts months after pimple gone . oxygen peel drastically reduces blotchiness hyperpigmentation . soon i rinse stuff off my face i'm always amazed look mirror see results . this stuff help keep your pores clean also . i would recommend using this product every couple weeks definately before big event ( pictures etc ) . basically you put gel over your face then add hydrogen peroxide cream , whole thing foams up , you wait 1-3 minutes ( intense tingling experienced times ) then rinse . some people say 1/2 amount recommended so product last longer but i didn't really find it worth it .	1
i like pure fiji coconut spa line . all pure fiji spa products great	1

i really like minty scent this soap . i think it best guy because it not very " girly . " soap itself looks great decorative guest bathroom soap . despite what others say it says right soaps label " remove black wax before use " i no problem all removing it . it 90 degrees ( ) out day i got soap so it kinda soft . after it hardned up bit black wax came right off no problem . i only give it four stars though because black wax thing kinda goofy . much i get point " demon dark " wax goes right trash when you get it . i would rather just buy soap out wax	1
reviewer my mid-forties , i gone through many brands moisturizer last few years looking something worked well my " normal " but sometimes stressed skin . after spending small fortune skincare products , i finally found product i count . hope jar leaves my skin clean yet moisturized feeling , perfect base foundation , it not greasy or oily . , added bonus , price seems reasonable something lasts so long . it necessary use good eye cream well , this product not meant eye area , slightly irritating . overall , i seen marked improvement my skin last 3 months since using this product	1
these glosses so beautiful . they coat most lucious way plus they don't leave you feeling like you tar your lips . thing colors don't look artificial . so many times gloss make you look like clown if you pick wrong color . however this just looks awesome . it stays you while too . only thumbs down taste factor . i expect glosses flavorful these aren't . but all grandeur product , i can't give it less than 5 stars . note buyers : colors here aren't actual colors . like sun bronze lot lighter glistens . miracle also pale shade sparkling pink . bright side every color looks good everyone so buy buy buy ! little pricy but worth it compared how long it lasts compared all other duds out there .	1
my daughter i love this product . we both love scent way it lathers i love way it feels my skin . i use it again again	1
smells fantsatic . exactly like cinnamon buns fresh out oven . also lathers well produces wonderful bubble bath . this one my all time favorites	1

i've used many other facial lotions before but none compare this one . such high quality product	1
this product works wonders over winter months . i didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after i stopped using it few days during winter . my experience , this product doesn't leave oily film your face or make you shine hours under lights . unlike other products , i don't feel like teenager going thru acne again . price quality worth it amount you need apply makes cost per application comparable other products	1
i love this stuff ! too bad it so pricey ( my pocketbook , anyways ) . i long , fine hair tangles so easily . this stuff works magic it . changes texture it soft . you dont need use much it -- dimes worth , so even if it expensive , you know its gonna last you long time . def worth it	1
i love this stuff ! pink high cheek bone really lifts your whole face darker line beneath , gave my face fantastic elegant look . definite red carpet feel , although i wear it everyday . o-o ne quite work out why i look so good , i'm sure everyone thinks i've botox ....	1
i honestly thought i going give this one lower star rating . upon receiving this item mail , i dove right . one drawback immediately hit me smell . it basically smells like mint toothpaste . i knew it going minty , just not quite so minty . so i smoothed some rubbed it up my ankles . sensation very cool i surprised how oily slippery my feet . i'm used most feet creams sinking kind dissapearing . so , my initial thought pleasant , but kind wierd . now i say though , soother moisterizer it works great . my feet very soft it works rough parts me feet very well . i'm excited try this exfoliater some sort . i took away one start toothpaste smell , but really this awesome product . summer i'll probably keep this stuff fridge . i imagine it would feel great when really really cold after long day work	1
my husband i take pot then when we go holiday , after long day walking around , we come home sore feet massage each other fair trade until we feel we stand up again . it brilliant stuff , probably only way we've made it back out hotel dinner some nights	1

so i read all reviews here before purchasing it decided i'd give it go due all good feedback ... i'm so glad i ! i've regular lancome mascara user awhile- started definicils , went l'extreme , but this what i'm sticking . my lashes look loooong ... that saying lot because i some pretty puny lashes . not only it lengthen , but it seperates thickens . i also bought cils booster ( i think that what it called - it lancome mascara primer ) my lashes just pop . great product	1
i oily asian skin i tried other lush facial cleansers ( fresh farmacy , angels bare skin , aquamarina ) this one greatly improved quality my facial skin . i use it once day after coming work before going bed . it just taken care my skin . i've late nights , stressful times , lack sleep , sometimes i haven't able wash my face all . top it off , i'm smoker . since using this product , i've gone through those i've only gotten 3 pimples . when happens me , my face usually peppered blackheads pimples . herbalism really taken care my facial skin . this stuff exquisite keeper	1

i love this day cream . it smells great hydrates beautifully without looking greasy . only downfall it doesn't spf , so you apply additional sunscreen over it . its treatment qualities , i think it made my skin somewhat more radiant smoother , it didn't make me break out . it great product price	1
this stuff costly but little it goes long way . texture this perfect . it creamy but not overly moist . it sets nicely natural dewy finish medium coverage . it never looks cakey or overly like other medium formulations . i use dallop size quarter almost week . rate i think bottle should last very long time . its also only brand perfectly matches my very fair skin ( course how it matches you depends entirely you ! )	1
this foundation worth every penny . it make your face feel firmer look younger first use . don't ask me how it works , i don't know , but tiny lines around my eyes disappeared . also , it holds up against heat , sweat , tears . it doesn't rub off your clothes , either . only way i'll ever leave this foundation if dior themselves come up new improved formula , which i can't see happening . try it counter , walk around look yourself mirror . you'll say , " wow , amazing ! " too	1
i love patchouli . unfortunately , it very hard find pure form . often it mixed other perfume scents . body shop offers wonderful products this perfume oil no exception . i only hope they continue offering this scent . try it , you won't disappointed	1

i discovered caswell-massey line accident ; bought brushless burma shave internet provider . when i ran out i searched " amazon " first discovered this product . any rate , i believe scent accurate . addition , preshave oil followed their sandlewood shaving cream gives one close shave i ever experienced . used suffer 5:00 " shadow " , sales this unsightly ; after using c.m. product thing pas t.t his excellent product expensive . however , hot , wet lather shave this reviewer makes this mundane chore pleasurable . badger hair shaving brush nice addition or it makes great gift . british concern , truefitt hill also interest shaving personal care customers	1
this soap great ! it smells like ocean , really ! seaweed sea salt gently exfoliate your skin , pine , lime , lavendar give it really fresh scent leave you feeling clean rejuvenated after washing it . i'm going buy big old chunk this stuff next time i go lush , then cut it myself into chunk soap that mostly seawee/sea salt , use scrubbing shower , that mostly glycerine , just washing my hands kitchen/bathroom sinks . smell great , so i can't limit myself only using it once day shower , right ? right ! this stuff lathers up better than most other lush soaps i've tried . scent perfect women or men - very unisex , which nice . i really don't like most flowery , female scents . even my husband used this stuff	1
i tried this product well others mustela i think they fenomenal . i gained 60 pounds my first pregnancy not get strechmarks . you must very disciplined put it everyday . although this cream bit pricey , it wonders hydrating your skin so why not pamper your body !!!	1

i love consistency this lip balm . it light , not sticky . smell this balm reminds me lemon bars , i love i t.t he reason 4/5 stars two things . sometimes smell little overwhelming . this entirely personal preference , only something happens some time . other reason balm tends not last very long me , i find little annoying . i usually just reapply , but means i end up using this up faster than lot glosses i used . i definitely am going buy this again , but knowing full well i'm just going buying it again sooner than i'd like	1

my daughter very sensitive skin these great . they clean her face hands baths , don't irritate her skin all . i really like scent too . if you don't like way other mustela products smell you won't like these , but if you then you'll love them . my only complaint , reason they didn't get 5 stars , packaging . package tends not stay closed after few days . so if you aren't using wipes regularly they dry out	1

never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1

i admit , i am sucker hair products . i very thick hair , times , little wild . i used fekkai products before , their okay . certainly not worth over inflated price tag . but i read reviews this product thought it might perfect solution my hair during winter months . wrong answer ! this product very thick , too thick me spread through my hair without putting some work into it . conditioners hair masks should well , conditioning . i left this hair mask required 20 minutes , it nothing . fact , i go back through my hair my $6.00 pantene conditioner just make my hair manageable . i also wonder what purpose putting pieces nut shells into product supposed condition hair ? all those pieces going rough up your hair cuticle . ladies , spend your money book reviews hair products ! i i've realized all hair products essentially same . only name perfumes change . read paula begoun book hair products	-1

i agree previous reviewer when i say possibly this " one ladies " . but only good way ! i first encountered this scent walking past fragrance counter mall many years ago . time , it seemed all fragrances men heavy musks , orientals , spices , etc . this ... er ... fruity . ( i see you cringing ! ) it lemony . like puff lemon cake . breeze over lemon field tuscany . ( there fields lemons tuscany ? i don't know , but it mental pic , go it ! ) spritz cologne following bit aftershave balm sure recipe get yourself sniffed cuddled . it doesn't bash you over head macho tones- it lures tingling tartness . i yet meet woman who dislikes scent . yes , i steal it my husband sometimes ! him ( light eyed blond ) it stays true bottle scent , but me ( brunette oily skin ) it morphs something vanilla notes lemon . i think it great " safe " gift people who aren't sure what cologne buy new male friend . i gave it four stars , because cologne need reapplied frequently maintain viable scent . fragrance lasts approximately four hours . but if you can't get noticed your lemony deliciousness four hours , you more problems than cologne fix .

" look , then you'll like this mascara . i'm giving it four stars instead five simply because how long it lasts but if you use it once it while , then it last you while	1

ok , if you weren't already aware , blotting papers merely same material you use separate your bum public toilet . however , i am not inclined stuff few seat covers my purse . sephora put their blotting papers mini roller attractive light blue container . this better than other packaging options , where too small papers offered kleenix-box style . sephora rolling sheet option allows you take much you need , offers efficient cutting edge easy tearing . now that what i'm talking	1

i love this foundation . i warm sand moisture rich foundation . it incredibly smooth , long wearing color makes my skin look bright radiant . bobbi brown makes very natural foundation colors there range colors all different skin tones . when i'm shopping it seems most lines cater lighter medium skin tones , but bobbi brown really come through flattering options all skin tones . only draw back this foundation not provide adequate spf protection , even though it says spf 15 . therefore , you still need wear sunscreen underneath least spf 15 . i use this foundation every day i wear sunscreen paula choice ( which i love ) . i think color options available , long lasting color smooth texture make this foundation worth price .	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1
these great candles make great gifts because they packed so nice . candles burn evenly nice slowly . scents great ! natural smelling strong enough but not overwhelming any way . i burn one these my first level scent whole floor unlike most other candles where i need burn multiple candles get same level scent ... so yes , they more expensive than candles you get but when i burn this one , its only one i need burn time ... cheaper candles i dont really end up savings because i am burning several once .	1
