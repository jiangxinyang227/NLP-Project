i saw jonathan qvc really impressed claim moisturizing conditioner great dry/damaged hair . he also said his products don't strip color out hair like some brands market . i color highlight my hair wanted something would protect it . what disapointment . conditioner bottle horrible dispensing even small amount conditioner . i remove lid . then , it like paste ... doesn't seem go through hair .. even after 3 minutes . when i tried comb my hair out , it like birds nest . i put spray leave conditioner , line , my hair just comb through it . i ordered it qvc ... it going back	-1
scale 1 5 , packaging gets negative 1 . you can't sqeeze conditioner out bottle , ended up removing top . value product , jonathan gets 1 . quality product 3 . conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter . need use more than average . conditioner average detangling after using it four times it condition your hair , but no better than other quality brands . i like it seems cut down drying time , but bed head similar product that out while . option i would rather choose bed head quality price	-1

watching show i thought jonathan really cared hair its no doubt he still but his shampoo leaves alot desired . example , even hot , very humid atmosphere houston , tx it left my hair feeling dry unhealthy , even after using his conditioner ( alot it ) . my hair looks awful after using it . bottle claims it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it use three different types peg , petroleum based thicker found most bath products erode wooden tables just minutes . this just harmful mea , especially people sensitive scalps hair . it claims not strip your hair but products supposed cleanse much less apparent product than peg products . since peg thickener , you're also getting diluted , toxic , solution . even though head shoulders uses mea i find even works better than this . my hair doesn't feel like it any more its essential oils i've switched back other hair products iv'e using . it not worth your 20 dollars , its barely worth 5 dollars . my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration . don't buy it !	-1

i'm sure this hair dryer exceptional quality - perhaps worth price some . but i'd careful buying something uses fake science babble try convince you its effectiveness . " most ionic infrared " gibberish . tourmaline , gemstone , electrical properties ( when squeezed or heated , it develops charge across crystal ) , but nothing hair drying , or ionizing air , or anything else . i'd recommend buying less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead falling pseudoscientific scam	-1

actually , i would give product 5 stars , packaging minus-2 . citylips really work , plumping hydrating ; it required repeated applications . but packaging results 10-12% ( expensive ) material completely unavailable ! worse , if you try wiggle ( too-short ) applicator order get last 10% , container breaks neck ( actually , one came already cracked my case ! ) . true , they offer some colors 2/3 price , but most effective apply clear , go outside lipline-and clear almost never gone sale !	-1

my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
i purchased entire 3-step clinique system including : clinique facial soap dishclinique clarifying lotion 2clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotionabout same time i started using clinique 3-step system , i began wearing foundation first time . i found my skin started breaking out began dry some spots . i stopped using foundation after 3 months because i thought issue . however , my skin problems not improve i even moved down level clinique system one more sensitive skin . however , after 7 months daily use , my skin not improving i found review clinique 3-step system paula begoun . her research indicates all clinique facial soaps 3-step system too irritating all skin types . her research also stated all clarifying lotions ( 1-4 ) contain alcohol clarifying lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating all skin types . i never thought my skin care products cause my flaky skin break outs . apparently , products dried out my skin making it flaky some areas response , my skin started producing more oil compensate dryness-which made me break out other areas . i switched paula choice facial products i occasionally use cetaphil . after i made switch , my skin slowly began recovering . unfortunately , now i some acne scars my cheeks result using clinique 3-step system . it makes me sad because before , my skin healthy most part clear . i want fair clinique . they some great products --- i use their city block sheer spf 15 , advanced stop signs eye spf 15 i wear clinique happy perfume which smells amazing . i hope this review proves helpful other women so you don't go through what i went through ! clinique some great products their line , but they need reformulate their 3-step skin care system .	-1
i love smell this perfume . however , it doesn't stay . i wearing perfume 18 years now used several different kinds without problem . i sold sjp this perfume when she appeared oprah . loved it when i went counter mall check it out . i using it 2 months now it just doesn't last . hour after i put it i ( or my husband ) can't smell it anymore . trust me , i learned apply it liberally it still doesn't stay . totally disappointed	-1
i'm huge fan majority philosophy line , adoring amazing grace scent ! i thought this scrub would perfect spring into summer period because light floral scent . boy i wrong !! if you love amazing grace , this smells nothing like it . it smells like plastic flowers .. not appealing all . even my fiance made comment bathroom smelled like melting plastic . if you want fantastic exfoliator , try gingerbread man or margarita scrub .. those devine ! i think i'll stick my amazing grace body lotion now	-1
this one cutest shower caps i've owned , but it didn't keep my hair dry -- cap kept sliding up my head . sephora shower cap also same thing , but , least , it only cost $5 . so far , i've found best shower caps complimentary ones i receive when i occasionally stay hotel .	-1
i bought this stuff shopping channel , thought it wasn't bad , until i went get my hair colored . color didn't take ! my hair shoulder length , i only used ojon bottom 5 or 6 inches , because that part dry . color only took ' new growth ' , not rest my hair - hair i put ojon ! smell oil , shampoo , or conditioner didn't bother me , but hair spray disgusting . people remarked i overdosed perfume , so i wash it again get rotten smell out my hair . i definitely wouldn't recommend this anyone who colors their hair .	-1

there much better products lush . i got free sample this conditioner used it lush trichomania solid shampoo . first i really liked it , but throughout day , my hair felt like it getting oilier . i'm not sure if it trichomania or coolaulin , but i gave both away my friend who likes coconut . smell wasn't my favorite either ( i'm not coconut person ) , but if you like coconut , you love shampoo conditioner . me , i stick american cream rehab . ** update**december 21 , 2005i tried coolaulin conditioner again , my hair didn't get oily all . i'm not sure what happened first time i tried it , but it fine this time around . i'm not coconut person , so this conditioner still not my fave ( american cream !! ) , but i want add two stars make rating *~* four stars *~* because conditioner made my hair really soft	-1
i quickly realized while shower i don't want smell like margarita all day . it lather well i don't find smell overpowering but it not special . warning those us chemically treat our hair , this product shampoo very drying strips color out hair .	-1
any manufacturer doesn't fully label their product should not trusted . i not see list ingredients here ( but most nail polishes don't bother this anyway ) . problem i see this ... this nail polish totes it safe use during pregnancy due fact it doesn't contain above ingredients , but what it contain instead ? if it wears well , doesn't peel , give good color coverage , it got contain something offending ingredient place , logically . please ask yourself this before you sigh relief add basket ! phthalates , example , class industrial plasticizers invented 1930s . they often used nail polish because they make nail polish flexible , they used other products because they help bleed chemicals fragrances help lotion better penetrate skin . they aren't required labeled products . lab animals given dibutyl phthalate higher numbers offspring birth defects , especially male reproductive system . nail polish may not contain phthalates ( brag it ) , but may contain related plasticizer essentially just harmful . this contain phthalic anhydride , toxic chemical hardener ? how fdc color , such yellow 5 ? it petroleum-based color also questionable when it comes safety . basically put , no nail polish safe during pregnancy . top , while your it you should review every lotion , foundation product , etc you use if you're concerned things like this . i think it great careful - more power you - but fully informed , not partially . companies prey our worst fears , what worse than harming our babies ? if this product so great , let see ingredients list ( all cosmetics should same , while i'm sounding off subject ! )	-1

i'm going europe thought this would save me time mornings ( maybe nerves , since i'm traveling two women no doubt towels short supply ! ) . but this thing hard use , instructions poorly drawn , apparently i head giant - button button latch ( which isn't easy find isn't identified directions ) don't stay together due my ginormous noggin . reason i chose this specific product try because it pink would clearly different regular hotel towels because cute tube case - i thought it would pack easily . material itself seems work ( she says it slides , yet again , down her forehead cover her eyes ) . after twenty minutes wrestling this cuddly little critter , i concede . similar items may work , just not this one	-1
huge fan pink sugar avid chocolate fanatic , i ecstatic try out chocolovers . since they don't sell chocolovers anywhere near where i live i decided order it sephora.com us . first all i thought price fairly reasonable 1.7 oz bottle ( very nice bottle package , if i might add ) , it cost me around $50 cdn . i so excited when my order came today i quickly opened up bottle gave it sniff . ahhh sickeningly sweet smell disappointment . i don't know what i expecting , maybe something more like milk chocolate , but what i got strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into very strong sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries chocolate hint musk . this may sound good , but much fan sweet candy/foody smells i am , i found this one too overpowering it seriously made me sick . right now all i smell sickly sweetness smell flat seven up . plus side it stopped completely my cravings sweets . i think if i trying diet i would wear this scent everyday . i think i keep it hopes it grow me because i really love look bottle box it came . i am also going try layer it cocoa body lotion hopes it tame down some sweetness . bottom line try before you buy	-1

dermablend leg body cover reminds me alot mud . you know how you get mud your shoes it dark first but then dries look alot lighter flakes off ? that very accurate comparison this product . it sets very chalky , dry , finish which appears flaky pasty , corpse like gray tinge it . it creepy looking ! even all colors available it still looks unnatural ashy when dry . only way i able use it cover my tattoo product then disguise hideously fake makeup under pair thick , shimmery dance tights !! you couldn't pull it off just makeup your bare skin though . it would great if you want dress up like mummy or decaying corpse halloween though	-1

after reading great reviews votivo candles i decided spend rediculous sum $24 moroccan spice candle . when i received candle i smelled sweet spice coming it even before i opened packaging . readying myself rocket rich fragrance immersing my room exotic spice i hopefully lit candle . after hour candle lit i came into my room it scented only 3 feet around candle . dissapointed , perhaps prove there absolutely no way i didn't get jacked this purchase i lit it again-this time 3 hours . there still no smell . compare this $6 ' tea ' candles i bought gold canyon candle co . which when i lit 6 them richly scented not only my room ( which 13 ' 13 ' ) but hallway , well my mothers room next door ( 16 ' 16')!if your thinking maybe $22+ dollars would worth it exotic fragrances-think again there nothing special scent you couldn't get grocery store . jipped-you bet	-1
this product no better than any regular washcloth and/or headband hold your hair back . save your money	-1
this product didn't work me , described . first all , it smell nice , which different usual fumes nail polishes give off ! smells lemony ! its also easy use - you brush it over nails surrounding area , let it set awhile until it gets dull then gently buff it off tissue . all fine dandy , but it didn't leave my nails all dry , nor it leave them shiny . fact , they less shiny than shiny topcoats i use . i also worse case bedsheet wrinkles embedded my manicure night after using this product - could unrelated , but i've never seen so many creases smudges my nails when i woke up i let them dry few hours after painting them ! i wouldn't recommend this product .	-1

this product such waste . little granules made mess when used styling agent blow-drying hair . i not repurchase it .	-1
falling love one my favorite scents ever . it basically my go-to fragrance everyday . if you're fan this scent you already know it really pretty but very light . that why i exited solid touch-ups go . let me tell you , subtle understatement this product . when i opened seal held it under my nose i could hardly smell it . when i applied it ( generously ) my wrist scent barely detectable . i rubbed my wrists together gently warm perfume it didn't help all . i expected this fairly concentrated so little dabs would suffice . very disappointing .	-1
i looking forward lovely lavender scent when i got this soap , but sadly , that not what happened . smell very strong herbal ; like kind you would add italian pasta dish . not very appealing ! there some complexity scent , but it so overshadowed herb smell really come through . plus side , color beautiful ( rich , dark purple ) lather equally lovely look . if you like true herbal scents , then you should give this try . it just wasn't me .	-1
" happy " really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins . it like cheap colognes .	-1

i am black american combination hair ... nappy , wavy straight . i've using drug store relaxers over 30 years ( cr�me nature , tcb , dark lovely , revlon realistic ) whatever " sale " satisfying results . these products leave my hair evenly straight shiny but hard stiff immediately after process . i usually wash my hair after few days ( i like give it rest after relaxing ) use good conditioner soften detangle . there i am able go 12 weeks before retouch . general my hair healthy responds well straightners . my biggest expense conditioning products maintain my hair . i'll try anything spend any amount if it works well my hair . i great success frederic fekkai products love phytodefrisant botanical hair relaxing balm ... this stuff amazing if you like wash go ( air dry ) it works wonders blow drying/flat ironing too . ( bumble bumble styling spray amazing product great flat ironing results . ) i forked out $60 try phtyo2 after reading all rave reviews . i am satisfied outcome but not blown away . yes , phyto2 not smell bad , it not burn my scalp it straighten my hair but no better than dark lovely or tcb , my hair still hard stiff afterward . it several weeks my hair doing great , but again no different when i use dark lovely . i guess i am lucky my hair responds well any type relaxer so i doubt i'll spending $60 phyto2 ... i'd rather buy two tubes phytodefrisant balm continue my $7.99 drug store brands . i hope this helps someone similar hair mine . if you well drug store brands , phyto results not different ... spend money their other products nourish condition your hair	-1

i generally love lush soaps , but not recommend this one . demon dark great name , but it doesn't smell very good ( sort faint , slightly minty scent ) . it also black wax coating rather difficult peel or scrape off , but must removed soap work properly . i would try red rooster or karma soap instead	-1
i thought product arrived timely manner . instructions clear , but it hard hold stencils put your eyebrow same time . not bad product price	-1

i just got this item ( ebay , it cheaper)and feel it worthy praise . i thick , straight hair , bought this product wave my hair . i haven't figured out how it curls , but wave it incredibly easy ! grab your hair root twist outward it waves nice fast w/o burning your hair like curling iron would . also w/ curling iron , it difficult wave top close roots . it heats fast ! comes w/ nice pouch so you put it away before it cools .	1
high beam provides glow or sheen , where my cheeks seem dull . it not look greasy ... i would say it makes skin look healthy vibrant	1
i am big fan this product . my hair very strong . it needs product which keep it tamed . however , most products level strength also come high sheen or gloss which , my opinion , bad look today fashions . matte look more flexible . american crew fiber gives me pliability matte look very strong hold . it also smells nice .... not strong not too girly	1
this stuff great . i used buy new gels , pommades , pastes , etc . every month because i could never find one worked exactly how i wanted it . but i first tried this year ago it all i've used since . it lasts long time , so don't afraid price . one container lasts me 6 months , so you only buy it twice year . i'll ordering my third order it soon	1

( very good one ! )	1
i don't know what complaints this product . it seems people trying use it extreme hold hairstyles . this not purpose this product . i use it my short haircut make ends stay spiky styled out , it works wonderfully . no matter how much you move your head , it stays place , but somehow moves enough keep you stiff look . , when you brush your hair out end day , it feels like you never put it . hair stays soft feels clean . reason why this gel thinner it isn't sticky or goopey your hair other gels . it spreads out easier	1
i never wanted waste my money manicure , because my polish would chipping/peeling next day . my pedicurist bet me she could keep polish my manicure using this stuff , low behold ... it worked ! it kept polish week even through housecleaning trip vegas	1
still life bath bomb contains pretty sunflower petals make this summery bath experience . truthful , after putting this bath i walked away came back into room , wondering who eating fruit loops ! scent this " fun take bath before breakfast " experience . fresh scent lemon sweet wild orange mingles bergamot gardenia extract . result this bath refreshing - i face day feeling . if you want enhance experience , try happy hippy shower gel grapefruit . i love juicy shampoo veganese conditioner also complete citrus experience . if you think petals this bath bombs fun ( ones my bath slipped right down drain ) , wait until you try big blue experience seaweed . it take adventurous spirit try some these items , but official lush addict , i tend dive into experiences abandon . you may also love golden slumbers ( lavender neroli ) , sex bomb ( jasmine , ylang ylang , clary sage ) , romance stone ( wild orange , mandarin tangarine ) . onward try tisty toasty which i hear bit love spell style bath rose petals . ~ rebecca review	1

i love idea this all natural mascara + organic ingredients but nothing artifical or chemicals !! this tipe mascara which lengthens lashes not volumises it ( i think dr. hauschka doesn't make kind ) . when it time wash it off it comes off very easy ( spares your lashes ) . unfortunately i couldn't change my 4 star recommendation 2 ... this follow up my previous review . when i'd using this mascara 2 weeks i noticed it started flake except some reason flakes ended up my eyes , not my cheek or under my eyes . first i didn't know it mascara .. i thought something went into my eyes but every single time i applied , it happened . not straight away .. but 2-3 hours later .. this very frustrating ... i tried put less this product my lashes but then i looked like i nothing . this point i still some flaking , not bad before , but it still enough hurt my eyes .. so i just stopped using this product all together . only reason why i'd give 2 stars this product instead 1 because it natural organic ... i appriciate fact . but that it . i really wanted like this product so i am very disappointed , it wasn't cheap either . dr. hauschka need improve quality this product	-1
this only blemish treatment i ever tried get rid anything . ive using it 8 years it never let me down . you use it spot treatment or if you area clogged pores your nose you put little every night help clear those up . it isnt meant go places your face where you no acne or blemishes though . it strong cause little peeling if you put it your entire face . it little pricey , but size this container probably last you close year	1
this my first badger brush , i don't know how competent reviewer i , but i am really happy it . it large enough hold lot foam ( sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much ) . it fairly heavy robust , which i also like . i've using it 6 months now , feeling it going last years . make sure hang it dry wash it thoroughly after each use . anybody who new wonderful world shaving brush , i highly recommend this page intro : [ ... ]	1
i can't even begin explain how much i love this product . although teen age acne long gone me , like most women certain time month , i get little flair up here there . this product great . totally takes red out i say speeds healing process well . i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it there few times day esp when i saw begingings one . ones i caught early never really turned into full blown acne . yes it pricey but i think it worth every penny .	1

i know it sounds cliche , but i literally tried every acne product both over counter prescription . such products include ( but not limited ) proactiv , exposed skin care , differin , accutane , neutrogena products , clean clear , etc . i never results like this . i previously tried murad acne complex found it little too harsh my red , irritated , sensitive skin . i currently switched sensitive line murad acne complex which consists this cleanser , moisturizing acne treatment gel cellular replenishing serum . i found my cistic acne gone , blotchiness reduced number whiteheads drastically reduced . my skin never looked so smooth all my pre-teen young adult life i only using this particular line 4 days ! addition sensitive acne complex , i would also recommend getting clarifying toner . remember , little goes long way these products !	1

this excellent product but i problem disguising white look it leaves my face . first i thought it because i used too much , but even when i use only tiny amount it still white . it certainly suit persons pale complexions . wish there tint it	-1
i absolutely fell love this fragrance . it smells like day county fair , absolutely lovely . you layer it though make it last .. wash shower gel , put body lotion first thing when you get out shower or bath , ( perfumes " stick " better way , while you're " moist " ) , then spray . if you wash your hair , spray while your blow-drying it out . carry spray your purse , you need " touch up " during day	1

i used many , many products cheapest drugstore ones high end department store stuff kinerase cream truly one best overall skin improvement . i am big fan minimal redness irritation this cream delivers spades . leaves my skin beautifully soft , super smooth all without added perfume ( who going smell your face ? ) additives . i also used lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate , but i much prefer this cream which adds more moisture doesn't contain any retinoids which cause irritation . isn't whole premise purpose kinerase anyway ? great stuff	1
if you dry skin your hands these gloves very nice . i place mine microwave 15 seconds while i apply moisturizer my hands . slide gloves onto your hands soon microwave finished . 15 minutes you quick , but effective moisturizing treatment . if your hands really dry you could same thing but leave them overnight . i found overnight option little warm my hands . but , it might work fine you . these socks 94% cotton 6% spandex . they machine washed tumbled dried . i not found it necessary launder them each time i use them . i use light moisturizer ( cetaphil ) , so you might different experience if you use heavier product moisturize . i would highly recommend this product .	1

anyone who gave this lotion low rating simply so because they don't realize achieving great curly hair process . there no one product all work . i thick , frizzy , damaged , curly hair . i use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum , then after letting air dry few minutes finish gel or mousse hold . curl enhancing lotion really really improves look my curls - uneven ringlets loose waves , almost universal loose big curl - it beautiful ! only downside tiny bottle such high price . it should least 8oz	-1

this perfect winter cream me , would probably work anyone else who very dry skin ( e.g. , you rub eucerin night ) . it very similar regular cream appearance ( pink ) smell ( not offensive ) , but it much heavier . i started using this during winter when i discovered regular cream wasn't heavy enough it works just well . it spreads pretty easily such thick cream when i wake up my skin dewy moisturized .	1
i absolutely love smell philosophy cinnamon buns . like other reviewers said , it doesn't last long after shower but it nice way wake up morning . even my husband likes it he really picky anything scented . i only use it shower gel not shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth expense . i like other cinnamon buns products also - i use cream lip gloss	1
i mixed feelings philosophy products . one thing they really number my skin far drying certain areas my skin out . other hand , i use very congested skin nose area but i noticed huge difference congestion my skin when using when hope not enough serum . i haven't noticed any lifting but line my eyebrows softened . far reducing facial hair growth don't count it . i am only giving this 4 stars because even though it helped keep my congestion under control , it hasn't much more than i think it bit pricy just exfoliator	-1

lush makes few products lemon , but i think this one best because it coconut oil deep conditioning it little intoxicating scent vetivert . earthy fragrance may appeal your wilder side if you enjoy jungle conditioner which also contains vetivert oil . use this conditioner after daddy-o shampoo all you imagine you walking through fields lavender drinking coconut milkshake . i also recommend honey trap lip balm smitten hand cream . " all jas " also wonderful product bath . ~ rebecca review	1

much better terms coverage than new loreal makeup diane keaton touts , which more creamy but just doesn't cover well . avon mousse foundation goes almost like powder but doesn't block my pores . i highly recommend it	1
covers great ( i read splotches ) good my skin . cannot recommend it highly enough	1
i bought this because i wanted primer make up , but acne prone skin felt most other primers would make me break out , some reviews stated . initially i break out little , but i kept using it becuase rest my skin looked so great felt so smooth . after week breakouts went away ( they minor ) all i say wow . my skin looks so much better , my make up looks better , i look better without make up , etc . etc . i use it complete me powder foundation i never all my 38 years happier pair products .	1
i am highly sceptical myself when it comes skincare products . i received this gift after trying mask magnaminty ( also good ) . i blown away how this product made my skin feel . i used every product under sun am regular proactiv customer . this scrub great my oily skin left it feeling really clean soft . i am totally hooked ! you love it too ... totally worth money	1

i used philosophy products over year now am proponent their exfoliators cleansers . i enthusiastically bought present after seeing it new product nordstrom counter . bottle says it clear makeup fine lines , wrinkles , uneven texture . it used three different ways ; alone oil-free moisturizer sensitive skin ; over oil free moisturizer ( such hope jar ) create illusion airbrushed skin ; under foundation smooth finish . i after airbrushed skin , this product works great if used over moisturizer . it truly minimize pores fine lines . if you don't like wear lot makeup , it gives you very fresh natural look . unfortunately , no matter how diligent your , sometimes blemishes pop up you use foundation . present not suitable this function me . used under my foundation , my makeup felt cakey , thick , foundation not blend well into this product . it left unsightly foundation streaks difficult correct . i could not hold my mac foundation responsible , because used alone it not exhibit any these qualities . i would highly reccomend this product " clear makeup " but not foundation primer indicated back bottle . if you looking foundation primer , i would reccomend smashbox photo finish . it extremely lightweight , blends well foundation , bottle last forever because you use such small amounts .	-1
great towel gym or after swimming . very absorbant i also use one cover circuit machines when i use them	1
spearmint top note , lemon middle , clean bottom . patrick wore this ( yes , it great manly men too ) when we ran half marathon last week my nose followed him all way finish line . truly unusual pleasurable scent . it green , but not obvious chypre leafy modern sense like chanel crystalle . nope , this mint like julep . i've never biggest guerlain fan--i've left shalimar-isms my grandmother , who ravissante those old fashioned orientals ... but guerlain splendid aqua allegoria line -- which includes herba fresca equally divine pamplelune ( grapefruit chamomile burst ) , among others -- truly fresh . i get lots compliments when i wear herba fresca	1

this one my favorites . i love scent . it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries because it not supposed . it supposed smell like strawberry milkshake ( i think they good job it - so this what i expected ) . philosophy good job matching scent name . only thing i didn't expect i still need condition conditioner . i'd say it shampoo shower gel , 2-in-1 , not 3-in-1	-1

i suffered rosacia past nine years . i fairly young starting through change life , i no idea what causing my complexion problems . not understanding ( or expecting)what happening my skin , i made many many mistakes during first year or so , trying remedy symptoms countless products formulated more adult acne or aging tired skin , bad idea . if you rosacea or very sensitive skin , you know sometimes it seems all you need touch your skin wrong way you break out , let alone slathering some chemically based , perfumed , or exfoliating ( ground pits like ) product your face . this becomes especially discouraging when you also beginning see normal signs aging but sensitivities won't allow you take advantage some great treatments out there nourish your skin stay step ahead wrinkles , not mention feeling starved moisture which real key younger , healthy looking skin . after awhile i afraid try anything else , so i just stopped . i washed my face gently left it . well it only got worse i felt like dried up prune . enter philosophy hope jar dry sensitive skin . it if this product made just me . now instead people asking me " what wrong your face ? " they ask , " what type skincare you use ? " since i've using philosophy skin care line , i find i guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup , something i rarely since my twenties . since sun protection so important , philosophy offers product called , when hope not enough spf 20 daytime which comes bottle , but i found my skin responds much better hope jar-dry sensitive formula , then followed philosophy seperate sunsreen called shelter-spf 15 . this because " shelter " not contain vitamin or peptides slightly lower concentration sunscreens , contrary spf-20 moisurizer combo . you may able get combination product save few bucks , but aforementioned ingredients it not agree my sensitivities , especially vitamin . much needed exfoliation dilemma , try philosophy , micro-delivery peel pads or their " peel kit " both soothing non-abrasive . hope this helps enjoy your new skin !	1

most waterproof mascaras designed come off oil-based remover . stupid idea ; our skin oil it . after couple hours we end up " racoon " eyes .

i'm giving this product 4 stars how well this pencil blends any brow color .... i would think people who use like define brows pencil , this perfect neutral color . i subtracted one star because iprefer apply brow definers brow powder brush . i think it looks more natural .. brenda christian makes brow powder which i prefer over pencils but color this pencil far superior any powderi find . sometimes i mix two . i start pencil add bit powder . all all , it color this pencil superior all other eyebrow pencils	-1

i decided try it out found only soap i want use . fragrance great , it not overpower . i guess milling process gives soap it texture which removes need all those bath/shower accessories . 1 bar lasted over 2 months . i definitely ordering more trying other products this vendor carries	1
benefit claims this all you want wear , i am starting think this might true ... first , i say texture intriguing . it balm , but it feels much more velvety , slight shimmer gives you sheen . second , i am sucker packaging presentation . it comes little tin box , signature bathina ( very retro chic ) black powder puff pink ribbon holder . it makes you want apply product public , just excuse show off set . also , it ups feminity factor applying product little puff ( very " i adore girl ... " ) then , there scent . it floral , sexy fragrance doesn't overpower . it clean big plus it doesn't make me sneeze , like some other scents . i think little goes long way , thus , i say even though it " boutique-brand " product , it very affordable . i think warmer weather sets , you want show off little more skin , this product would enhance tan .	1

those bored same old bottles shampoo hair products their local drugstore this fun new way washing their hair no chemicals natural botanicals truly wonders enhance every single hair . this solid shampoo bar works wonderfully ; i my doubts just like everyone else , worried this would remove build up but leave hair overly squeaky clean stripped , if it would later all . my surprise this small disc turns into avalanche bubbles once i wet it rub it hands . i also wet my hair rub bar all over , working lather form my hands lather wet bar . i admit this produces more lather than liquid shampoos washes hair without leaving it feeling like it tortured , instead its slippery wonderfully light . afterwards i follow american cream conditioner ( probably best hair scented product universe ) also lush head hair feels rich buttery soft , fresh light fragrance lingers . scent itself wonderful , citrusy earthy , patchouli oil , orange oil , lavendin oil , pine oil , lemongrass oil , elemi oil , gardenia extract roman chamomile flower . i often find all oils rich botanicals nourish hair leave it feeling happy , organic natural products high interest me lately because results they deliver bouncy hair supple skin . after using drugstore even expansive brands hair products skin potions , i find my skin hair never really benefited all those preservatives unnatural products derived mineral oils god knows what else . lush burt bees , jason body shop made me change my mind seek out products good they smell , truly transform me sleepy duckling morning happy princess time my morning routine over . - kasia .	1

know you . you me . looking what seemed simple thing - scented candle actually smells up room when you light it . you've bought cheap ones grocery store sent out weak scent , well , grocery store . some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use toilet which then make you think poop which not all what you going living room . so then you hit expensive pretty versions - perhaps even candle stores cute waxy names . they not candles , my friend . they sculptures . some fancy ones come cute packaging crispy dried flowers . this when you lose your patience . i not want crispy dried flowers . i want candle pumps good scent all over room when i light i t.t his it . votivo . you walk into room room smell like candle . most universally loved scent probably red currant . i also enjoy rain . little glass it comes makes cute vase after candle . plus , they make perfect last minute hostess gifts , box very nice expensive-looking . so , votivo isn't cheapest candle world . they're still cheaper than buying bunch cheap candles stink ... weakly stink .	1
pictures posted here paul joe blotting paper compact don't it justice . compact very beautiful , large all covered pretty flower-patterned material . very feminine , very stylish , very pretty . my only complaint ? i wish it snap or something so it'd stay closed instead only folding ... price bit steep first but fortunately , they consider refills affordable price . my experience , i haven't found different brands blotting paper very different amongst themselves this no exception , it gets job adequately , only prettier package ... far blotting goes , this one blots shine like it should but get it stylish case convenience affordable refills	-1

calling this peel doesnt seem quite right . when i think word peel i imagine old gel type peels you would let dry your face then take off like mask . or i think something harsh or abrasive . while this works like peel it gentle goes far beyond what you would expect facial product . you need this product if you- your skin prone break out very congested - your skin sun damaged - your skin aging rapidly - you enjoy in-office medical peels - you big event coming up want your skin look great - you want maximize penetration your treatment products - you want baby soft skin also if you smoke ! i first tried this years ago when i smoker it made such difference texture clarity my skin . this truly amazing product completely different unique anything else market . try it you'll see . this product also lasts surprisingly long time . you only use half capsule each treatment which gives you several months usage out it	1

i just got this perfume valentine day . i love it ! yes , it sweet smelling , reviewer mentions , but it pleasant sweetness . cotton candy describe it , actually . but who says grownups don't like smelling yummy ?? there hint vanilla well overall , i think combo fantastic ! i love curious , now i love fantasy , too ! they two very different perfumes , so it easy understand why person like one not other . i say , though , fantasy lasts far longer than curious . you apply it morning still smell it when you go sleep ! which , i don't mind all ... i recommend this , course , but i recommend you sample it before you buy . just because you liked curious doesn't mean you like this one	1

so far this best thickening mascara i tried either sold drug stores or department stores . it not sticky or gloppy you won't look like tammy fay spider lashes . i however , apply two coats bring out more sparse areas my lashes , but i finally stopped my search thickening mascaras . my journey ends here	-1
this best micro peel i ever tried ! thing i noticed first when i applied " when hope not enough " " present " they went so smoothly . they absorbed equally . my mid-30 , my young skin fading , but this really brought it back . i won't say i am 19 again , but i am sure difference obvious . i am hairstylist my customers making mention how great my skin looks since i added this my bag tricks . it lot more effective i would thought , i not microdermabrasion since i started using this 2-4 times per month	1

product works well . it whole lot better than using your fingers =	1
i used tend skin around three years now razor bumps bikini line . before i started using it , i tried everything else resigned fact i'd always stuck bumps bikini line . friend mine told me tend skin swore it , so i bought small bottle . it seemed like it expensive , but first bottle lasted well over 6 months . it smell like alcohol first but smell goes away when it dries . far other reviews here , i've only stinging when i used it immediately after shaving ... i think b/c pores still open shower . me , it skin saver when i'd already given up search . i hope negative reviews here don't discourage people trying it . everyone skin reacts somewhat differently . millions bottles tend skin sold every year , i think half dozen people here who didn't like it few unhappy rarities , not average who , like me , thank goodness it around .	1
this very suttle fragrance , lasts hours . slightly floral , however very intimate scent , most people need get very close notice , which good , but also sign you need spray yourself all over . i would recommend picking this up if you want something carry around your purse spray here there . it last hours but not " all day " perfume	-1
all higher end mascaras i've tried , this one far best . your lashes look longer thicker just one coat looks like natural great lashes , not made up . creamy gel formula goes smooth , never clumps or feels sticky-and true form , your lashes curl up nicely . although not water proof mascara , it incredible staying power , cleans off easily . i love this mascara , won't look elsewhere	1
hsuan wen hua hair treatment one best hair treatments i've come across ... i'm huge hair junkie tried many things . ever since finding lush several months ago , i not even touched brand hair care . hsuan wen hua hair treatment made fresh ingredients like bananas , avocadoes fresh olive oil . you use this before you wash your hair , so apply it dry hair . i usually put my hair up pony tail only ends because that where damage . then i twist my hair up bun rubberband plastic bag over it . i try leave it long i ( overnight if i'm lucky ) , shampoo my hair condition like regular after . because this treatment not so much hair conditioner , you still need use seperate conditioner . results amazing my hair so much softer such better condition after use . since i only ends , it easy feel difference ends my hair treated rest my hair not . hsuan wen hua hair treatment m-u-s-t my hair regime . definately recommended	1
i love this shampoo . my husband bought it but i definitely use it more than he :) anyway , it smells amazing really works well my unruly hair	1
this far one best lip treatments market . pricy ... yes . but well worth every cent . few two uses my lips gone cracked whole . tastes good it smells . lemon ... brownsugar .. like body scrub same name . my only complaint : it doesn't longevity say prada lip balm ( which i use when running )	1
this great item lush . it works so well , lasts very long time worth every penny . first off scent . it dead-on fresh coconut . not fake sun tan oil/beach smell you'd expect . it makes ton creamy , thick lather only few swipes through ( soaking ) wet hair . it cleasnes really well rinses clean . me , there no residue left behind , only softness . i said , it last ages but you make sure you leave it well ventilated soap dish drain . if it left water , say goodbye it couple days , you left mushy mess half size when you left i t.t ry it least once , if it doesn't work your hair ... it also great shave	-1

l'occitane lavender harvest matte face lotion * really works * mattify oil makes nice makeup primer . i don't oily skin , but tried some samples over night serum i using avocado oil mattify it , so my face wouldn't greasy my pillow . it left my skin feeling satiny smooth . avocado one heavier , thicker oils wonders my dry skin , but i hated feel it , so finding this real bonus fix problem . lavender oil also relaxing aromatherapeutic properties , natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes , mosquitoes don't like it , so if you oily skin live humid climate summer , you should try this ! note : i good luck shopping l'occitane through amazon , but called first make sure what i ordering stock their website .	-1

i brought kit which included both ultra hydrating shampoo conditioner well hair treatment qvc . first all , lets talk smell . yes there smell but it not really bad , honestly . it slight coffee smell , but since i used hair treatment pre-shampoo treatment , smell wasn't really worth complaining because it not noticable after you shampoo . second , hair treatment absolutely great hair braided styles extended periods time or just mistreated needs little tlc . it restores moisture elasticity my starving hair . i don't course or very kinky hair , but it very thick this stuff works very well my thick hair . it also moisturizes scalp , which i love . only thing i'd want change price , wish it little cheaper , but because it not , i guess i value it all more	-1
every other foundation i've tried some ashy undertone , no matter what color i tried , even when color itself right . this one exceptation . they seemed got undertone thing right . i got great coverage , same time managed it looking natural . it oil free , but not chalky : think dewy , not greasy , which i appreciate person oily skin . my skin looked like it naturally near-flawless even , but it also lookked like i wearing little no foundation . i hear it buildable though , so someone who likes cake-face makeup could it	1
ok , this first lipstick my mom let me wear/buy . 15 years ago ! it still my favorite . you can't go wrong	1
i only used clinique eye shadows so happy them . i've tried different brands always come back this one . they great colors it lasts all day without creasing or looking too " powdery " .	1
i wish i could agree pp , but i still problem feathering i tried everything . this product works very well . i wear sheerest lip glosses it stays within my lip line . dark colors , i no longer worry feathering always occurs this keeps lip color inside your lipline . this also works nice eyebrow wax	1
mac lipglass absolute best . there plenty colors choose , super-shiny , gloss thick , stays doesn't run . best colors .... nico cute lavender pink color glittery shine . oystergirl shimmery baby pink . oh baby perfect gloss any earth toned lipstick . chai looks amazing black smokey eyes . it perfect neutral earthy gloss no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine	1
clinique clarifying lotion step #2 their 3-step skin care system . ( you start their soap , then follow lotion dramatically different moisturizer ) . what i love this one , made larger pores , really effectively exfoliates resurfaces your skin without stripping it its natural oils too much . you really feel it working , pull out impurities . well worth investment ....	1
smells fresh slightly fruity but not cloying all . since i generally dislike fruity perfumes plus . nice enough but not heart stopping . i don't think i'll buy it again	-1
its scent makes me want eat apple ... delicious best word it . good daytime , evening , whenever you want smell fresh spring . you'll love it	1
i am very pleased these pencils . quality excellent , i love eyebrow brush connected cover . these pencils worth every cent	1
purchased xmas stocking stuffer ; item received faster than i expected holidays . if you know child enjoys lip gloss collects key chains this ideal	1
these eye liners creamy , soft texture results satiny matte finish . texture makes them easy apply ( no liquid drops cheeks ) either classic thin line or smudged smoky effect . two shades available - black indigo . black jet , true black , indigo merits its name it deep , deep blue looks stunning any eye color . best part color lasts all day into evening without fading or running . it used either wet or dry depending effect you want . , course , they both come mercier trim mirrored signature compact . hint : apply line just above upper lash roots make lashes look fuller thicker . amazing	1
after seeing sjp promote her new fragrance oprah , i smell it myself ! i got my chance magazine , boy i love it ! i hoped get it gift , because it seems bit pricey me . however , i didn't get it . still not sure if i want spend money it , but i love scent	1
this eyeliner works described . i would give it 5-stars except i'm not big fan liquid eyeliners use brush . it too hard control applicator , especially if you want apply under lower lashes . since this brush liquid eyeliner , it can't easily smudged smoky look . course , fact it can't smudged , once it dried , whole point this product . it cleaned up before it dries , but once it sets , it stay there until you take it off . when you want take it off , it comes off very easily , cleanly , really doesn't require anything but plain water remove . i've found very helpful when i travel . i also sensitive eyes , but this product not bothered me all , probably because it doesn't flake or transfer into my eyes . if there just some way get this product " marker " style , few more colors , i would heaven , even high price	-1
i browsing lush newsletter read dream cream used alleviate horribly painful dry skin accompanies cancer patient skin during course chemotherapy . since family member undergoing both chemotherapy radiation therapy , i thought i would buy tub see if it indeed relieve horrid eczema-like patches skin covering her body . i figured we nothing lose ; we tried everything else not found anything worked yet . eternal skeptics , i say we both pleasantly surprised how well it worked . it immediately relived burning itching often accompanies dry skin . it took couple days liberally applying lotion 2-4 times day swelling redness diminish , but it finally disappear . i think if you standard dry skin , applying it this often might make you feel bit greasy side . i found it if you particularly painful dry skin , it helps keep tub dream cream refrigerator . coolness lotion further augments relieving properties essential oils cream . i would say little this cream go quite long way . if you slather ton it once , it leave you feeling bit sticky . earlier review mentioned it leave you feeling greasy if you put it your face ; however , it should noted dream cream meant used hands body not meant used facial moisturizer . i would also say scent definitely herbal , but scent ( least my tub dream cream ) quite subtle . i not find it overwhelming . if you particularly fond strong scents characterize many lush products , then you might disappointed this cream . but , if you dry , itchy , scaly skin , i would strongly recommend this cream . it expensive , but it definitely worth it .	1
living hot steamy florida , looking something refreshing , i gone through range philosphy lemony shower gel combos : first sweet sugar ( very nice sugar smell , hint lemon ) frozen lemon custard ( didn't like it all- too much artificial vanilla smell , but first time i didn't like philosophy product ) now lemonade . i love smell , like sniffing real lemon , not fake lemon scent . very fresh clean . i am following it up lemon body souffle sweet sugar cologne cool , light summery scent . those who say philosophy products cost lot- they pay living wage their employees put more money high-quality ingredients product , not packaging advertising . not get heavy , but i'd rather really good quality product than my dollars going fancy packaging advertising campaign featuring some over-priced cokehead model . so , feeling fresh clean physically ethically	1

" i prefer bubble bars because i like bubble baths also they more economical you break them up use them more than one bath , but sometimes throwing whole bomb treat itself . really indulgent experience , try 1/3 creamy candy bubble slice blackberry bomb - it makes purple bubbles smells so yummy . but only those who like strong scented baths i think ..	1

this shaving gel terrific ! it not sensitive skin , shave it provides very close , so it might irritate those sensitive skin types . it doesn't clog your razor , little definitely goes long way ! only reason i gave it four stars out five , because it goes rather clear , so you really can't see shave lines , so when shaving my legs , i feel it , but other than , it absolutely fantastic , i highly recommend !	-1
i using lancome moisturizers many years every time i try brand i come right back lancome , especially resolution d-contraxol anti-wrinkle treatment . ( they updated/renamed this product few times over years but apparently only add some new ingredients - texture effects consistent i believe better ) . i havent found moisutrizer same feel this one- its light easy blend lets your skin breathe so you don't feel " coated " thick film . i found it makes my makeup go better more evenly since its absorbs right into skin makes it smoother . it truly makes my otherwise dull skin glow ! i can't really testify anti-wrinkle claims because i'm too young wrinkles wear spf 60 every time i leave house , but hopefully its working ! my only complaint it doesn't high spf protection , but i think adding it would totally change product make it thicker , thereby negating all its wonderful attributes . therefore , i highly recommend using it twice daily ( or once if you prefer different nighttime one ) adding high spf top prevent skin damage .	1

if i could lifetime supply these , i would take bath one every day . people keep saying you cut bubble bar half get plenty bubbles , but i felt indulgent i used entire thing . i don't think i've ever seen so many bubbles one bath ! they stayed until end . smell deliciously sweet , water so soft silky afterwards i shaved no shaving cream or anything . this may sound silly , but if someone ever made bed soft those bubbles , i'd want one . i playing them , kind patting them my hands ( which didn't pop them ) , i just could not get over how soft they . when water got cold , i just turned faucet back added more hot water . three times . i so much trouble dragging myself out tub i thought someone going come after me ! i still smell like candy several hours later . i even conditioned my hair totally different scent , my hair definitely smells like bubble bath . i'm addicted lush now ! this month really stressful , i'm getting through it taking bath every evening something lush . massage bars also wonderful	1

first time i put this , i noticed texture little thinner than regular lip venom . flavor more ... i don't know ... medicinal i guess . tingle " maxi-lip " nice , it lasts quite awhile . i put it few times day i got it slightly disappointed i didn't see or feel difference -- until i woke up next morning . there noticeable difference my upper lip cupid bow . i still prefer lip venom over 2nd sin far flavor texture , but this works	-1

this product amazing . i use it under my eyes my cheeks where i enlarged pores then wait 2 minutes apply makeup lines pores gone . it makes makeup last longer too . my daughter breaks out every once while if she something important then we put this stuff over pimple then apply makeup . it makes huge difference again , it helps coverage last longer .	1

i absolutely love this shampoo ! small amount product it takes make mass lather incredible . which nice because you won't go through bottle quickly . it great job gently cleansing my hair without making it feel like straw afterwards . now scent ... utterly addictive ! now i'm not big fan mint smells , but way this blended other scents amazing . you definitely smell mint , but it not any means overpowering . mixed mint wonderful fruit scent , literally smells " juicy " . background , very lightly touch herbal . i happen hate anything herbal , so i surprised i even liked this . smell very unique delicious ! ok , all said though - it just good job most any other lush shampoos ( including some solids ) . i also use their trichomania big they same kind lovely job rehab . price just kills me . i know real oils , juices herbs used , but unfortunately i can't afford make this item staple . still , if you don't problem price , definitely pick up bottle ( start smallest size though ! ) give it try .	-1
i am first time lush customer , but this shampoo alone me convinced try more their products . recently , i noticed my " good old " matrix shampoo left my naturally wavy hair limp dull . i read lush solid shampoo lucky magazine , thought i'd give it try . i ordered seanick through their website . box arrived today , i eagerly ripped it open . seanick arrived wrapped tissue paper i could already smell it . it smelled great , not girly , but like ocean . i so taken this i hopped shower try it out . bar itself just like picture shows -- bright blue studded seaweed . i could see how some people wouldn't like " plants my hair " aspect , but i like it . bar lathered up quickly lots bubbles . i actually kind fun washing my hair once . i put little conditioner well , half what i normally use . i towel-dried my hair , it actually squeaked . pretty clean ! my hair dried , it nice fluffy . believe it or not , it actually curlier my sister said it little lighter . all good things . i use lot product my hair , so maybe it cleaned all off . anyway , my hair feels silky , shiny , soft . i even used it body soap ! what nerd ... i love whole idea behind solid shampoo think it would great travel . i highly recommend this anyone , especially if you limp boring hair . my only complaint awesome smell doesn't last ..	1
i bought this while back used it primarily shampoo/shower gel . i recently put my hair through lot processing worried what this would my perm/color . well , one day i ran out shampoo used this . not only it not ruin my hair , but it made it look smell great . no more heinous perm smell . w00t	1

this truly best highlighting products i tried many high end cheaper products out there . this so light just doesn't get all cakey greasy . i tried so many brands claim look natural , but they just don't . this really don't let price fool you either . it only takes alittle lasts long time , so well worth price look it gives . i love this !	1
philosophy great products , including this lemon custard lip shine . it great product tastes great too ! they matching shower gel body souffle too	1
it non-irritating works . although not effective tretinoin product keeping hyperpigmentations bay , i notice it helps keep my skin plump . it emollient without overly so light enough wear every day . cream little more emollient if your needs require it . i use this every day after cleansing my face	1
i don't know who writes descriptions , but this perfume definitely not sweet . if you find yourself drawn fragrance notes commonly found men cologne you love this fragrance . it unique it feminine but strong woodsy ( i think it oak or cedar ) tone it . it isn't heavy though , fact it very light , very clean , subtly floral , subtly spicy oaky . all all , modern unique fragrance	-1
i agree previous commenter scent doesn't continue post-bath ( which may good thing if you wanted apply different scent , or bad thing if you hoping smell like vanilla afterwards ) also , i wouldn't reccomend just shampooing this only step your hair care regime ( extremely convenient 3-in-1 great travel but not everyday . ) definitely use conditioner !!! but all all it very lovely scent , makes great bubble bath leaves skin silky smooth clean	1
this best conditioner you ever try . i coarse , dry , very straight asian hair this makes my hair unbelievably , ridiculously , shiny soft . i don't know smell though , . . my husband isn't fond it , but boy oh boy this stuff works . i kid you not !!! i tried almost everything out there least expensive stuff i ask " how much !? " none them come close this . only down side lush takes forever ship . i don't know if it would faster order direct . i'm tell you girls , . . try it .	1

this fragrance packs strong punch , so use it lightly , spray it your legs or abdomen , not around your neck . this may why some reviewers aren't fond scent . you'll definitely pick up patchouli , amber , sandalwood . i love wearing this when i big event . i can't add anything atomizer ; i got normal spray bottle .	1

i use these daily after cleansing my face . they wonderful . you feel product working but there no burning or stinging involved , just invigorating toning feeling . scent very nice also . pads thin but generously saturated solution , one pad plenty my entire face neck area . i've tried avon micro peel pads found them too dry . i often used 2 or more time they just weren't moist enough trick . prices comparable i feel you get more treatments out philosphy peel pads	1
just love it ! searching scent like this forever ! when you first put it it soapy clean scent ... while same time hints " just back beach smell !!

ok , i know it gross , but if you didn't think you problem your skin then you wouldn't reading this right now . i tried everything , lots stuff isn't worth 2 cents then there clinique pore refining lotion . this must my daily routine , i even wear it when i am sleeping . how use : wash face , then apply after any serums you may use , but before moisturizer sunscreen , primer , concealor or foundation . not put too much if you planning layering makeup top it , it make your makeup flake off your skin . this not something you would smear all over , only your oily areas ( such nose , chin etc ) . if you use it your dry areas , it make your face look dry . nobody wants face dandruff their black turtleneck . what it : makes your face appear less oily , reduces size pores slightly first few times you use it , but pores get smaller if you use it everyday . it also feels pretty nice when you rub it ( warm tingly ) . it contain salicyclic acid , so it prevents pores clogging . size tube huge , it least month or two daily use . i think this works better than any clean-and-clear product , better than biore pore strips , thus more expensive price . only bad thing this product it may dry out your skin if you use it too much cause flaky skin . one other benefits it reduce amount oil your skin produces throughout day , thus you won't blot or powder pat much normal	1
this fantastic product ! i cannot wash my hair without it . i am so used this towel sucking up all extra water when i just use normal bath towel it actually feels weird all excess water my hair . this also cuts down lot blowdryer time too . i fine , medium length hair this works fantastic me . i highly , highly recommend this anyone who wants save time drying their hair morning get out door faster .	1

let me first start saying i love ' touch ' burberry , i wear it more than i wear any other cologne i own . it very versatile not too strong its fragrance . however , scent doesn't last very long you may spray few more times than usual achieve results last your hoping . ' touch ' first cologne burberry designed leans towards " sour " smell but this case , it works . ' touch ' very romantic , elegant , provocative , sensational all once ... but its effects only minimal . maybe if it redesigned produce long-lasting results then i would probably add 5th star this rating but unfortunately , scene span ' touch ' only leave me wishing .	-1

***** this my daily moisturizer several years . it makes my skin very soft , very healthy looking , glowing . it makes me look radiant . i given it gift my sister other women , they all liked it much i . no one any adverse reactions . you notice difference after just one use . when i've run out used something else temporarily , i always see difference again once i start back up . it close it gets miracle cream . i not wear makeup , so hope jar it . i am 49 years old i think my skin looks incredible . friends i given it also like keep natural look prefer their skin without heavy creams , thick moisturizers sunscreens , or makeup . women i know who fans hope jar like me . we're kind lazy no-fuss " one cream it all " people ; instead one jar something one thing , something else --- eye creams , night time moisturizers , daytime moisturizers , etc . --- we're type wants just one job then it . other words , we don't patience fuss our looks lot , or spend money buying bunches different creams keep track remember use . unlike other reviewers , i love smell , which not perfumey , but definitely pleasantly distinctive . i use it around my eyes also , not allergic reaction . it seems , though , these two biggest problems hope --- distinctive odor allergic reactions among some people . i would suggest buying it first time somewhere you could return it if you don't care it ; although my opinion , this would unlikely , apparently it possible . philosophy now makes version hope jar sensitive skin ; if you know your skin tempermental , perhaps it would better also try this version . i stuck hope jar because it works so well me . it seems expensive , but it not because it lasts long , long time . tw o-o unce jar lasts me six months . i use toner then hope jar that it . i'm my face 30 seconds . plus , it gives me look most women use makeup get , so i think it bargain . ***	1

i love trying out new products my hair also happen slightly thinning hair top my head ( receding corners ) . after seeing this set sephora i tried it week found results mediocre . my hair , which thin not very abundant , feel slightly thicker plump look roots ( especially crown ) but i am sensitive smell didn't like man cologne like scent . shampoo lathers up nicely but conditioner dense doesn't spread well over hair . mouse interesting . it definitely seems make difference volume . overnight liquid makes hair bit messy sleep . case any product , it may work you but it didn't me . i believe changing body/hair inside out works better than rubbing niacin ( vitamin ) topically scalp hair . i would recommend you try it . you always return it if you're not satisfied	-1
my experience this brush terrible . well , first two or three days wonderful . third day , brush shedding bristles like mad into my razor . second week , wooden handle ( which look durable ) cracked plastic sleeve holds bristles popped out -- never go back again . i am replacing this brush , sadly , after 15 uses , i purchasing more expensive brush , i hope better results . *** update , few months later : i didn't replace brush . i super-glued bristle-sleeve back into wooden handle . it eventually stopped shedding bristles , i used it successfully since then . wooden handle still looks like it deteriorate quickly finish continues chip off . still not recommended , since i don't think i should repair product within first few weeks use	-1
this stuff worst smelling conditioner i ever encountered . perfume penetrated my hair not able get removed . it took 2 days before scent calmed down enough it not bothering me its obnoxiousness . i wish i could give it negative rating . i am glad all i used sample not pay money make my hair stink	-1
i using product faithfully several weeks , usually twice daily not seen any difference facial brightening . i would not repurchase this product	-1

i've read so many positive reviews this i wanted buy it so very much . but when i got around actually smell it ... i so dissapointed , i only smell old lady perfume , bug spray , i don't know , something so strong not strong right way . my favourites dior j'adore , red delicious , intuition ( estee lauder ) , try them instead if you want feel sexy powerful	-1
i first smelled this perfume strip magazine . i fell love both bottle , scent instantaneously . i decided when i some extra cash i would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints get it christmas . christmas came went no fantasy , instead i recieved celine dion fragrance . i liked smell dion but still sad i didn't get what i wanted . i decided buy fantasy myself . upon finding it makeup counter i became rather thankful i got other . i think fantasy smells lot like this cotton candy spray i elementary school . mmmm smell like 4th grader again . bottle elegant , but scent juvenile . it'd appropriate preteens , but not grown women , then again , should i surprised ? i suppose scent caters well spears ' followers , 12 year olds	-1
i developed mild acne after deciding go off my regular birth control pill . never acne before , this devistating . i watched all infomercials decided go murad acne complex kit expecting glowing , perfect skin they promised within few short weeks . i purchased starter kit i liked smell products but after month half , i still experiencing bad breakouts . i even really painful acne so deep it takes weeks them come surface ! i continued use second shipment murad because everything i read said purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks . i spent 3 months over $60 this stuff without results . silly me , i going order more but i started reading reviews my only alternative , proactiv . now stuff isn't any cheaper long run but someone else mentioned acne free their review i figured it worth try . i found it my local walreens $19 . let me tell you , i used acne free 2 , two , days saw results i not seen 3 months using expensive stuff . i can't say enough it . i'm thrilled something so easy get would work so much better than any hyped up product . goes show , don't buy t.v.	-1

this soap unbelievable ! it leaves skin soft smooth no added chemicals	1
okay , so our moms said we shouldn't compare , but i couldn't help it once i found sephora powder brush . it hair handles above all rest . used think brush brush brush , which probably why my " rest " includes artificial haired brushes left powdered streaks my face one shed whatever kind hairs it possessed faster than sheepdog august . enough my sad cosmetic catastrophes - this sephora brush made 100% goat hair , fine soft pick up powder allow you apply either pressed or loose powder sleekly smoothly . i say it feels like silk your skin ? it . additionally , brush hairs rounded rather than cut straight across so it " quick " pick-up " consistently even distribution . course , it good looking state-of-the art silver handle . it measures 8 inches - more importantly , it measures up everything perfect powder brush should . - gail cook	1

let me say this best skin care cream i ever used i know fact it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it . i've used it little over year now i won't use anything else . i don't know last time i ever use exfoliating scrub because what this , automatic scrub . it gradually sloughing off dead skin cells you rendering use exfoliaters useless . i must say , it natural funky smell but you adapt very quickly won't notice it after while . you use it once day first two weeks ( while your skin gets used it ) then twice day thereafter if you want . i only use it night sunscreen throughout day because skin little more sensitive sun . caution - this acid cream . i once minor paper cut my finger ( same i use dip into pot ) i still get tears my eyes thinking pain i . this excellent cream i strongly recommend it . it won't get rid wrinkles ( you know there practically nothing market get rid them ) but it soften look wrinkles it give your skin beautiful softness glow . it amazing cream true genuine results	1

this my favourite lush bubble bar . it makes lots bubbles good 2 very decadent baths . it divided into 3 or even 4 baths , but i like lots bubbles so i usually divide into 2 baths . it smells like vanilla candy wonderful . smell usually lingers lot longer bathroom than it me . i dark blue tub so can't really see if water changes colour . i think if it , it only faint pink . it strong smell but i think that part why i love it so much . candy flower top pink , blue , yellow , or white . if you like this i would also recommend you try melting marshmallow moment , which bath melt ( ie no bubbles ) but it also really yummy , lot more skin-softening . this also divided into least 2 baths , still indulgent	1
i totally disagree reviewers say it smells strong like granny ! i don't know what they're smelling , but obviously it not this . it smell little stronger first than it when fragrance settled , but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny i've ever smelled . i always get compliments when i wear this fragrance ( which every day)- complete strangers come up me tell me how good i smell . i recommend starting body emulsion then lightly spritzing fragrance ( 1 spray should trick ) .	1
some reason chicks dig this aroma . i've tried many clognes over many years but this gets best reaction . i'm getting more now request several ladies so i decided write this review . my luck they'll stop making stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just case	1

this product awesome ; nice texture , great tingling feeling , very smooth/clean feeling after use . but i'm not sure if you should use it daily , exfoliators should only used 2-3x/week because they're too abrasive . so just remember . otherwise , this definitley top notch exfoliator .	1

it definitely great moisturizer . if you're looking something thick but not greasy won't make you look like you're frying egg your forehead , this definitely it ! texture also makes it easy apply makeup afterwards . i use it everyday morning time after i wash my face . only thing careful , if you extremely dry parched skin exfoliating daily point where your skin aching , then try stay away this moisturizer until your skin heals . i overdosing my skin benzoyl peroxide , aha acids , retinol few months ago , leaving my skin extremely sensitive . when i put this gel , it would make my skin burn . but other than , you're safe using it daily regular normal routine	1

these bristles just right combination softness strength . however , since i only use this back scrub brush , detachable design not optimal me . after few months , brush-handle attachment point became compromised ( probably all exposure water ) , i found brush would often detach handle i scrubbed my back . this point , many more months down road , brush no longer stays mounted handle all , so i am looking ( non-detachable ) replacement . even so , i recommend this product because it great bristles , also because handle great while it lasted .	-1

i recently started wet shaving ( within last two months ) come regard shaving something i look forward now . i use merkur futura double-edged razor bought assortment different shaving creams try , including prorasso ( italian eucalyptus stuff ) , taylor bond street ( avocado ) truefitt hill traflagar . my top choice trufitt hill hands down . while many people might see $22 expensive , most people need realize very little goes long way . this not like edge gel or barbasol you learned shave . this just requires dab wet brush ( real badger hair brush ) swirl small bowl sitting bit hot drawn water create warm thick lather make you enjoy shaving again . i would estimate this jar last 6 months . looking cost my new shave method ( 52 blades year ( $0.50 each ) , two jars shaving cream year ($22 each ) comes $70 year . compare this blade every other week alcohol-based shave gel ( which dries your skin ) every other month cost $60 . ten bucks more year buys much better shave . i've noticed my shaves take bit longer , but my skin cleared up many bumps i used . i also no longer 5 o'clock shadow 3 afternoon . best all shave closest thing i've ever shave i got barber florence , italy using steady hand scary looking straight blade . this best bet shave cream !	1

( i can't even tell i'm wearing it , except excellent protection all sun rays . ) now i wouldn't without it ! although price $36+ , you only use tiny bit , it lasts long time .	1
pure poison sensual mysterious scent nothing short invigorating . but it something i would only use during colder seasons just because weather brings out scent more pleasantly . spring/summer , i would recommend sunflowers elizabeth arden .	1
i fine hair , this nothing make my hair oily or weigh it down . it helped emphasize my natural wave eliminated need heat-style . plus , no frizzies ! one thing keep mind : this pre shampoo treatment , so make sure you use it before you shower then wash it out . your hair shouldn't get too greasy if you wash it out . you also warm little your hands pull through your ends hydrating styling product . smell little " unique , " not bad exactly , but you always wash it out your favorite-smelling shampoo . however , whole line ojon good , so i'd recommend shampoo , conditioner , styling cream too .	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1

i hesitant spend this amount not see results . well , proof pudding , so speak . strivectin works . i much heavier one point my life , i stretch marks show it . while they never really bothered me before , i thought i'd give it try , summer around corner . i'm just 3 weeks use they fading . literally . while they haven't vanished completely yet , i am quite happy results . they drastically faded so far , lost ' silvery ' look before . they recommend using this product up 6 weeks i plan doing just . simple easy . guess what ? you even use this product your face ! they make claim it " better than botox " i would agree . something you normally , like putting lotion far healthier , simpler saner . although it doesn't bother me ; minty scent could bother some people their face hence they've released non frangrant eye creme . love this product	1

i love lush - always ordered it amazon we no local store . this means it hit miss me i cannot preview scents . this one hit !! this one their smaller bubble bars , but still plenty two baths jacuzzi tub . smell yummy hollywood style bubbles - you know kind pretty woman !! lush pricey , but i never bought any other product makes me feel like i didn't fight get bubbles - like pouring half bottle . if you haven't tried lush before , this one great starter !	1
if first you don't succeed ... play around until you get better result- different approaches seem work individual lush users . like most lush products , ocean salt scrub may take little getting used ( may behave differently depending what type water you ) but it lots fun play delivers good result . probably not people who want streamlined beauty routine accomplished fast , but if you like play ... scrub smells looks amazing vodka/citrus combination definitely helps dry up blemishes . i sensitive skin this helpful once week usage- any more than my skin gets tight irritated begins flake . one final note caution : this scrub serious when it says ' salt ' , so don't use it or near broken skin . bath body works started using sugar their scrubs this reason , but salt great effect clearing up problem skin tends help where things aren't seriously broken	1

these replacement sponges dermanew system . each sponge includes foam top section comes contact your skin plastic bottom section snaps securely your dermanew applicator . sponges very effective applying dermanew dermabrasion creams . very gentle skin just right amount pressure . each one also lasts long time if you clean it after each use . but because wear tear bacterial growth they should replaced periodically . dermanew system great ! (see my review it ) sponges excellent . however , i deducted one star because i feel $4.00 pricey item .	-1

this razor best virtue me its ability cut thick beard without clogging like multi blade cartridges out there . i always dreaded shaving after hunting or fishing trip . even old gillette twist-open requires it partially opened properly rinse out cream whisker sludge . this guy nice round cavity underneath each cutting edge allows water wash everything away . even shaking it bowl clear it most time . if it should clog , one blow it out quite easily . i only used lower settings , they all i seem need good blades . gillette blades sold us horrible , btw . use merkur blades or swedish gillettes best shave . my only complaint alignment marks match up top body faint , adjustment marks not line up properly , i am forced math get repeatability . i higher expectations german engineering price . this thing overpriced what it , but good shave worth lot , you only buy it once	-1

i am also fanatic sandalwood products searched world ( literally ) same . i found this brand slightly different than one might expect sandalwood , but still very pleasing . little pricey , but not more than expected sandalwood . i've also tried their after shave , soap , shampoo . i've very satisfied all these sandalwood products continue purchase them until i find something better .	1
i love this foundation . i warm sand moisture rich foundation . it incredibly smooth , long wearing color makes my skin look bright radiant . bobbi brown makes very natural foundation colors there range colors all different skin tones . when i'm shopping it seems most lines cater lighter medium skin tones , but bobbi brown really come through flattering options all skin tones . only draw back this foundation not provide adequate spf protection , even though it says spf 15 . therefore , you still need wear sunscreen underneath least spf 15 . i use this foundation every day i wear sunscreen paula choice ( which i love ) . i think color options available , long lasting color smooth texture make this foundation worth price .	1
this very complex scent , mellows after wearing awhile , but still leaves subtle scent quite while . especially effective worn body lotion shower gel	-1

never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1

our local macy recently offered free skin typing samples go it . i really only went pick up free moisturizer i've found some judicious sampling you don't pay item . instead , i fell love this soap ( got free moisturizer too-hooray !! )when sales rep first handed me bar soap , i balked . i've known people who've used clinique but just idea washing my face bar soap freaked me out . they offer liquid version but rep told me soap better exfoliant . i can't say sure if that so but i say this really great face wash . i addicted after one use . since it bar soap , you'll get really great sudsy foam . it mild , pleasant scent it washes off easily . i mild version i just love it . my skin feels clean but never tight not only it not cause breakouts , it immediately calmed one i . i'll definitely buying more . i want add , however , it drying wintertime if you normal skin i switch cream cleanser . it may not problem oily skin . dry skin , i'd really avoid it winter least . you still ideally need makeup remover before soap . i also became recent convert clinique rinse off foaming cleanser . but even if you don't want use product , remember removing your makeup separate step .	1
my first thought crumbling some this into my running bath it reminded me bubble baths when i kid . there this really nice subtle clean smell this bubble bar . i really like it not overpoweringly smelly bubble bar . it great those who don't want flowery bath , but who can't tolerate overwhelming patchouli blue skies bar . i wish i'd bought two these instead one this one blue skies . plus , this good bar mixing bath bomb . really probably any bomb would . good stuff	1

this first bronzer i actually finished . this gives most natural finish blends really well . i like it matte because i'm not fan sparkly bronzer . ever since i started using this , i'm just addicted can't live without it . it gives skin really natural , healthy-looking flush . i've got medium/olive skin i use " light " . my skin doesn't look orangey or dirty . try it i'm sure you'll like it . make sure you use really good brush .	1
i hooked sebastian shine serum forever . then i switched this after hearing all rave reviews . it makes it just shiny sebastian , but my thick wavy hair , it easier apply . i only need quarter size amount , way less than any other product . it nice soft finish . so if you like sebastian redkin shine serums , you'll like this . i'm not going go far say it miracle worker . it makes your hair shinier . it helps little my frizz , but doesn't depouf .	-1
i use both this mascara lancome flextencils when i'm going out , flextencils first then coat hypnose . my lashes look huge not too clumpy . flextencils add great length , while hypnose adds volume . i use hypnose itself just average day . great product ! makes my lashes big not clump	1

this far best shaving product i ever used . yes , it pricey , but if you get past , you won't disappointed . i hesitated purchase this months b/c price , but my friend gave me sample try -- i hooked ! it decandent creamy , little goes long way . i also used spend more money expensive razors get closer shave ; i now only use cheapie razors my legs so much smoother than before ! i also use this under my arms no irritation ( this hesitation , i very sensative skin ) . fragrance amazing well . sweet , name , but not overpowering . this works very well layering benefit other scented products , or their maybe baby fragrance , they all smell similar enough compliment one .	1

all i say this product great , because my indian heritage , i got dark circle around my eyes after baby my dark cirlce got worse . i looked so tired older dark cirlces . i bough lot products cover my undereye dark circles , but i not happy all . i keep trying new concealers but no satisfaction all . one day i went store they sell bobbi products , i just looking powder matched my skin tone bobbi brown . they got me right powder color she asked me try out some bobbi brown creamy concealer my dark cirlces . i not sure but i let her try it me . i so happy see my dark circles gone . i keep getting compliments how fresh i look makes me feel pretty . since than its my all time favourite . little goes long way . i think its great people serious dark circles . i got little kit small mirror , included yellow based concealer little darker creamy concealer even out yellow concealer your skin color yellow powder finishing touch . you just get right color concealer your skin complexion . its little expensive small kit but i love it its money worth	1
i know this reviews clarifying lotion 2 but i thought i would let people know new product clarifying moisture lotion 2 . i dry , sensitive skin when assessed girls clinique counter i came out skin type i/ii . i use extra mild facial soap , clarifying moisture lotion 2 dramatically different moisturising lotion . when i looked reviews here amazon i suprised find so many people unhappy product , but i happened go clinique counter other day found australia there two ranges clarifying lotions , original , which what everyone talking , new moisture lotions . according sales assistants new moisture lotion developed asian market alcohol free asian region australia luckily gets both . they exfoliate like regular lotions but there no sting or tingle skin feels really soft . my face feels like polished marble moment my makeup going staying much better than before . i tell you my skin never looked better since starting clinique i would recomend this skin care line anyone .	1
not only this gel smell terrific , like real raspberry sorbet , it functional well . this lathers up nice you don't use lot product . you use it body wash , shampoo conditioner i suppose bubble bath too . so makes it four one . i take this trips because its easy grab put my overnight bag i take less product me . i also use this when i'm running late take quick shower . this also comes many other yummy scents . try them you not disappointed .	1

white linen classic fragrance daytime use . it fresh , crisp scent perfect summer , when heavier scents " turn " this my first " young ladies " scent , remains one my favorites . other white linen items : powder , body lotions soaps wonderful layering this perfume . because it so light , you can't overdo it . its crisp white blue packaging , it makes lovely gift anyone	1
there i waiting shaving my legs water tub draining away when suddenly i looked down noticed all these little glittery confetti hearts . so cute ! nice surprise i didn't see them while i taking bath . i see little candy flowers floating . this bath high " cuteness " factor if you one those " everything pink " moods , then think pink may suit your candy mood . lavender oil , tonka absolute , vanilla neroli oil makes this calming bath leaves you little happier . you may enjoy this bath even more calming sweet " honey i washed kids sweet honey soap " or " sultana soap " bar which sumptuously smooth leaves fragrance your skin lasts all night . if you want pink/vanilla soap , then you may want " rock star . " if you into mixing matching according scents , then trichomania mildly scented coconut looks like vanilla shampoo bar it goes well vanilla scented american cream conditioner . i vote tad more vanilla , although you toss little vanilla oil bath or some vanilla kitchen also works well . eating sugar cookies tub optional . ~ rebecca review	-1
i'm picky my lipstick . not only shade great ( not garish or sparkly ) but i want it smell pleasant ( or not all ) , taste pleasant ( or not all ) i want case feel substantial click when i close it . ok -- so how this one measure up ? shades awsome . i like baby lips natural lips . it smells ok -- kind like vasaline -- but only faintly . estee lauder lipstick much stronger perfume smell lacome tends smell fruity . it tastes faintly like chapstick . case relatively heavy it clicks . neither taste nor smell off-putting but because i'm so picky it only gets 4 stars . ( texture smooth well it doesn't feel heavy your lips . ) if you want natural ( not sparkly ) lips everyday this good choice	-1
i love trying new fragrances , when i came across this yesterday tried it , - i became hooked instantly . it beautiful perfume somewhat floral fruity same time , but isn't too overpowering me , lasted quite while . packaging great . it fresh looking pretty , but it fragrance itself hooked me . i got few comments it right away , so i think i'm going back store buy some . it might little too heavy hot summer days , but perfect winter . i think this definately suit cooler climates better , or if it too hot , it probably become sickly too strong . if you like blend fruit floral , this you . it stunning different . i love it	1
my hairstylist accidentally bleached my hair too much . if wasn't bad enough , end week i noticed my hair visibly dryer lost its shine . i used this " marinating " oil overnight - slept plastic shower cap . i surprised how easily it washed out morning . there no " oily " residue weighing my hair down either . i very impressed results , it put shine body back my hair - i've only used it once , they recommend overnight treatments once week - i'm expecting even better results end month . i'd definetly recommend this product .	1

i've noticed products lush stores almost always smell different when you get them out store . store , i didn't like smell this shampoo bar all , but i bought it because awesome softening benefits seaweed . when i got home try it out , smell much nicer subtle . i guess all smells store take over you can't smell actual product accurately . this shampoo wonderful . only needed three strokes bar down my below-the-shoulder length hair my hair lathered up really nicely . just sure keep this shampoo bar ( all shampoo bars ) out water when you aren't using it or it turn into mush . took off star because traditional bottled shampoo much easier convinient work store . really nice take you trips , though . if you want shampoo conditioner bar , try hybrid or godiva	-1

okay , so 80 bucks seems like lot money plunk down at-home microdermabrasion kit ... especially when everyone homedics ' oreal marketing more cost-friendly version what appears same exact thing . however , experience ( lots money not-so-well spent ) taught me , most cases , you generally get what you pay . case point : few months ago i finally made decision trade my 99 cent ultra-black mascara high-end name brand version same product ... i immediately discovered mascara-induced racoon eyes really avoided ! who knew ? after , i vowed never pinch pennies when it comes beauty . now there , course , some exceptions ; my mother swears oil olay -as i- but when you're talking microderabrasion , proceedure cost much $150 per session , it hard believe you achieve same exact results something mere fraction cost . skeptical but desperate youthful looking skin , i opted splurge dermanew facial rejuvenation system . prior my purchase , i fair amount research so i knew what i getting cr�me de la cr�me more than twenty-plus versions i choose . just two weeks after using it , i began notice my once sallow complexion ( thanks stress , lack sleep yo-yo dieting ) replaced healthy glow . now my skin looks soft peachy , kind like it when i twelve ... you know , when youth beauty effortless ... sigh ! all all this product best someone little no skin flaws . those who expecting miracle results or results similar what you would get full-service salon treatment may dissapointed . my advice , shell out necessary funds order get your skin under control , then use this product upkeep . this great removing dead skin regular washing tends leave behind .	1
