i offered one these while cycling thought it very tasty . so good , fact , when i got home i went straight web site show back wrapper learn where i could buy them . just above web address nutrition ingredients list . probably mistake manufacturer part it gives you something read while site comes up . oops ! this bar whooping 25% your daily allowance saturated fat ! not only , but fat palm oil . this might acceptable soldier involved prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt cardiologist would recomend it most us . commercially formulated product more likely fill average person need lower fat ( healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated extreme physical activity , sold profit marketed patriotic tribute troops . bottom line : read label , weigh health risks if you want support troops , there better way than eating hooah bars .	-1

i bought two boxes these luv diapers ( thats 448 diapers ! ) i sure wish i spent little extra pampers swaddlers . these diapers leak out top because they don't any elastic tabs or anywhere waist . even generic kroger diapers elastic waistbands ! i am just sad i use these crappy diapers so long ! i also think they run small so i probably not even use them all . what waste ! only good thing these diapers price , but , i would highly recommend you just buy your store brand instead if money issue . p.s. i don't like huggies either because they leak out legs ! hard find good diaper	-1
i suppose it serves function people bad eyesight or something . but ...... dear god thing ugly	-1
i happy see this type product available , but not happy when i received it . it seems like flimsy piece plastic , " magnets " looked like they painted , gold-tone , paint looked like it chipping off . base item separate top item , which seems attached springs ? it run , but very loud , like it working too hard . there note not use it more than 20 minutes , which i'm not sure because potential adverse affect user , or because unit might overheat . there some spelling errors outside box ( few places said " reflexology " few places said " relexology " ) -- but maybe just bothers me ? i think it also important note buyer pays shipping , if returned -- also pays return shipping charges ; when combined , nearly equals original cost item . ;o (	-1
i really wanted like this product after reading all their hype how quick easy it . not . motor it heats up quickly thing stops working . you wait 20 minutes it cool down it start up again . but time you getting results one area your foot , thing heats up stops working again . i went through four intervals effective operation , heat build-up causing it quit , waiting long time it cool off before starting up again . finally i decided it isn't worth time aggravation , even though it produced good results during intermittent periods when it worked . one more thing -- when i gave up decided return it , i took my duracell batteries out they blazingly hot . i worry it might possible batteries explode hot-running motor . i've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this . update : found something much betterafter returninng artemis , i tried medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance . this one costs 5 times price artemis but soooo much better it well worth it . medicool plug-in electric much more power than battery operated artemis . it variable speeds , 5 different sapphire filing attachments , enough power operate long you need . sapphire files different shapes sizes should last lifetime , whereas artemis requires repeated purchases its disposable filing heads batteries . so over time costs owning artemis add up -- if overly hot motor not burn out . if you serious callouses corns , like i , medicool pedisenso very serious , rewarding job . i'm so glad i found it i am grateful relief it provides	-1

before you buy , sure check where pen made . i number older cross pens say " usa " near top , they great pens . however , i bought three different ones past few years not indicate where they made , they inferior quality . top bottom halves loose , carefully manipulated come together without gap . first one i got , i sent it back cross warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only receive it back unchanged telling me it just fine - " handling fee " attached . i willing believe it simply anomaly , one bad pen . so later when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only see they same quality defect . my advice : if you want good cross pen , go secondhand store buy one made usa . they aren't making them same anymore .	-1

i thought this hot air brush would make things easier not hold round brush blow dryer . it great idea , but it just doesn't work well . first let me say i shoulder length , normal hair , but lot it . if i air dry , it slightly wavy . i used larger two brushes found it couldn't get through my hair . so then i using second hand try push hair against brush so it would curl around it . didn't work very well , i wound up burning my hands more than once . i also found i couldn't get same nice curl this hot air brush i could get using regular round brush dryer . other major problem brush got extremely hot . if you idea you'll able change larger brush size smaller ( or unit without attachment ) or vice versa , you won't without getting burned . attachment -- even end blow dryer itself -- simply too hot touch . i doing things like using hand towel try change attachments . size shape unit also not optimal . i found it too large awkward use . off button located right where your hand , so it easy bump . also , there no cold shot . if you've come appreciate what setting curl , you'll probably miss it like i . additionally , person mentioned , unit very loud . you would wise buy couple foam ear plugs if you determined keep this brush keep your hearing . i don't believe i read any warning noise , either . it much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer . time wise , i found i spent much longer trying get my hair dry , then i wasn't fully satisfied style well burns hassle involved getting there . i gave this try few days then returned it store refund . it made me appreciate traditional blow dryer round brush . some things just not good they seem .	-1

this review covers fb11nr : same unit slightly different control pushbuttons ir remote . somehow , i deluded myself into thinking spinning massagers under each foot powered . nope ... basically just built-in plastic versions those usually wooden massaging rollers one rolls one foot upon . that fine , yet when i want relax , i'm not thinking moving my feet . fortunately , those removable , removal exactly what happened . killer center massage wheel , which supposed powered supposed spin , d.o.a. this unit went back store , we bought fb21 instead . amazon no listing model , so i can't give full review it . it good enough keep . both fb11nr fb21 share some traits . neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature . sound levels vary fairly quiet quite loud , depending upon operating mode chosen ( i db measurements fb21 , but since amazon doesn't list one , you don't get see them ) . fb21 seems slightly better build quality , everything worked out box , so we kept one	-1

idea fantastic . fact i don't wake up immediately like bzzzz--i'm awake . amazingly i hit snooze regular alarm without ever knowing it . this alarm , light starts glowing gets brighter brighter over period time you select . i mine set 15 minutes , usually time light reached maximum i'm coherent enough get up . if light doesn't it , you add sounds ranging buzzer screeching sea gulls -- ocean , wind , ringing bells falling somewhere . flaws : others mentioned , light itself makes buzzing noise low light levels . so when it first pops morning , you also get annoying filiment vibration lamp . secondly , you don't set alarm when you want get up . you go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want wake up how long it take you get point . then you set alarm earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use sound addition light , it increase volume light increases intensity , but sound starts out so loud begin light really pointless . workaround we've found this use external speaker provided . plug it into back light , run it across room , bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick sound like " birds " instead lip-curling " harbor " or " town " . it buried location across room , sound hits right volume time light maxes out . whoever came up plan making sound come light just not thinking . fourth , clock lumination change colors , rotating through entire rainbow all night long its default setting . first looks cool . until you realize bright yellow clock glowing your face 2 a.m. just wrong . darkest setting red , only way choose it hit pause button back when it rotates around color . so yes , it works . it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but design just plain stupid . if manufacturer would wander here , read this make few design changes , they could make light worth buying	-1

i pretty excited try ion hairdryer . i got this one because i liked idea able ' control ' amount ions coming out . my hair seem little shinier after using it ( only reason i gave it two stars not one ) but my hair felt little drier . almost straw-ish ... it never felt like my old drier . also buttons really hard switch ... all them ! i read review said i thought well how bad it ? i dry my hair round brush my right hand dryer left . i turn dryer off during different times while i am doing my hair . this dryer i could not turn on/off switch my left hand . i put down my brush use both hands . i could not believe how hard it switch ! this main deciding factor returning dryer , it so frustrating not able switch it easily flick your thumb . not mention made me feel like big wussy !!! speed setting only two settings , low high . low setting way too low high setting way too high . middle ground would nice . lastly , dryer smelled little weird . granted , i only it two days before i returned it , so smell might eventually disappear . but it wasn't your normal ' new hairdryer , hot plastic ' smell . it almost slight mildew smell . yuk . so , i would not recommend getting it . i exchanged it vidal sassoon ion sensor dryer . seems working better . low speed setting perfect . smell normal ' new dryer ' smell so far . buttons easy push !!!! sensor ( it automatically turns off when you pur it down ) little off , it takes while turn off . but all all i like it . it also make my hair shiny not make it feel drier or like straw !	-1

this thing comes lots attachments , which i regularly used only 2 . vibrating cuticle pusher silly . far all those round discs , it hard explain physics this , but suffice it say since it rotating circle , you only use half it time or you'll experience bump-bump-bump . thing rotates such speed ( even lowest two speeds ) even leaving your toe or finger moment or two create burning sensation . what i use smallest pointed attachment , which i used lightly go around my nail close cuticle . this good when you're wearing clear nail polish your nails starting grow out . you lightly buff down ridge polish . same goes edge where acrylic meets natural nail . other attachment i used , though less frequently , bigger cone-shaped one ( kind looks like shape foam ear plug ) . i used lightly go over my largest toenails thin them down since i trouble ingrown toenails . again , it challenge not create burn when doing so . nail dryer thing silly useless . if you manage cram your hand into little scoop without smudging polish , it doesn't much anyway dry your nails any faster than just letting them set . buy little fan like they use shops if you want faster drying time . this thing isn't gonna it . other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails . it likely because they tried use all attachments ( which you'd think you should able , right ? ) . much regular buffing your nail thins it down weakens it too much . bump-bump-bump round attachments likely doesn't help , either . couple times i used this acrylic nails . i tendency wear acrylic nails few weeks then hate them want them removed --- i'm no longer willing subject myself soak-and-pry method nail salons . so alternative soak home , or just trim down myself then thin them more natural curved shape until rest acrylic grew out . however , i mention i this only couple times . that because apparently acrylics bit too much challenge this little " deluxe manicure system . " after sounding like it ailing while it filed down length 2 acrylic nails , it gave little bzz then died . i waited while see if maybe it overheated . i tried other outlets . nope , dead . so i'd pronounce this unfit natural or acrylic nails . if you want something quality acrylic nails , invest dremel tools salons use ( just sure get one low rpm or foot pedal attachment ) . if you want something quality natural nails , go drug store get some sandpaper nail files , rectangular buffer , cuticle pusher . sometimes best solution simplest .	-1

i first bought standard , then large size attempt pair fit well . i used them riding bike winter months . neither pair fit well there most likely very few people who obtain good fit . goggles snug enough prevent wind entering ( prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above ear . rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses motorcyclists .	-1

i finally received this product mail after knowing it year . i can't say i'm huge fan deepak chopra . he presents some good ideas , but what i tell he seems consider meditation more mechanism mind body control , leading bliss relaxation , rather than tool unbiased self knowledge , come terms all things one rather might ignore . i find this bias reflected game . game itself , it pretty good - its graphics its originality - learning relax chill out may useful some people . i didn't find process compelling i expected , though . i found i able learn some skills pretty fast , other places i seemed get stuck . one potential drawback if you get frustrated , try start forcing things happen , it defeat purpose meditation . science biofeedback fairly new , i see its potential field preventative health . i just wouldn't put same new age spin things chopra .	1

now i'm writing this review , it seems silly i'm so happy over such small thing toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i my first ( hopefully only ) root canal crown four years ago , something which i never again want experience my life ( someone else described , it painful expensive ) . growing up , i didn't take care my teeth like i should've , so i'm accustomed always told there either cavity , or start one , more work . after root canal , my mom recommended brush least certain number pulsations/oscillations , because that what she'd recommended her dentist combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , it affordable . when i first started using it , my gums very sensitive it , but quickly wore off , so it seems me it strengthens gums . it also much easier get behind front teeth . subsequent dentist vists my mom shown her gums improved dramatically after using high-quality electric toothbrush such this one ( i honestly don't remember if she this exact model , but ours similar ) , i've not needed any work dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . far cleaning unit keep it " gunking " up , i'm only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads still package they came , not dripping into storage container ; so i don't know how combat . but i just take toothbrush head off thing rinse it , then rinse hand-held part , set them back unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it when battery runs low ) things stay clean no problem	1

bad news first : doesn't seem work well without adding extra detergent it seems like this not 3x concentration , like others we found we compensate adding more detergent than directions said get same results we standard formula . otherwise , two products , ' concentrated ' ' standard srength ' same . make no mistake it - this concentrated comes out like heinz ketchup : it seem concentrated , we notice certain amount difficulty getting detergent out bottle , kind reminded us heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? standard strength product clearly 5-star product , however owing fact this product not work well without adding more detergent than direction claim , it rates 4-stars our family . trying learn objective info laundry detergent well . . . . following true this product standard strength or 3x extra detergent added : i am allergic most laundry detergents , but this product prevented severe discomfort me 10 years . it consistently among lowest-priced detergents available . addition very easy clothes skin , it work quite well stain-removal department used its own presoak . this good know if you like me trying avoid allergens . it important remember if you buy hypoallergenic powder detergent instead liquid like this , you may pre-soak stains you won't hypoallergenic liquid which it . while " tide " " cheer " also available hypoallergenic formulas , [ " tide free " actually just unscented ] they considerably more expensive work no better my experience . that why i like this " all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent " . objective information tough find ! i actually conduct hard target search true , objective information laundry detergents . there very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , not what i trying find . " consumer reports " test comparisons most popular brands its monthly magazine every couple years they include some detail . " all website " if you looking this product website it under " unilever " you specify " usa " under products , word " all " show up almost every search result . you find " wisk " " breyer ice cream " almost many neat name brand products you would procter gamble site .

this unit power transformer wall socket end instead handheld part . handheld part mostly made plastic . so , it pleasantly light hold , much lighter than my wahl homecare thing . supplied guard things ( you swap change length , etc . ; iirc they range 1/8 " 1 " ) curve bottom so it easier them glide over concave surfaces instead digging pointed end into them . this also makes things more pleasant . don't believe no-mess story , though . it really catch most hair , so it certainly worthwhile , it easy empty hair trap , but i still vacuum remainder afterwards . it doesn't catch it all	1

... i purchased this item remove some debris off my camcorder lens found it job very nicely . microfiber texture feels nice - little beady , but soft textured . using it easy , i just wiped lens circular fashion light pressure eventually debris gone . ( some fingerprints what appeared scratch but wasn't)the packaging little subpar though . it comes plastic bag which you tear open bottom slide cloth out . however doing so leaves adhesive residue , which cloth then sticks you tear it off , making those sections cloth appear phyically different - bit roughed up i'd say . this poor design packaging says store cloth inside bag when not use avoid contamination , so i used scissor cut bottom bag adhesive residue off . i've yet machine wash it , but so far it works well . it just cheap lens cleaning cloth after all	1

i purchased caruso my wife after returning conair infinity . conair infinity not measure up her expectations . she happy caruso feels it good job setting curl . i offer few observations my own . i would think companies produce these devices would more sensative needs broader spectum customer . instance , women different lengths hair . this device provides 6 petite , 6 small , 6 medium , 6 large , 6 jumbo . might fine women shoulder length hair , but not everyone . there not enough one size get job . there not enough two sizes get job . if your hair just cut , it short use larger sizes , unless you long hair start . my wife hair not quite shoulder length , she got problem . so , i figured , no big deal , just order dozen right size . one dozen additional rollers cost $35 . i only paid $29 unit 30 rollers . that not what i call customer friendly .	1

dentist over 20+ years experience , i seen over over again results not flossing one teeth . unfortunate result such neglect cavities ( especially kids ) , inevitable gum disease adults , which both cass over time leads tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between teeth only way clean germs cause gum disease cavities teeth floss . mechanical scrubbing floss key , all daily brushings rinsings not remove in-between stubborn plaque below gumline . bottom line we need floss our teeth if we want keep them lifetime . i heard all excuses not flossing : floss too hard handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers too fat , i'm too clumsy , floss hurts my gums , etc , etc . this disposable flosser great kids , who may not dexterity load non-disposable flosser , such " flossaide dental floss holder " , which i recommend adults ( see my review ) . i recommended this floss aid my young patients over years i strongly recommend it you well . one still develop habit flossing daily , this device aides mechanics flossing , making it breeze . get it save your teeth ! jim " konedog " koeni	1

i few minor quibbles this razor , but it gives you nice close , comfortable shave . isn't what we want end ? i don't know anyone who buys one these things its " ergonomic design features . " it holds charge good long time , shaves your face nice . rinse it clean running water you're . that what i'm looking . only things keeping me 5 star review i'm not yet comfortable how razor sounds when running . it seems like it always needing charge ... but that how it sounds full charge . it take some getting used i guess .. others might find quiet running mode plus . also , monthly cleaning cutters/combs bit complicated .	1
upgraded this razor after my old remington died , i've very happy it . it cut bit close , which irritated my skin first , but i think just me getting used " lift cut . " this would excellent razor if it wasn't two features ( or lack thereof ) make it pain use . 1 . internal battery nicd . this type battery " memory " it , which means optimal performance , battery should fully drained before you recharge it . otherwise , life battery slowly shorten until battery useless . 2 . there isn't low battery indicator . itself , either these features wouldn't pose problem . combined , you're left wondering when you'll charge shaver , or when you're off business trip , if you'll need bring charger . long run , this razor cheap enough i expect battery last years . still , it would better if battery made nimh or some technology that not 15 years old .	1

replacement blades must . razor remind you once year which fine most cases . but , if you heavy beard or shave more than once day , i , then you should replace blades every 8 months or so . reminder razor only suggestion , not command . after all , it not know when blades get dull . so , i simply ignore reminder replace blades when i feel it necessary . one thing you must use new blades several days until they settle adjust your skin . until then you may little irritation . problem i solved hair my neck . i use think harder i press razor , better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got rash . i discovered if i simply use very light touch not press hard then it got those hairs much better no redness . replace your blades least once year your face thank you	1

i very satisfied monitor . it easy use seems quite accurate . i disappointed find when i opened box there no instructions included . quick phone call them way . i able use it without instructions but could not set time , etc . all-in-all it quite satisfactory device	1
i like portability adjustability this mirror . it takes up little space stowed away very compactly . it serves my needs very well . i disappointed only magnifying mirror lit . i tend use normal mirror more often . other clock loses it setting when i stow it away . it reset left out if you really wanting use clock feature . far i am concerned ... i looking mirror really could care less clock	1
i using this razor 6 years now , probably long they out . they may pricey but well worth it . i used use disposables nicked/cut my legs almost every time . i switched these maybe nicked my legs very little . it so quick easy use , my legs much smoother than they ever disposables shaving creams . they only last 3-5 shaves , but if you figure price disposables shaving cream , it probably not much more expensive	1
i not overweight many years , but i still last 5-10 pounds just not stay off . i several issues eating - i tend eat very large portions when i am really enjoying meal , i snack lot , i major sweet tooth . this product taken care all 3 problems . i am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times day . i plan cut back little once i'm my target weight . i find this dosage generally suppress my appetite and/or urge eat 3-6 hours . it odd me experience hunger without cravings frantic urge eat ... but that what pills me . most time i tell i'm hungry only because my stomach growling it several hours since my last meal ... but i don't feel like i eat anything right away . i go grocery shopping when i'm hungry not make poor choices , even when i finish up gym after work i don't feel ravenous anymore . i definitely get full faster . it doesn't feel like it used when i overate , i just tell i've eaten enough i stop . what concept ! often i just bite or two good 30-60 min if i'm too busy sit down eat . my urge snack really curbed . i still one or two snacks most days , but they much smaller often more healthy . now i actually stay up several hours past dinner without making mini-meal , which i used almost every night . hoodia not completely kill my appetite , it suppresses it quite bit but more than anything it takes away all my cravings . definitely my favorite part - i used crave sugar morning until night practically every day . since my first day these pills , only time i've sweets when someone offered me something . i'm able eat just little not wish ten times more . it not occur me go vending machine work anymore , or buy candy when i'm shopping . maybe even more than weight loss , emotional benefits these pills incredible me . i'm no longer berating myself constantly overeating or too much candy or dessert . i'm not depressed all day anymore because my favorite pants gotten snug , all i think why i don't willpower prevent it . i would definitely recommend this product , especially anyone who issues food like i	1
tape measure , it what it says it . you press button tape tightens around your body part . you won't worry , " i hold tape tigher last time ? " tension always same consistent measurements every time . tape starts measurement 2 " since tape casing holds tape part measures around 2 inches . i think this tape accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats regular tape measure since least button ensures each time tape wraps around you same tension level	1
first all , let me say this product great almost every way . so if you need feel better your nose and/or throat , go it . my main complain grossan hydro pulse it noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan making just his own irrigator tip matching it waterpik machine cost half price hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided produce his own machine , if i'm right , viajet making it him . viajet sells same machine , except grossan tip , -again- half price hydro pulse . breathe-ease solution you might use irrigator also expensive ( i check this comparing it simillar product purchased my country ) . so what makes hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health business , after all . other than , like i said , this product great almost any respiratory problem . i used irrigate my nose similar solution comes 135 ml bottle , intended use it over 50 times . hydro pulse lets you 500 ml clean everytime , so you get idea . also , if you suffering respiratory problems want chek interesting drug-free treatment , look buteyko method	1

i purchased this dryer replace older one far too loud . while this new one much quieter than old one , it really isn't super-quiet . still , i no complaints noise , but flimsy wall mounting hardware story . threaded holes mounting plate extremely fragile , so much so they both wrung out during initial mounting dryer . it didn't help any mounting holes extremely hard locate once plate mounted - it hard see thru white plastic shell . i ended up discard original threaded screws use two slightly larger metal tapping screws mount dryer bracket . this worked fine , but original mounting hardware isn't very well designed my opinion . other than dryer seems work very well , although i haven't it long enough know how well it last . all all , i'd give dryer 4 stars out 5	1

i found this product after reading review it hairboutique.com . length my hair seemed reached plateau just below my shoulders after year seemed grown no longer . i decided try this product see if it worked . hair growth normally clocked 1/8 inch per month , i decided monitor results my own little " clinical test . " this actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i'd easily able see how much growth there each month . i ordered box viviscal which i paid $49 ( average price web ) set take first pill following morning ( box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair night before so one month i'd able accurately measure how much growth there looking growth since colouring . results : i didn't really notice anything until around 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails growing very fast/very long . i weak nails split easily they barely seem grow all . it very noticeable because i use computer all day nail growth causing my fingers constantly slip keyboard . never great nails , i pretty happy see this . my curiosity also getting better me i could see roots my hair pretty clearly which unusual 2 weeks after coloring . i took tape measure measured almost 1/4 inch hair growth . this would mean 1/2 inch per month 6 inches per year . i pretty excited because although numbers seemed small , it twice rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair becoming unusually greasy . because i very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm . well , 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth it exactly 3/4 inch . not only but i constantly trimming my nails this point . i totally ecstatic . but also this point , i washing my hair every day - it no longer dry brittle , it much softer , but there no way i could miss day washing it or it would greasy . so - conclusions i reached my test this : 1 . yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth stimulated over twice speed . 2 . viviscal also makes your nails much stronger grow much faster . 3 . viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you wash it every day - then it fine . it not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought bit strange ( though good !!! ) . i recommend this product	1

i am biochemist education teaching physiology university . such , i am very knowledgeable chemistry human body general . i really like neutragena products this product certainly very high quality . most people , i think it offers great protection , but not best protection people who need very conscious sun exposure possibility skin cancer . according my dermatologist , recent studies shown spf 15-30 wipes off after few hours doesn't offer adequate protection after time . this partly due most people not using enough . other words , they underestimate how much they need apply get level protection . this reason , neutrogena spf 45 or 55 better . also , neutrogena ultra sheer products updated include technology called helioplex . most dermatologists i know feel this makes difference effectiveness some people this going very important . i used both this product higher spf helioplex formulations . practice , i found both adequate my needs . what i particularly like you don't even know you product . it virtually no scent it really so sheer you can't even notice it . both these products stay long time good all day use , but my understanding helioplex formulation even better . further , it feels exactly same skin . only drawback it bit more expensive . this also good product because it protects against both uva uvb rays . both implicated skin cancer it important protect yourself against both . if you looking everyday sunscreen this might one . however , if you want very best protection try neutrogena helioplex spf 55 . this give you most peace mind	1

now i'm writing this review , it seems silly i'm so happy over such small thing toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i my first ( hopefully only ) root canal crown four years ago , something which i never again want experience my life ( someone else described , it painful expensive ) . growing up , i didn't take care my teeth like i should've , so i'm accustomed always told there either cavity , or start one , more work . after root canal , my mom recommended brush least certain number pulsations/oscillations , because that what she'd recommended her dentist combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , it affordable . when i first started using it , my gums very sensitive it , but quickly wore off , so it seems me it strengthens gums . it also much easier get behind front teeth . subsequent dentist vists my mom shown her gums improved dramatically after using high-quality electric toothbrush such this one ( i honestly don't remember if she this exact model , but ours similar ) , i've not needed any work dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . far cleaning unit keep it " gunking " up , i'm only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads still package they came , not dripping into storage container ; so i don't know how combat . but i just take toothbrush head off thing rinse it , then rinse hand-held part , set them back unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it when battery runs low ) things stay clean no problem	1

this variation classic pre-shave lotion , but solid form . main ingredient parafin , petroleum destilate grounded very fine powder molded thru extrusion into solid bar . once it touches your face skin it pulverizes again remains skin fine lawyer talc-like powder . contrary apparences it lubricates skin almost flawlessly . course if you press electric shaver much it burn your skin ! nonetheless this high quality product ( made switzerland ) why rather expensive side , but it certanly delivers 100% its intended use purpose . i always keep 5 o 6 bars one time stock , because i know it too good product before it substituted chinese cheaper import	1

i actually bought this book based all negative reviews it not enough " fill blanks . " i wanted baby book would give me topic let me journal it without too much prompting . there few fill-in pages ( see below ) , but most part i write my feelings thoughts my baby my own words . this seems like much more personal approach , one i think my son appreciate more when he old enough read it , than fill blank pages . previous reviewer complained pages thin newspaper-like . true , they simple white pages black titles , but pages themselves not all flimsy -- thicker than average novel page more like lightweight cardstock . illustrations small , simple , non-intrusive . black white line drawings more iconic than cutesy . my only complaint this baby book i would like more topics ( birth story , tooth chart , food , favorite expressions , favorite toys/games . . . ) however , pages look like they 11 " 8.5 " it bound ribbon , so i think little creativity , cardstock hole punch i may able add my own pages . topics covered ( one full page allowed per topic ): baby name ( fill blanks)family tree ( line illustration fill blanks)all momall dadexpectationsparties showers ( 2 pages)first impressionsbirth certificatehandprintsfootprintslock hairvisitors giftsfirst family photofirsts ( fill blanks)baby favorite thingsdoctor visitsgrowth chart ( fill blanks)medical records ( fill blanks)first birthdaysecond birthdaythird birthdayfirst vacationholidays celebrationsletter momletter dadkeepsakesreflections there also small pouch baby first haircut , pockets back store cards , documents other loose memorabilia	1

i loved idea clapper . i live alone so clapping sound wouldn't bother me i looked forward convenience factor . my first clapper lasted 4 months then mysteriously stopped working , but dead unit smell suspiciously funny - like electrical short . i learn my lesson ? oh , no ! i went ahead purchased clapper some months later . night before last , lamp i connected this one started blinking . i checked lightbulb it ok . it only went i got down close clapper plugged into outlet i heard dreaded sizzling sound saw flash electricity . once again clapper crapped out , this time different lamp , different outlet . i never learn ? thank goodness nothing happened due highjinks this faulty device . you say " housefire " ? again , how dumb am i ? unit ul-approved , if so , any other complaints lodged it ? how one find this out ? i like my gadgets , but " buyer beware " this one	-1

i tested this scale against several others none nearly accurate . i moved this scale around house tested it wood , tile , carpet . it always accurate within . 1 lbs , just advertised	1
this great scale very accurate . i no problem this . i also difficulty turn it first , but after i read manual , it easy . it very accurate 9/10 gave same weight . 1 pound ( one off . 2 pound ) you need tap it making it vibrating . don't just tap since it won't turn , but if you tap it just like you softly hit it so top glass vibrate , then it .	1
i love these because they're delicious just thing getting me through long workout . they're also perfect traveling , easy pack , sustain you during all day hike or touristy walkabout . friend mine iraq says he eats them twice day , taste , also because -- i agree -- he trusts energy product designed military soldiers much more than energy product designed private company profit	1
reading some these comments , after sampling hooah bar , i understand why these bars give you long lasting energy . they're oily sugary . lots sugar quick energy oil stays stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that why much fast food so popular , it tastes good its satisfying , but it ain't necessarily good you ! recipe makes it sweeter , certainly oilier , than eating ordinary candy bar . i think snickers tastes better . those who using these meal replacement bars , i'd real careful . bar might ' balanced ' but it isn't meal . whatever energy bar you consume , they're good before workout or post-workout recovery but don't confuse them proper meal all components found there . me , i prefer odwalla bar or cliff bar . less grease , true natural ingredients , less hype	-1
out 3 flavors available , this one favorite both my boys ( 4yrs 7yrs ) . but no matter what flavor its snack they both eat enjoy !	1

this energy drink perfect those late nights when you need mental boost get you through few more hours work . writer often under deadline pressure , i've relied caffeinated products like coke red bull years , but invariably they make me jittery i hard time focusing . not so hooah drink ... like friend giving you leg up onto something , it helps me make it through more work than i could my own , my brain doesn't feel all frazzled like neurons midst aimless firing frenzy when i drink it . my focus actually improves , which makes sense given it designed keep soldiers alert through life or death situations	1

these bars supposed women because they lower cal more calcium . i think there other factors well . men usually affraid products like vitamins women stangely enough , but they say they need calcium protein too . i really like key lime flavor it great . i like lemon also chi tea . i like those flavors because they light tasting i not always chocolate way some people . lime reminds me florida keys . these really better than original cliff bars when they came out i not eat man ciff bar . i used eat one these breakfast everyday soy milk when i busy life . thankfully my life slowed down now . it good grab go food	1

while i love scott brand products ... i don't think this package such great deal .... this price works out $1.60 per roll !! i thought buying bulk supposed cheaper ?? you buy 4-pack around $3.00 , well , least you here florida ! total waste money .. unless it necessary you buy bulk . maybe $20 off special it may worth it ? i'm agreement fellow reviewers ! scott changed ( don't you just hate when companies fix what isn't broke ?? ) their toilet paper now stiff , scratchy feel .. guess that why they came up extra soft version . yes , it seems they weld start sheet roll now .. i think they want you use up half roll just getting it started .. make you buy more more frequently !! i think i'll pass this " package deal " .. i don't money flush	1
i using this product regularly couple years am very pleased it . i notice difference when i begin my healthy day source life shake fruit . due my job , i rarely get lunch break time ( usually late ) morning shake stabilizes my blood sugar carries my through lunch . now several my co-workers using it well . they pleasantly surprised flavor compared other health drinks . i mix it blender bananas , sometimes mixed fruit , lots ice . i also add good squirt flaxseed oil . one co-worker likes it banana , coconut milk , apricot nector pineapple . i highly recommend it very broad spectrum healthy nutrients one good tasting drink	1

i purchased this panasonic oral irrigator take when traveling . since i prosthetic device my lower jaw , i need way keeping area clean . it kind hard lugging regular sized water pik when traveling . this portable unit worked great me . it easy fill handle , water pressure sufficient job . i would even consider using it home daily . very satisfied this product .	1
panasonic ew1270ac portable oral irrigator works well removing anything left behind after flossing , seems it clean any pockets gums flossing cannot reach . only downside two aa batteries not seem last long . would recommend rechargables	1
i am very happy way these wipes perform . they seem gentle they very soft - almost like felt . price great when you babies tow when shopping physical stores you really appreciate large/heavy things like this just appear your door ! wipes container comes extra covering after you raise hinged lid ( presumably help keep them drying out ) my only complaint would when you pull wipe through little opening sometimes " chain " wipes fall back you take whole top off thread them back through opening .	1
i only used this couple times but works great . no problems . it maybe little heavy some numbers attatchments little hard read but aside it cuts great . it runs quiet i found it easy use never this myself before . well worth money .	1
i like green tea diet pill many reasons . first , it causes bored eater ( that'd me ) eating aimlessly throughout day . secondly , since i've taken it 2 half months i ( actually this started happening within few weeks continued ) , capsules helped shrink my stomach probably half what it used , so when i eat , i don't overdo it . keep mind when i say stomach , i mean one your food drops into , not your waistline . however , no means am i saying there no weightless physically . there ! so far i've lost 15 pounds . some you might thinking , " well that surely exercise , i'm not one time , or i hate exercising . " you know what ? those you exercise you'll lose even more weight than me 2.5 month mark , because i go day day doing general stuff , nothing like walking or jogging miles or riding bike . however , i've figured few things key those aren't too keen exercise ( word alone makes me shudder ) . if you don't time exercise routinely or very long , or you just hate word " exercise " ( i know it cause terror within few us , don't lie ) then keep these things mind when you take this amazing pill : -going grocery store ? don't go when you're hungry don't park closest building spot ( unless it dark then it scary ) . obvious reasons , don't go when you're hungry , you'll just end up popping everything into your cart ( some stuff you don't even know what heck it when you get home unpack ) . instead , i'm sure you know this , maybe go after dinner or after lunch . what get ? that few paragraphs down . -going shopping ? word make you giddy delight ?... only until you realize you really don't money doing it ? alright , here solution . go mall or outlet stores or wherever else it you could spend hours looking around stuff . park furthest building spot , leave tempting ways payment either home or your car ( hidden stealth ! ) , go building window shop ! spend least half hour doing this however long ( though you'll get kicked out if you try stay past closing time ) . if you think it weird exercise mall/store , it really not . i know i've seen few power walkers my mall it totally obvious what they're doing , but thing you don't . exercising this way easy just browsing stores , circulating mall , bypassing food court ( unless you need water ) checking out potential christmas gifts while getting regular workout ! -play your kids least half hour day ( outside) ! play hide seek ! run after them ! shoot hoops ( not only it exercise , it helping hand-eye coordination ! ) , throw few balls , kick soccer ball , play swing set , walk around park while your kids play ! there so many great activities family bonding time you get easy workout , too ! it win-win both you your kids . -no kids ? pets next best thing . i three dogs one cat . they're sweetest , most evil things entire world ! not only they make me take run my money ( literally , cause they steal my shoes anything else they get take outside ) they also warm my heart make me laugh smile . 30 minutes playing your pets great way help amplify effects this diet pill ! -have good laugh . find your funny friends , people , laugh much you ! you lose loads calories way!there definitely more small things help you lose weight , especially when taking this pill , but what what food right ? stay away carbs . period . they not your friend all time . especially since they let lose all things your fatty cells need keep their greedy little lives prosperous your thighs/stomach etc . must them ? i know your pain . instead start getting used whole grain wheat . don't shrink terror , it not bad ! eating habits , especially bad ones need rethought when taking this pill best results ! well , that my review , little what i've help you get your way better , happier , healthier you ! i hope this helped least some people ! this how it worked me , but keep mind , every one body unique special it own way it likes losing weight , so just find niche you're good go ! good luck !!	1

there so many varied reviews this product depending which version you clicked ! here what i've found mine : first , this intended work adult acne , occasional blemish . sorry teens , this probably isn't best choice you unless you only occasional break-out . second , this only works new pimples so when you get it , don't expect ones you currently suddenly disappear . it works best when you first notice pimple appearing , especially just starting get sore , slight red spot stage . sad , it actually work , provided you keep first two rules mind ! two days after i received mine , i noticed tell tale red spot beginning form , i zapped it not only it not get worse , next morning , it completely gone ! plus , portion pink version goes breast cancer research if you buy it company ( not sure amazon ) there 30-day money back guarantee . all all , great product	1
food mill very handy . i didn't bother using it my first two kids ( i'd received one hand-me-down friend ) . it seemed too much hassle . fact , it really simple . i use it daily my third child wish i'd experimented it few years ago . our pediatrician encourages us give our child what we eat , not depend gerber or beech nut too much . problem it difficult mash ( spoon or fork ) foods like banana , avocado , potato , small curd cottage cheese other soft foods consistency my child eat ( super smooth ) . this food grinder you . it really easy clean simple tote around . i'll even mill several foods during one sitting , cleaning it food types - it easy take apart , clean reassemble . response other reviews this site , you put cooked chicken into it , or crisp apple , but these won't become smooth yogurt . , you'd add water chicken , possibly add some other blending agent like potato , use electric blender . apple or carrots , you'd need cook it before you could put it into mill it would become smooth ( like applesauce ) . milling foods like corn peas probably result some residual solid bits ( skin pea or kernel ) . completely rid food , you'd use seive ; even electric blender would yield some solid bits . this product probably most useful children ages 6 months 1 year	1

before i bought this product i given sample pack featuring art shaving pre-shave oil , shaving cream , after-shave balm . they called it " one perfect shave " they weren't kidding , really . this far best shaving cream i ever used . though i highly suggest using brush , cream still lathers beautifully or without one . it bonds each hair like rubber glove protects my skin like no other . i never any irritation , none . scent , my girlfriend wouldn't want me use any other kind . sandalwood screams " male " lasts long time . i never buy any other shaving cream	1
first what i like it : it helps suppress my appetite , when i eat i feel full faster . i take 3 day , not proposed 5 day . i taking it month half now , legitimatly lost 5 pounds ( this isn't just fluctuation , i accounted ) . i didn't increase or decrease my work out activities . i swim 3 nights week half hour . i before taking pills , didn't swim any extra days after taking pills . what i don't like so much : bottle says take 2 morning , 1 lunch , 2 dinner . seems so excsessive , pills huge kind hard swallow . this rate bottle only lasts 18 days ( 90-count bottle ) . also after taking it month half straight , 3 day , no skipping ... i went out town weekend forgot pills . well let me tell you , when i got hungry i felt like i hadn't eaten days , i starving . hunger came back like times 10 . so beware ! all around i would , buy it again . maybe month half too soon judge , we'll see	1
this little guy his job pretty well , but pain refill . it pretty much every day or two , it drips quite bit when you lift it out take sink . i would probably buy it again , but bit drag .	1
not much say other than this great product . it similar myoplex lite ( peanut butter crisp too ) bars , but much lower sugar content	1
my initial impression after using it two days now favorable . my gums bled lot , but might because i've never brushed my teeth this insanely till now . i believe manufacturer claim you ' brush 40 seconds ' fairly accurate , here why : because it uses 6 brush surfaces time ( instead 1 regular toothbrush ) , it truly time saver respect . you certainly feel like you geting more out your typical 1 minute brushing you ever before . someone really thinking outside box when they designed this thing . big advantage this product ( me ) , you still only spend 40 second 1 minute per brushing ... vs . 3 minutes+ product like sonicare . i just didn't see myself making commitment keeping it over long haul ( just realistic ) . also , this product requires very little skill properly position ( just bit down , hold hydrabrush two fingers , so it self-pivot ... whereas sonicare other electric brushes require 30 seconds per quadrant you must skilled enough aim it angle it ... sure , not hard , but if your using bad technique , then yours also not doing good job . i accidently run it high first time , before i realized low second click over , not first click over , which seems kind counter-intuitive me . i should looked unit closer , it shows " 2 dots " ( fast ) shows " 1 dot " ( slow ) ... they tried , but i still got it wrong somehow . result my first use high setting , my rear gums bled lot . this documented instruction seem normal ( bleed first few days ) . i think fast speed ultimately what i want use , but slow nearly effective still quite workout teeth gums . clearly , slow best newbies like myself . i write this , i still feel my gums they feel like they got quite workou t.t he brush unit itself quite big , but brushes smaller than expected , which good thing . pictures online made these brushes appear quite huge i wondered how i'd room it all my mouth . some people small mouths might potentially issue using hydrabrush . some people small hands might potentially find holding it bit cumbersome . it works fine me , despite large size . my kids saw me using it today after work they like " wow dad , thats cool " ... " it looks like it really good job ! " . i read brushes not easy put take off -- but it seems fairly easy , not really hard . i wouldn't want share electric toothbrush anyone first place ! i took them off clean off brushes little better , so i removed brushes pressing small metal pin each brush head ( there two brush heads totaland pull ) pulling each one out -- not hard if you ask me . putting them back simply : push , click ... its , then repeat second head . i worry litle dual motors holding up over time . it seems like motors almost bog down times my rear molars , esp . low speed ... but it keep going . you bite down little less it seems relieve motor strain somewhat . i've noticed this mainly only observed after week use . fully charged , it powerhouse . i'm trying see how many days it'll last single charge . so far , two days still going strong . its doing lot work , so i perhaps worry batteries won't last long . i say it " feels " like i just got out dental cleaning , most part . you know , its good , clean feeling -- but also one where you feel bit abused . my teeth gums feels pretty beaten up just 1 minute . i say i perceive 1 minute brush time very effective , based how clean it feels after such short period brushing . it feels like brushed lot longer than i . i hope my gums get used this stop bleeding few more days . bleeding never lasts long , which i think good sign . i read somewhere this toothbrush not waterproof , appears true , it came ' water shield ' go around brush unit , just below where brushes attach . this seems work pretty well it doesn't seem come loose . so far , unit staying dry little no extra effort my part . i don't really use included holder or case , i just set unit side sink ( small washcloth ) so it drip dry into sink . thats just me . unit charges overnight they tell you not overcharge it beyond . it blinks while charging then stops after its charged . they says its good something like 40 uses , which i'll surprised if thats true . i'd happy if it lasted 20 1 minutes sessions . i've used it 5 times thus far . using hydrabrush consists holding unit two fingers ( loosely ) then biting down somewhat brushes letting it glide down your teeth somewhat its own . you push pull it somewhat , but you don't angle or work brushing technique all . this truly gadget which could turn us all into brushing idiots . this quite strange , but seems pretty easy it hard imagine people hard time using it , after adjusting its strangeness . small amount toothpaste i put into each brush seems get stuck take little extra cleaning remove after brushing . maybe i'm not putting right . owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste ' optional ' -- strange . feeling i get after using hydrabrush -- " wow , my teeth feel really clean " . i don't think my back molars ever brushed this much vigor before . i guess real test ( comments i get ) my next dentist appointment . update : bleeding gums long since stopped hydrabrush still going strong original ( first ) charge . i'm very impressed brush , it appears doing good job my teeth . i'm hoping good comment my dental hygienist my next visit . i've also using waterpik ... its also very good product . no , i haven't tried extra reach brushes . since my teeth badly worn down childhood grinding , i fugured my teeth too short require those brush heads . i think i'm getting plenty coverage basic heads , but i could see how people better teeth ( taller teeth ) could require extra reach heads . hydrabrush finally run out power initial charge -- i would say i got good 2 weeks charge , if not more . one minor concern come up after using hydrabrush , amount noise it makes , esp . when using bedtime , when others might already asleep . it gets louder more drained batteries get , so it might more motor strain noise than anything . i've noticed fully charged batteries more quiet . i'm still impressed how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute brushing . i believe its time i write review amazon , not i've some time use this product . i would add hydrabrush would probably not so great little kids , since brush itself quite big might too much little pallete , little teeth . probably ages 10+ would appropriate . update : i since switched high speed setting . i would also say ( me ) this product , like water pik , tad messy requires you brush over sink , so water toothpaste drop into it while brushing . it not major amount , but i find controlled ' drool ' while brushing almost necessary , unless you stop middle . i just drool complete it 1 minutes or less . i advise using included rubber ( waterproof sheath ) included , it keeps water running down onto handle while use . since unit not fully waterproof , using this mandatory my mind . i buy this see if this device " real " , or just infomercial gimmick ... but i'll say , it real ... if you go into it open mind some flexibility little noise mess ... this really nice job your teeth . replacement heads cheaper than sonicare well . four pack really two complete replacement sets . two pack single replacement set	1
this radically different toothbrush , but it didn't take me long get hang using it properly , my teeth feel cleaner then they ever before . i really am glad i bought it	1
these things work . once you figure out how use them . all you carefully hold each end finger tips , using nuckle each finger raise or lower lip , center lay strip across teeth . use your finger nail tuck into spaces each tooth , making sure keep fingernail space tooth you just tucked before you move onto next space or tucking it into one pull last one out . once you it couple times , it smooth sailing then . i not think you find whitener this easy use this reasonably priced , actually works very , very well . i'm smiling you right now so you see what i mean . ;] , impressed aren't you ? i know i i definetely buy this product again . i also recommend it all my friends who not bright smiled i now am . your self favor -- get this ! kim schil	1
decent nail brush . i purchased it clean out assorted grime accumulates after day construction , it fairly well . i wish it stiffer bristles , also some problems grimy water getting inside body brush , it constructed two pieces popped together . this not issue anything but aesthetics , however , it not effect function brush .	1
we bought rechargeable batteries all sizes use wide array baby gear our son . we these particular batteries his swing crib light music toy , they last weeks charge . these definitely save us money long run less wasteful than single-use batteries	1
this wooden foot roller massageris excellent product . it lightweight , inexpensive , provides easy way simultaneosuly relax rejunvenate tired , achy feet . it wide enough roll both feet it , let acupressure balls work their magic .	1
bought this razor my husband christmas . i looking something replace battery-operated aramis he used years very disappointed when it finally stopped working . he loves this new braun pocket go ; used it almost exclusively since he got it . it not only excellent job - which you might not normally expect battery-operated razor - but it perfect size . thanks , braun	1
so far , these fit bill . just used them first time -- find they easy put , comfortable -- better yet , don't interfere jewelry they would if they hung off chain/rope/string	1
i've used it past 7 years i still get compliments way i smell ... so , i keep buying it ..	1
i waited couple weeks write this review so i could let my face get used new razor . background : i used norelco rotary shavers since i began shave teen . my skin always sensitive any time i tried non-rotary shaver my face would become red irritated . i also felt i getting closest electric shave possible rotary shaver . sometimes i go several days without shaving much i liked rotaries , they not well heavy beard growth . switch : whenever blades needed replacing my rotary shavers i would buy whole new razor . price replacement blades almost much shaver itself . my most recent norelco served me well but recent months shaving became dreaded experience . norelco uses motor rather than vibrator like most other shavers it tend slow down when blades dull beard thick . decision : although i never luck non-rotary shavers i tried friend braun once surprised how much closer it shaved how my face felt good afterward . his cheap $29 model i would happy it , but i liked style model 5775 . anything more expensive seemed just more gimmicks . i simply cannot see what would justify over $100 electric razor . review : this closest shaving razor i ever owned it actually makes shaving pleasure . wider head way various slots arranged lets me shave gliding razor over my face . no pressure needed . bad : it feels big heavy ( which taken positive ... feels remarkably well built ) . swivel head pure gimmick . it doesn't swivel during normal shaving seems useless . braun could made shaver smaller , lighter fewer parts prone break if they left " feature " off . highly recommended - excellent value .	1
one best shavers braun made long time many options use . you use it just like it , brush it out then rinse hot water . option you purchase clean charge stand . also you purchase 12 renewal pack which comes cutter block foil , 12 cartridges your clean charge stand . also they make two cases 5775 , one square soft case they also make hard case . you buy protective cap foil , clean out brushes . i using braun shavers over 50 years . i presently own 5775 model braun i highly recommend it anyone .	1
i purchased this use desk chair my office work . i basically interested heat feature . heat massage turn off after 15 minutes . this described safety precaution but it highly annoying re-set everything every 15 minutes .	-1
shaver great price . it provides very close comfortable shave . no problems . i not checked battery life yet , but soon	1
used variety shavers remmington , norelco braun , panasonic es4025sc far best yet . most obvious improvement how quiet unit operates . others sound like buzz-saw , but you barely hear this one . it especially effective body hair , but also works well facial head hair thicknesses . panasonic also never bites , often occurs other shavers . unless they discontinue this model , i never buy different shaver again	1
shaver fantastic , most reviewers agree . however , after two months gentle use , cleaning stand stopped working . braun telling me send it repair shop but , luck would it , i can't find my receipt so i can't get it repaired under warrantee . even if i could find receipt , i would send stand my expense . i bought this shaver because i felt i would buying quality . i am product designer profession i feel this product not worth money , especially light their repair policy . if they stand behind their products , i would fine this failure , but , it stands , i regret buying this shaver i doubt i purchase anything else braun	-1
this product works great , i use it while pregnant . it not contain dea which studies showing may cause cancer interfere fetal brain development . i love smell too !!	1
fountain pen well balanced elegant look it both modern yet timeless . only drawback i would preferred finer nib - med nib flows nicely very even never skips but would liked finer line . too bad it not offered option	1
reviewed using cross converter waterman florida blue ink : inexpensive copier paper , this pen medium point writes smoothly wet , never skipped . it starts instantly after days capped , weighted sized perfectly adult man , excellent grip . converter screw-in , safety deal all converters should use . section barrel threads metallic finished - if not all metal - threads not too loose or fine . very slight closed-cap looseness doesn't effect performance . posted , it looks much more expensive than it , current amazon prices ! lifetime warrantee .	1
i really like this dryer . it dries faster than most leave my hair softer than my previous blowdryer . it takes moment or two it heat up , but never gets so hot it would burn me . i love two attachments able complete 3 types styles without problem . only negative ( others mentioned ) " cool " button . it not uncommon fingers rest it while styling then all my heat gone . it need better usability testing	1
wow i no idea id saying this but after reading reviews when i purchased this item , after i received used it more than 2 weeks now ... they werent kidding ! this thing dries ur hair really well fast without leaving it dry !!! my hair looks healthy soft throughout whole day . must-buy if ur looking hair-dryer	1
amazon asked me review it because i ordered it . however , i never received it since it seems permanently out stock . so i ended up canceling my order . note . i 5 year old almost identical oxyjet irrigator which excellent although i repair its leaking plastic tube . i also same toothbrush which excellent too . note . i also half dozen other oral irrigators . oxyjet far best . note . ultrasonex better toothbrush . it hard find these days	1
i used various oral irrigation products over twenty years oral oxyjet dlx 8900 far best	1

i really like this scent . it light feminine . also , i like price . you get pretty big bottle price .	1
aside lightening fast shipping , i must rave over this scent ! initially , i knew i loved this perfume ( before my amazon purchase ) sample ad magazine . december , while walking through department store my boyfriend , i decided test fragrance gather his opinion . he didn't seem interested time , so i delayed making purchase . few weeks ago i finally broke down ordered it through amazon . i already run through 1/4 bottle , my boyfriend loves it ! yea	1
this classic fragrance , not your overpowering j-lo , b'spears , etc . i wish i could explain scent ... but it tough describe . it isn't fruity or flowery . perhaps bit lavendar though ? basically , you don't overpower room it . it bit " old-world " -ness it ... but far i am concerned , wonderful thing . i am 31 year old professional , i wear it daily out night , i just love it .	1
this item seems work every bit well much more expensive oral power brushes . i see no reason spend $50 -$90 . even more expensive sonic brushes may worth it , but this one great job	1
it great not tired arm after brushing my teeth . less than quarter time it gets off sticky film i when i'm lazy brushing my teeth . it so good i don't feel bad when i don't floss daily . i'm saying way too much my dental habits aren't i ? it also useful feature signals when you brushing ( around 2 minutes it jumps off couple times ) which helps make sure i get my whole two minutes . charge lasts enough not annoying . but every couple days you test it out listen whether it rotating fast day before .	1
ok , i must warn you i may sound like infomercial , but i am hooked this product my acne problems . i tried proactiv , murad , acne kit i can't think name addition separate topicals ( e.g. noxzema , clearasil , etc . ) none given me results this product gives . i even tried milder version acne free system didn't good results i get severe acne free system . i wouldn't recommend this product those dry or sensitive skin acne . this very drying formula works my very oily face . i never thought my acne severe , but i would always big zit one place or my face would leave big scars after zit went away . now , i not breakout since using this product ( 3 months ) . i hope it works you !	1
charge time quick charged batteries sustained their charge well reasonable period time	1
they garbage bags , so how worked up you get	1
i find these trash bags extremely useful . they really " grip " well ; i no longer any trouble bag falling into when i add something heavy . long you use standard tall kitchen trash lip , it should work just fine . only beef i this bag when i tie it cinched-up ties , it doesn't completely seal up . there always small opening center	1
i am new using oils but these very interesting . just couple drops trick . i especially like lavendar . there enough bottles last long time . 6 fragrances there plenty variety . recomend	1
i'm so happy output . my roommate returned his " bigger one " , bouhgt this one after me . he felt same great output . it also quiet . tank small handy but because high output , it not work more than 6 hours one tank water . i just shut off it before sleep	1
i very sensitive skin , so i am always reluctant try new skin care products . i end up returning too many because impact my skin . this product not only not irritate my skin , it also helped minor ingrown hair issues , good moisturizer well . scent product minty manly , my humble opinion . all all , product worked well me , someone very sensitive skin	1
clock this product not work . light not shut itself off . these both things description said it should . only thing it stay semi-fogless . this rip off , not buy	-1

i quite few thermalon heat wraps am very satisfied them -- good moist heat . i use one back one neck several times week . they've improved waist ties back one so they sturdier . i've given back wrap my sister , my father girlfriend they all like it too . p.s. i always wondered if these review real -- this my first	1
times , this product godsend . if your child fussy you don't know why , just try it .	1
i've worn this fragrance 3or 4 years now , but they no longer sell it stores . i extremely excited find it amazon really decent price well . shipping fast , i chose free shipping sometimes take up month but i recieved my package within week . so glad full bottle again . i love this fragrance	1
replacement blades work very nice provide uninterrupted ionic air cleaning . replacement blades actutally shinner then original blades much easier clean . i usually run my ionic pro replacement blades when they dirty i put original blades long enough clean replacement blads properly , then put replacement blades back .	1
i am very happy close shave this shaver , my previous shaver braun this gives me closer shave less time . it also very quiet operation . my only knock owners manual says charger needs unpluged after charging complete . this quite inconvient .	1
i'm almost 50 using electric razor most my shaving life . when my trusty norelco needed replacing , my wife bought me latest self-cleaning braun christmas gift . i liked some aspects it , but it always hard time shaving my neck area without going back over it lot times . replacing cutter screen every 6 months or so helped keep it getting progressively worse , but after couple years , i thought i would try something different . i read many reviews decided try norelco spectra system . i've using it several months now i tell you difference my neck like night day . norelco much faster smoother than braun cuts very close after only couple passes . i amazed how much better it than even my old triple-head norelco . if i any negative , it would charging system . first problem , if you provide recharging " stand " , then logic ( imo ) should stand allowed plugged 24/7 razor it , without any adverse affects . however , many places manual tell you doing this shorten life your battery . because they use nicad battery , they ask you only recharge it when it runs low avoid " memory " effect associated diminished capacity . i understand , but second problem , it gets fully charged only 4 hours ! after , you supposed remove it , or unplug , stand avoid overcharging . unfortunately , most us shave morning before work day , then don't return least 9-10 hours . my case , 12 or even 24 hour charge would far more convenient . what so hot " 4-hour charge " anyway ?? ok , how i push button start charge cycle , it automatically shuts off when fully charged ! how easy ? ( gee , that exactly how my braun worked . ) electrical engineer myself , i'm sometimes overly critical things like this . ok , if it me , ( you listening norelco ??? ) i would used nimh battery didn't " deep cycled " , then use lower current " trickle charge " base could left 24/7 . side benefit when you pack trip grab your razor , you know it always 100% charged probably enough juice last entire trip without dragging charger . ok , maybe charger not bad i make it out . i just think it could better . i give it 3 stars , while razor itself gets full 5 stars	1
far best thermometer i ever used . i wish i this when my boys little . i don't even bother ear or under arm versions my little girl - such waste time you always doubt accuracy . so simple . so fast . there isn't chance this thermometer inserted too far . excellent product . i highly recommend this all my friends	1
this best , fastest rectal thermometer market . it accurate , safe ( you literally can't insert it too far ) , very fast . i've used five other rectal thermometers , some which cost much more than this one , i say this one best . look no further	1
i originally bought this item use tub cushion while i sit tub giving my infant bath , but it wonderful , very comfortable great just relaxing tub yourself , it could also used regular seat cushion if you so choose . i like it very much	1

homedics bpw-200 smart sense automatic wrist blood pressure monitor works every time without giving us any frustrating error messages . it super easy switch one user graphic displays easy read very intuitive user(s ) . nice appearance , well made , seems very reliable accurate blood pressure readings . we extremely well satisfied highly recommend product	1
i honestly say these only tweezers you ever need . i 900 other pairs when i misplace these , my eyes well up tears thought losing them . freelance makeup artist , i lot eyebrow grooming . these tweezers wonderful very precise . i reach microscopic hairs , you only see 10x lighted magnified mirror , these babies . these tweezers also fantastic splinters , ingrowen hairs , tackling zits ( which you shouldn't doing . . . tsk tsk ) . careful ! they're sharp	1
i absolutely love this lounger . it most comfortable one i've ever owned , design allows me lie face down without smashing my nose or twisting my neck . i even read while lying face down . pillows arranged fit my individual needs held place velcrow . i little trouble folding lounger up single-handedly , but that okay . great features outweigh this minor annoyance .	1
i bought this my son college here his comments : " razor works great . it closest shave i able obtain eletric razor . cleaning base great idea , because it all work you , only thing you remember put it base . my only complaint my base male plug broke off . it probably just random chance accident it happened mine . they repairing it now i am supposed new unit soon , so phillips good . all all very great razor , especially sale price $50 ! "	1
i bought this shaver not long ago i really like it . where you find good shaver this amazing price .	1
i found i could not get close shave , if i working i would shave later day get . luckily i am retired so no problem . i also cannot cut some beard lower part my neck use trimmer cut any long hairs . not good my old norelco .	-1
we bought chrome model replacement basic no-frills showerhead . showers feel pretty good regular setting , massage setting decent too . showerhead easy install everything included except teflon pipe tape which we found necessary prevent leaks when we screwed this into main plumbing . when head resting cradle , it arches up few inches , which makes it nice tall people under . hose also plenty long enough reach other end tub . problem we showerhead not fit snugly into cradle , unless we unnaturally force it . just setting showerhead cradle results showerhead moving when water turned , mostly because hose still curl it . he solved this problem 2 hair clips hold hose still . one word caution -- if you unscrew swivel piece , careful not lose rubber ring , because it falls out easily . without it , swivel leaks badly . all things considered , i would buy this product again , would suggest it long it going used solely hand-held showerhead or solely cradled showerhead . switching back forth may cause frustration	1
i using this cream two weeks or longer quite honest , i don't see any change all . i am very disappointed would not buy this product again	-1
i used this product approx . 3 years now i much prefer it lotion . it works better me i heavy beard it greatly reduces irritation . i use this product until i either change razors or they make something better	1
everytime i purchase this product it never fails me when i shave . it great smelling aroma , it smooth face	1
great tasting bar . nice soft make it easy eat	1
its sooo good . yummy , filling , natural . what more could you ask	1
these great baby meal times , especially when road or travelling . no need cart sticky bibs around or worry washing them ; bibsters convenient job well	1
i tried small box these first , i loved them . this box 4-pack it great saves you money . they perfect because : - you don't clean them . just throw them away . - they way more comfortable my baby than vinil or plastic ones . - they velcro closing ( no sticky band catching baby hair ) . - 2 or 3 these take almost no space diaperbag . - they big enough cover her chest tummy . - liquids don't get through , so baby clothes stay dry . - pocket catches all food doesn't make it mouth . this great , specially now she starting eat herself only half spoons make it mouth . rest just falls pocket	1
i gotta admi t--t he concept great . you drive , you sit nicely cushioned seat cover also : 1 . massages your upper back , lower back , or both , 2 . optional heating unit comfort warmth , and3 . plugs into your auto cigarette lighter . massage conducted though 5 vibrating balls located inside cushion , therein , literally , lies problem . ball located center upper part cushion digs -- annoying , uncomfortably , very noticeably -- into your back , rendering whole massage/comfort angle moot point . well rest this works , it ( heat perceptible , other four balls feel fine , cushion fits snugly around your seat velcro-closed belt ) , one protruding ball makes this uncomfortable experience . i'm taking mine back . positive side , company just one " point " away very good product . if you see this ( or something like it ) , try " test drive " it store . maybe this company ( or others ) place balls better position other products . few other notes : you cannot turn heat independent massage ; , if massager not , you cannot turn heater . also , this not shiatsu-like massage , not this price . you're getting electricity-generated vibration here , two speeds , low high . high speed , you feel more stimulated than relaxed , if somehow one those old vibrating foorball game surfaces up against your back . fact , brief manual accompanying bk-2500 cautions people against using this night , it may keep you awake little while . still , if you like back buzz , you find similar cushion without very uncomfortable center ball ( didn't anyone test this thing ? ) , you might enjoy product like this . but ... not this one .	-1
my back itches time time . scratching one place often makes spot next it itch . somewhere during this process , it reaches somewhere hard reach , you end up looking like primate . use tools , feel human . i , however cut wheely things off back end . pointless , make product overly long awkward . i bought two ; one home one work . best $10 ( w/ shipping ) i'd ever spent	1
norelco seems moving lot its production electric razors china . i one made there , also this one which still made holland . truthfully , they both seem work equally well , but there issomething nice norelco land created them . no matter where they're , they pleasure use	1
i am really glad i purchased this item . weight very accurate i love it gives weight tenth pound . body fat similar past measures i've taken professionally . water , i tend get dehydrated , so i wasn't surprised mine low , but can't attest how accurate it . ( not even really sure what you use measure ) . setup fairly easy operation easy all information it gives . i would more user friendly only step scale , but i think it worthwhile it store your information . i would never need track 12 people , but i love it stores people information separately . overall , i think this great buy especially price would recommend it anyone needing scale calculates body fat	1
i like this scale . it light . it looks good my bathroom . it seems accurate . it memorize height weight information multiple users , so you your family members use it get your percent water percent fat , addition weight	1
these items arrived time described . rayovac rechargeabe batteries aa aaa sizes always worked great me . they keep their first charge even longer than regular batteries so they sometimes outlast them before even needing recharge . i wish larger size rayovac rechargeables good performers aa aa	1
hasta ahora las he estado usando en mi creative muvo tx fm me han servido . es una l�stima que no vengan con mayor amperaje . he visto que las energizer son mas potentes que estas . talvez sea porque las ray-o-vac salieron primero al mercado ..	1
unlike first review this product , i found it great take me whenever i go out eat . it folds down easily fits my purse . i read both paperbacks hardbacks using easi-reader few problems it . only times it seems slip when you just starting or ending book most pages one side holder . i always people coming up me my table asking holder i give it glowing recommendation . i tell them how track it down internet no idea how many i sold company . i orderded more than 20 myself given many them christmas stocking stuffers . i also given many people who work restaurants i frequent they asked holder i used them tips sometimes . i'm sorry other reviewer not find it useful but i really like it stated previously find it excellent my purposes	1

this energy drink really good . ignore reviewer gave it 3 stars because his body could not get used guru all natural buzz . if you fill your body unhealthy artificial [ ... ] then try guru , your body might freak out . after training your body guru natural ingredients , you won't worry jump-off-a-cliff effect unnatural energy drinks . guru soft buzz definitely picks you up early morning , no matter how early you get up . i work 7am shift need get up around 6 . somedays , my brain too comatose morning i need guru start day . somedays , one guru not enough i take half second make it through day . 98% time , one enough . very soft buzz end day . don't drink guru after 4pm or it might keep you awake night . drink tastes like soda water , but sweeter makes your tongue tingle . definitely not feel like soda pop . much healthier too . people should start using guru popular bar drinks instead rolling . much safer sanitary . consider your options - natural better you long run ! i'm giving drink 4 stars because i am field testing drink long run . jury still out b/c i've only using guru 3 months now . good luck your field tests	1

i norelco accutrim beard moustache trimmer t765 little over year before i lost charger . after looking one both town ( san diego ) internet , i decided just buy new trimmer all together . this point , i began some research . originally , i looked exclusively norelco trimmers though my rational solely based name recognition . after reading many reviews comparing prices , i decided look other brands well . when i came across panasonic er224s . reviews this product overall excellent , price appealing well : only 5 dollars more than my old norelco when bought best buy . before we proceed , i should let you know i am more beard growing enthusiast than beard growing professional . while i growing beard year now , i don't now , nor i ever aspirations zz top caliber beard . said , my needs , this beard trimmer everything i could hope . this trimmer improves over my old norelco so many ways . adjustment setter 14 settings beard length up 20 mm over 9 setting my old norelco offered , setting becomes locked once you power trimmer . there additional detail trimmer offers flexibility my old norelco could never offer , it hides away when you aren't using it . er224s also allows you operate trimmer while it charging . this something drove me nuts concerning my old norelco . it just quiet any other trimmer out there my opinion , it best looking trimmer you buy . it simply looks classy . it doesn't built-in vacuum , but i really don't see necessary . what i read , they most often break or performance sub-standard . grand scheme things , how difficult it rinse out sink after you ? trimmer also rather easy clean . manual very thorough explaining ins outs trimmer . fact , only con i think this product rather large charger . however , i trim my beard 2-3 times week , charge seems keep quite some time . overall , i am very happy this purchase	1

i written poor review previously , based only fact it seemed take forever heating pad arrive after i ordered it . time i got it , i no use it therefore couldn't rate actual product . well , company saw my review wanted make it right , so they refunded expedited shipping i'd paid , which considerable . i appreciate customer service like , especially when i didn't even " demand " it . luck - or whatever - would it , i need heating pad this week . dr. thinks i pulled ligament my back , i don't know . all i know it killed me , so i pulled out my handy new product gave it test ride . i love size it , it heated up lot more satisfactorily than my tiny drugstore one i'd using , delivered nice consistent heat . i also like weight it - resting my other side laying pad across injured part , it felt secure comfortable . i like it digital read thermometer , well timer automatic shutoff . ( i'd actually burned my arm my tiny drugstore model , whose pad inside flannel covering plastic - fell asleep it me my arm must've rested plastic part accidentally - i think i gave myself 2nd degree burn !... all better now tho . ) so , kudos company product . highly recommend .	1
i bought this heating pad chronic back pain after trying many other cheaper brands . out box heating pad feels good . its heavy appears well built . it digital readout which shows current temperature allows you set desired temperature treatment time . default starting temp . 124 . which short period feels too hot . this maybe because once heating pad reachs 124 it turns off . but temperature readout shows 132-134 . once unit shuts off when it reaches its target temperature , it cools off very quickly far sensation heat your body . but temperature readout stay very high even though pad feels cool . so you continually turning temperature pad up , so feel warmth . 15 20 minutes you reach maximum temperature you set heating pad , then unit stops heating your . i tried laying unit out flat walking away . after 15 minutes temperature still reads 142 . this problem this pad . what ever measures temperture this pad so very very slow react , unit unable deliver steady heat . this regard its " same old " , no better delivering heat than $10 heating pad . also , forget using pad darkened room unless you take flashlight . digital read out no backligh t.t he pad deliver its promise moist heat	-1
some ways , this more comfortable than mouth guard i got my dentist because it doesn't cover all my lower teeth . other ways , it less comfortable because it very flexible move out place . i like adjustable sides , though . overall , i'm happy it because it lot less expensive than custom-fitted dental device . it keep me biting down my teeth night , which means i no longer am waking sore jaw . minty flavor pretty apparent first , but now i hardly know it there . so it really doesn't matter what flavor you buy	1
i started grinding my teeth night while studying bar exam ( yeah , guess you could say i stressed ... ) . i went through 2 different models boiler mouth guards ( you boil mold , bite it , then immerse water set it ) but really didn't like them , they seemed flimsy . ultimately , i found this sleepguard model online tried it out . it soooo much better ! instead fitting over all you teeth , it just creates overall gap keeping your back molars apar t.t his model keeper . i don't use it anymore because i stopped grinding after exam - either because stress gone or because this trained me not ... but whatever case , if i buy one again , it would definitely this model . i very very pleased it .	1
i bought this product myself 6 weeks ago . i waited this long before writing so i could honestly say if it worked or not . i've used other bite guards leary purchasing one said it would " fit right out box " , but i pleasantly surprised . it actually fit , no boiling or adjusting . it flexible yet firm enough so i don't grind . i never buy any other kind after this one . i highly recommend this product	1

once we finally got this table put together , we loved it . not much say other than it pretty sturdy good quality . but ... i think we would much easier time assembling it if we simply thrown instructions away solved it like puzzle . instructions vague , error ridden , omitted important parts steps . this manufacturer really needs thoroughly test , update , edit their assembly instructions . i believe tables made states , so it not translation issue	1

( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1

amazon notes these bags easy life carry -- they right . black color bags helps make your refuse more private , too . this important this day identity theft . bags drawstrings you should draw tight then tie ; but i recommend you also tie very top part actual black bag itself extra strength so it definitely won't break when you take out garbage . hefty lives up its name extra strong . i tried several store brands but none them thick durable hefty . my opinion hefty brand buy . 33 gallon capacity makes these garbage bags great both families single people . bags economical , too . amazon price they cost roughly 35 cents each that good deal especially because bag usually handle two days ' worth garbage . highly recommended .	1

i first received l'eau d'issey pour homme girlfriend who always immaculate taste , her choices all well received . but l'eau d'issey stands out one gets most comments - all positive - both friends total strangers . it actually become bit laugh my favorite starbuck because frequency women line offer favorable remark ( it happened once or twice others , victoria secret very sexy one i recall , but issey miyake way , way ahead respect ) . like one other reviewers , i men also ask it ( usually some disclaimer start ) . i carry refillable travel spritz when road since i consider this one my basics . it works well but appears leak bit volume - nothing major , it doesn't smell up my toiletry bag or anything else suitcase , but i'll usually run out longer trips .	1
i 12 colognes now this one among aqua di gio , burberry weekend scents - very light aquatic , making it suitable spring summer . issey miayke stands out crowd though , because it works your skin chemistry , until point where you can't smell it but others notice it quick whiff . yes , it last long long time , top , middle , low notes all work together create truly long lasting , quality cologne .	1

i replaced conair beard/mustache trimmer whose battery died , i've very happy it . i like fact it run power supply plugged , not option conair . i'm surprised negative comments other reviews , since i've never adjustable comb ( which controls how long it leaves your hair ) fall off . i agree one combs kit thin , but i like factor . i find it works well me when i'm washing my long hair shower . i use it dump most water prior toweling it dry . if you don't like kind comb , go spend buck or two good , stiff comb or three . i wear full beard often neglect shaving my neck cheeks days , trimmer no comb great knock down stubble before i shave it	1

this gift my husband he loves it ! it gives himthe closest shave he ever electric razor andvery similar regular shave . price best , too .	1
this my second braun shaver . first one lowest model one blade . i loved them becuase i never cut my face their foil design . newer one definitely superior its design though . two blades make it faster shave . it washable , longer run one charge . it not too noisy so i don't wake up whole house . it sturdy compact travel box . carrying charging cable not big problem since it also very compact . moreover it not necessary take cable most times , since one charge most likely last longer than your trip . however braun design some limitations . first all , foils not sturdy . they bend lose form if you not careful where you put shaver it falls into sink instance . nice thing replacement foils available everywhere , affordable . problem foil design it extremely hard shave if your face moist . you'll wait bathroom dry up if you want shave after shower , since water vapor stick your face otherwise . even more important ( now i am re-experiencing , every year ) , humid summer day you need push shaver your face , since there no way dry skin . maybe it better fall back traditional razor such days , but i hate cutting myself so i just stay my braun . all put aside , i find one thing awkward . small button pops foil cleaning placed just bit above on/off button . sometimes ( when i'm not fully awake ) i accidentally push it see foil hit sink . so far ( after 3 years ) nothing happened foil because this , since it extremely light . but it still not best placement buttons . trimmer worked fine me . many people complaining it . so i'll try complain too . only thing i don't like trimmer space trimmer shaver hard reach brush cleaning . i guess i am too picky this last commen t.t o sum up , i love my braun shaver . it reliable long time . i'd give 4.5 stars if it possible	1
o.k. you buy cheap batteries , but not this razor . they nipple thats 3/8 " long fits up into razoryou cannot use conventional battriesin this razo	1
i bought this massager my husband who back leg pain . he panasonic massager 21 years finally gave up ghost , so we knew brand excellent . programs included massager especially helpful neck back which give him relief pain . only drawback sound it makes -- reminds him sounds mri . would definitely recommend it !	1
it such simple idea . take manual razor electric razor create hybrid electrical manual razor cheap price . forget buying any kind electrical razor or manual razor again . this thing works using single aaa battery ( worth investing some rechargable aaa batteries ) which slips into base pulling out end piece . just press green button razor starts vibrate . this vibration stimulates skin gets those hairs prick up little bit so razor blades ( all three baldes , i.e - mach iii/m3 ) catch better creating cleaner smoother cut . honest old mach iii model absolutely great but m3 power razor just upgrades razor into totally new device . there simply nothing market remotely resembles this kind product ... nothing . i would not hesitate sending anyone down local drug store $20 pick up this wonderful product ... quite frankly ... just making shaving enjoyable again	1
i knew when i bought this body fat monitor would just used rough estimate what actual number , so i wasn't really altogether surprised when i found out it 10% off . but , let face it , sensors feet which poor tester body fat percentage . great scale track your weights two different people based age height scale . i really impressed . i like this scale but it might more bells whistles than necessary might lead people astray believing they body fat higher or lower base their body fat percentage this machine alone . if you buy this product , just know it good place learn approximately where you but sure go gym or doctor it correctly	1
this toothbrush awesome !

i bought this item local grocery store . it great encouraging good eating habits ! it just right size keep cut up vegies dip fridge bring out each meal . we like it so much , we going buy least 4 more ( one each hubby i take work , cut up fruit home , third my sister who really likes ours ) . unfortunately store i bought first one doesn't them anymore , so i'm thrilled find them here amazon	1
this actually beautiful fountain looks much better than picture amazon . although it made plastic , it looks quite good much better than artificial grey slate type fountains . other reviewers mention , pump really quiet there nice flow water soothing when room quiet . i wind chimes outside two together very soothing . this fountain lights up lovely yellow illumination . dark room it quite attractive fits into even very upscale decor . cost them item low overall i think my 5 rating well-deserved	1
not much say besides fact they long life . i use them my boombox it sounds sane if i'me plugged into wall socket . i use these bateries all time	1
get this wonderful heating pad . you won't regret it . heats up fast very reasonable	1
i like cottonelle , but i prefere packages fill one container each , rathar than these larger packages	1
this stuff best !!! absolute must nursing moms !!!	1
this best cream i ever used . suggest it anybody .	1
i tried other less expensive brands , pampers still best one . these soft absorbent even overnight . overall , great product	1
my 2 yrs daughter likes dora prints this so much she chooses wear this pull ups rather than elmo pampers cruiser or underpants ( she now potty training ) . absorptivity wise easy ups not good cruiser	1
replacement heads norelco razor makes great shave . i haven't used electric razor years , figuring you could not get close shave . i wrong . norelco shaver awesome	1
desciption not mention product not used url coated lenses , which serious omission given many or even most eyeglass lenses coated	-1
use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed also use nivea men face wash other days . i've using this routine year now my skin never looked better . after using face scrub my face felt comletely clean soft . i highly recommend this product	1
i love this heating pad . it so great heat up bed before i go sleep . i am able defrost my icy feet sleep soooo comfortably . best part it goes off after two hours so i don't worry burning my feet or burning down house . this second one i purchased . i first one many years i guess it just wore out . i used it almost every night colder months . i wish i not thrown it away because i found it it came very long warranty i might able replace it . this time i'll know	1
i would rated it five star , except control made overly complicated . i think ten settings heat then many settings how many hours two , four , six hours or continuous --- why make it so diffcult operate . instuctions , goodness , almost useless !	-1
this very inexpensive fountain i don't think it would realistic compare it other much more expensive models . it made out plastic , but it blend into decors easily long it not very close viewer . lighting quite beautiful you adjust flow water . price , i am quite happy it not think it much nosier than other more expensive models . pumps usually all same or very familiar . however , it very important keep water level up distilled water . if you don't this you get ruin pump , make it run nosier because wear , etc . i think it great fountain office or mood lighting bedroom . if you expensive furniture , you may want get something made out slate or better material .	1
it works just like it says like you would expect it . i can't ask anymore product	1
comparing multi-blade razors , mach iii best : far easiest clean , best balanced , most securely attached handle-to-head . these things -matter- , shaves otherwise fairly equal . if you must : i used double-edge ' safety ' razors years , before there -were- cartridges . if you tough hide , or master barber , fine , but regular guys continue get cut regular basis old style . mach iii shave you just close , you never get cut	1
1st wahl trimmer i purchased failed within few weeks . i posted my review amazon contacted soon after wahl representative . he offered opportunity change my opinion product sent me replacement unit free charge . i buy different brand trimmer when 1st failed but it wahl i depend everyday use . replacement trimmer doesn't cut short length i prefer . wahl 11 position guard more than adequate . i use level 1 cut that few days more than stubble look . i tried stubble guard but didn't really need it . battery life very good . i use trimmer 3-4 times week charge it after 3 weeks or so . it also used while it charged . i quite impressed someone wahl took time read user reviews their products personally respond . reason i purchased wahl trimmer because brand familiarity especially because my barber recommended it . my review based extended use replacement trimmer i am more than satisfied it . it less expensive than other brand i purchased it works great	1
my husband leaving more than 20 pairs reading glasses everywhere any where could still never find pair when he needed them .... even ead menu ! these glasses answer anyone who wears reading glasses . i bought them all colors him even bought pair work friend who works him(he loves them well bought more colors also ) . neither them lost pair all these months . they also started so many conversations . everyone who asked them same bought all colors . it takes little adjusting getting use but everyone we know never returned pair . only reason they returned order more colors or order friends loved ones ! these glasses fantastic ! thanks great service	1
i really enjoy my readers . i work health/computer field training among other things not worry carrying case when your arms loaded or misplacing them not able find them when needed . it so convenient just " click " them off when i'm . i asked them almost every where i go nurses work just love them . they very convenient .	1
i love idea glasses always where i find them . only problem they need also adjustable how wide band . every time i look up magnets pop apart . if they fix , i'd give them 5 stars !!	1
i really liked it first . it gave consistent readings clear easy understand . i wouldn't say i rough it all but somehow it broke . tab holds little door closed batteries broke off without any misuse .	-1
its easy use very clear instructions . got it delivered per scheduled time without any kind delay . thanks product	1
i use schick intuition razor . so , when gillette finally came out their version 2 1 razor , i excited try it . i like them both different reasons . intuition lasts longer my opinion cartridges less expensive . however , it bit bulky it difficult reach some areas . gillette breeze makes maneuvering more simplistic due it sleek style . moisture/shaving strips ran out after one shave . rate , it could become quite expensive replace blade . so - choice yours . which one fits your lifestyle best ? both products good 2 1 product makes my shaving experience bit more pleasurable less time consuming	1
i didn't personally use this but i bought it my mother who broken more expensive one . she said it worked perfect if not better than other one . she loved large display information it could hold 1 or 2 individual multiple readings . she especially likes all around automatic use . just touch one button machine inflate you . not complicated all . price excellent only $29.99 . i priced one wal-mart all auto-inflate digital blood pressure monitor cheapest they started $45 . very good buy amazon if i say so , well my mother	1
pros : handle weighted well . very close shave . less irritation than previous generations , even against grain . extra blade back = worth it . cons : 5 blades get gunked up quickly , requiring more passes . long surface area ( blade ) takes some getting used . expensive ; not compatible mach3 system . update :d own 2-3 stars . used razor two weeks found it not function well mach3 . if you not everyday shaver ( sometimes i don't shave weekends or holiday breaks ) you suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth growth . also , i found i simply wasn't getting close shave i mach3 , even when shaving every day . i agree there less irritation , but only slightly so . i miss sideburn blade heft handle , but i'm happy i returned it purchased more blades my mach 3 power instead -- me , least , this wasn't improvement	1
nothing special report . toasty , no annoying auto-shutoff , cord plenty long	1
works advertised , except water phoenix so hard , i only get 3 uses instead 10 out cartridge . absolutely zero need towel dry car .	1
i like hot brush , i short hair which i blow dry use brush finish top . it quick , compact lets me finish quickly .	1
there no choice color shaver screen trim . one i replaced black ... new one i got amazon gray . it would nice know what color i getting , but not shown or selectable . other than cutter foil flawless , like all braun shaving products	1
this great product ! i first used this mirror my sister-in-laws house wrote down product number ... then went web . found amazon ! great those us over 50 yrs . old ! now i actually see put my makeup find my contacts when i lose one my eye ! my sisteen year old granddaughter loves well . i bought one her mother she " stole " it immediately telling her mom she needed it more ! we all love 5x mirror !	1
excellent precise trimmer , i even use it trimming sideburns . it , simply , best i ever owned .	1
my last set remington curlers , very similar this set , lasted over 10 years i very happy see they still made comparable model . curlers heat up quickly great job curling your hair . 2 different size curlers great different hair styles . i prefer original metal clips came my first set plastics ones this one not fit if you long hair . overall i would recommend this set someone shoulder length or short hair .	1
i've owned these curlers before . i tried some others before finding these amazon they didn't compare . you leave them 60 seconds or 5 minutes depending type curl you want . either way they always work great	1
it not worth $1.00 . you get better shave spoon . it no rpm . speed slow even when fully charged over 8 hours . blades not cut even little stubble . light no meaning , it tells you nothing battery supply or if it needs charged or running low . cord too short . good - battery last time , but how you tell .	-1
jut time i found best friend i look . amazing , friendly , powerful , excellent , brilliant , magnificent . i use it all time leave my face radiant . since i met this friend , i don't want continue any more friendship gillete razor . gillete razor my friend years , but norelco my princess now . wonderful !!! leave my face clean radiant . my motto : " clean face , happy face .	1
it good gift friends . i bought one my friend birthday gift , she likes it very much	1
once every two years i feel moved write positive review . this shaver incredible . i used high end norelcos years they what ford taurus too mercedes class ( panasonic ) . this real deal , some silly toy oozing gels nagging cleaning reminders . i noticed some reviewers still say they occasionally go back blade close shaves . i cannot imagine why . i run cleaning cycle every day no twin blade compare thorough 5 min shave this bad boy ( never used 3-4 blades ) . others mentioned , this shaver far less expensive other sites , but this good place review	1
it not often people take time write review something like electric shaver , but , this product truely deserves recognition . here what i found . i really tested them all ! i am very particular spending my hard earned something seems cheap or looks like it only cost $5 make overseas . so i generally tend gravitate higher/highest end product lines . i tested owned following:norelco newest speed xl 9170xlccnorelco spectra 8 james bond seriesnorelco cool shave nivea lotion dispenser built ( don't even bother!)braun 360 #8995 , made germany-their best model panasonic es8228 vortex nano triple blade hydrasystem ii - brookstone exclusive model but same es8168si tested all these over course 2 years . they all perform cleaning functions cleaning unit , or they rinsed under faucet . here resultsnorelco'snorelco newest speed xl triple blade system absolutely no better than spectra 8 ( james bond series ) or above . it may actually worse because smaller cutter sizes . it however provide comfortable shave norelco most known . it easy , smooth quiet . anyone use this shaver not get nicked . it pleasure hold almost makes you move circles which seems attack hair any angle . good - it just not shave close braun or panasonic . physics dictate , metal ringcups hold round blades just thick pull hair up clip hair below surface claimed . cleaning system huge not " intelligent " like braun . overall proven solid performer . braun 360 #8995this unit much better pivoting head design than past models very unique foil supposed grab hairs more effeciently - well , it definately provides closer shaver than previous models . this shaver however work . get really close shave you need follow their directions stretching pulling your skin tight . most guys this somewhat anyway , but really get close shave this unit expect work it , expect go over same area different directions . " bar " shaver just designed way , you provide attack path your beard . not bad things but certainly more work . expect get your closest shave after around 5 minutes leas t.t he braun loudest shaver bunch , fact annoying those house . motor truley slower than panasonic it shows . it clunky unit hold comparison norelco , panasonic . but , it definately shave closer than any norelco date . cleaning unit big bulky loud but very good job . replacement cleaner tanks way overpriced compared others . panasonic vortex nano system . i happen bought mine brookstone , yes i paid $50 premium their special color ( light beige/silver ) wood grain finger rests backlight lcd . it also smallest cleaning unit matches color shaver attractive . this keeps my wife happy since it not lot clutter , these cleaning units need stay put . true test closer shave amoungst unitsthere really only one way test units - shave 1/2 your face one unit , other 1/2 different shaver . i this many weeks . almost any shaver going feel pretty smooth after you first shave , you'll quickly notice which side closer end day or next morning . great test - i this too ! shave your face one brand , then immediately shave your face again unit . i absolutely guarantee these panasonic vortex nano shave you even closer after shave . you notice this " sound " your beard cut . it absolutely amazing !!! design engineering wins panasonicthree technologies seem completely advanced panasonic compared anyone else . they motor speed , 30 degree blade angle nano blade sharpening . here my results : 1 . fastest linear motor 13,000 rpm patented , it makes big difference . 2 . super quiet compared braun same norelco3 . entire head goes out pivots left right . this great because you push harder without fear ruining cutter foil or nicking yourself . 4 . cutter head slightly " curved " which makes big differnce when moving circular attack . 5 . no vibration incredibly speed , comfortable hold6 . cleaning unit small fast efficient . uses water much larger tank than anyone else cleaning detergent cartridge that lot less money than anyones . hey , anyone sell you alchohol cartridge , this much smarter , cleaner , more economical . 7 . while road , you clean unit simply pumping ordinary liquid soap onto head while it running , let it suds up , then rinse off let dry . how cool ! 8 . yes , it used shower if you want . these units well sealed well madewell , i hope helps you save time money . you could easily get this same unit amazon under different model just make sure it following : 1 . nano blade technology - much sharper polishing system their blades2 . vortex ( convex blades foil)3 . hydaclean system iimake shaving fun again , go buy one .	1
it nice . small strong . my father used this one 4 months .	1
it get tension stress out your muscles . worth just try it	1
size makes it easy directly pinpoint secific areas massage heat option die . only downside manual it says not use it more than 15 minutes continuously so motor doesnt overheat it numbs your hand after you use it strongest vibration setting . overall its great purchase someone occasional sore muscle exercise .	1
i bought this iron after reading some negative reviews here . i love it . i non problems others say they . my hair perfectly smooth after using it , which hard my thick , curly hair . i even friends try it they agree it awesome . it pricey , but worth it if you hard straghten hair	1
i fence spending money this iron i am glad i . i still dry my hair almost all way but i don't worry styling brush . iron might add minimal amount time getting ready but my hair never looked better . my hair wavy i driven my friends family crazy over years complaining how hard it style . i used curling irons flat irons straighten my hair -spent more time ok results . this product i love my hair . it looks straight but still body -like i paid professional my hair . your hair get caught plates if you too quick/careless but i think any iron	1
i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	1
whenever i am out i my glasses around my neck . funny thing when i go put them i pull them apart . this makes everyone jump ! thinking i just broke my glasses lol too funny . then when they see how they work they all want pair . i know i could spokes person this company . excellent product very well made i mine years no complaints ever	1
little bigger bulkier wider band than i expected but still comfortable effective . i seem sleep better when i use it .	1
this great , everyday shampoo . i fine hair i find it leaves it soft shiny , without weighing it down . it got great scent . i would definitely recommend this product . it worth it	1
job 50 bucks its great deal	1
i back/shoulder pain recently ordered this product two weeks ago . i really love it because it works great me . after couple runs rolling/kneading ( well , they call it shiatsu ) perfect pressure , my back feel relieved . cons : it too short reach my upper shoulder . suggest homedics redesign it , maybe hood shape allows massager roll upper shoulder lower back .	1
this shaver my first shaver i got it when i 15 . i really like it because it gives me close shave doesn't irritate my skin hardly all . trimmer side almost useles , but rest system outstanding . it doesn't take long charge hold charge long time . it great option anyone buy i highly recomend it	1
while i am far expert nutritional suppliments , this one seems work advertised ( although , all i know , it could also simply placebo effect ! )	1
i feel guilty just drinking this stuff . i got cookie cream i mixed it soy milk man , tastes like real thing , even cookie clumps . i actually enjoy drinking this shake before after my workout which weird first because it tastes sooo good !! only using it few days so i can't comment results just yet . i just post how this best tasting protein shake i ever tasted ! i strawberry milkshake way too . if you amazon prime , free 2-day shipping + no tax = can't beat price anywhere else . ordered wed morning got it thursday afternoon !	1
i always track my reps weight i lift , since taking muscle milk i've consistently outperformed my plateaus . i've great gains , i lift more , taste awesome ! i highly recommend it i'll definitely buying more	1
my friend used this razor two months he loves it . he enjoys smooth quiet close shave , loves trimmer , design . his only small complaint shave little slow his ultimate dream . however , he hyper type personality so i'm not sure razor slow since he everything super sonically . thanks norelco ! you made me look good	1
i've always wary electric razors , but i say this one works pretty well me . it took no time my face get " used " this razor ( past it hell try get through couple weeks other kinds ) . first day i used it i got nice , close shave no irritation . single charge lasts me couple weeks , so even though i've brought charger me when traveling i've never use it ( i'll leaving it home next time ) . i haven't actually used cleaning system yet , because you run entire razor under hot water clean it out no problem . i just leave it counter dry until i come home work . my only complaint would like most other people ( all other electric razors i know ) it doesn't get all those hard get hairs my neck without several passes , trimmer doesn't get close enough my sideburns . not problem though , i just keep disposable razor shower touch up --- just few seconds no lather so not big deal . i would recommend this product anyone looking make switch	1
unlike other reviewer , i love taste vanilla . but then , i mix it orange juice so it tastes like orange julius	1
i recently plesantly surprised get bottle light blue gift it totally made my day because i down last 1/5 my last summer bottle sooner i would bought new one anyway . this how much i love this perfume . talking mind reading ! thank you , dg , creating this refreshing masterpiece	1

perfectly honest this make my hair grow alot . im not really surprised because it contains alot amino acids which help hair growth naturally anyway . after month using it everyone i mean everyone saw difference length my hair . only advice i would give not take many pills it says take . they say bottle take like 3 pills day each bottle . which really my opinion not healthy so i only took 1 pill day each bottle- aminos , herbal other bottle . i took it like 3 weeks straight my hair shiny , long strong . when you take one pill day each bottle instead 3 not only it healthier but pills last longer lol . but it good investment	1
i chose this shaver after reading number owner reviews . after using it few weeks , i find it well deserving glowing comments those reviews , it far exceeds claims marketers . well , braun .	1
fast shipping , they kept me updated shipping status , product exactly described , excellent price , i`m very satisfied this purchase . keep up this excellent service guys !!!	1
i bought this toothbrush because it gold box savings needed replace my other oral . i am so happy it . my teeth feel " squeaky clean " after using it it doesn't " tickle " my gums like sonicare . it great battery life two different speeds . after few weeks , my teeth look whiter i lot less plaque my last dental appointment . my husband dentist started use more deluxe , but similar , version this ( digital timer , 4 speeds , some other aesthetic nuances ) also very pleased . fact , he likes it so much he starting give them away his new patients !	1
this unit great ! it well made , takes up minimal space , it gives me peace mind my toothbrush clean ! i also keep dental pick tongue scraper there well . i imagine my toothbrush getting tan everyday ... only thing i found , it it not fit sonicare head there . but it 3 small toothbrush holders one larger hole like wider handled tongue scraper etc ... i love it ! no bacteria hanging out my toothbrushes	1
i like way this cream gives instant glow noticed difference next morning too . mine dry sensitive skin cream works well . very nice smell	1

i using these flosser piks few years . waterpik flosser recommended my dentist because my teeth very close together traditional flossing takes lot time . waterpik flossers i'm able floss very quickly mornings . my teeth cleaning experiences much , much better now i use flossers .	1
i skeptical buying this first , but after seeing it allure , reading various reviews amazon , i decided try it . i say , i pleasantly surprised ; it what it says . it won't work cyctic acne or if pimple already come head . it work pimples just beginning .. those hard , tender knots deep under your skin you just know going huge day or two . i've used it two pimples red bumps , both mostly gone within 24 hours . completely gone less than 3 days . usually it would taken 7-10 days them go away , it would ugly	1
ok , let me preface this saying i am one biggest skeptics you'll ever meet . i don't easily fall new fads , miracle cures , or anything seems too good true . this said , i am completely love this product feel it helped boost my immune system 100% . unfortunately , i am not health-conscious i should . i am overweight , bit addiction mcdonald cheeseburgers , maybe exercise once or twice week . it all seemed catch up me last thanksgiving when i got hit cold . no big deal , i get them couple times year . then , right before christmas , i got cold . i very put-out , but just figured it my bad luck . february rolls around brings it cold #3 . i missed quite bit work getting very concerned something else might wrong . i developed slight fever , but it all went away one week . i hoped it all over i just unfortunate cold season . when i got back work , i spoke one my co-workers , " emily , " who self-proclaimed health-nut . she would always brag she " never got colds . " i would cringe tell her ) not tempt fate ) stop rubbing it . she swore this " green food " powder she drank every day her lemonade . it looked like finely cut grass , i assumed that what it . i told her she nuts , she hadn't gotten cold because she lucky , she ate really well , ran every morning . i let her fix me some powder tried mix it up my tea . it horribly , it felt like i drinking , well , finely cut grass . it didn't bad taste , but texture grotesque . i told her i'd take my chances . well , here comes march , it , new cold . this time i desperate . emily told me go health store look some green foods capsule form . i so , although i couldn't find brand she taking capsule form ( green vibrance ) , i find greens plus . it seemed lot similar ingredients , so i went ahead bought it ($40 ! ) . whatever , i figured this my last-ditch effort before hauling myself down doctor . i took 4 pills night , , i swear , woke up next morning feeling ok . it like i knocked my cold out before it really got started . i elated , but still not convinced . i sure it could coincidental , but after four months four colds , i really didn't care . i took 3 these pills every morning ( you take up 12 ) , colds didn't come back . twice since then , i've felt " scratchy throat " feeling you get when cold coming , i'll up my dosage 4 , twice day . i'm always fine next day . colds flying around my office , but emily i still ( knock wood ) healthy . i've since little internet research individual ingredients , but am still not sure what it helping . maybe it just placebo effect . i haven't any other benefits product claims like increased energy , stamina , etc ., but i also haven't gotten cold . i am faithful believer it now . maybe it just snake oil maybe it all due placebo effect . but seriously , i don't care . i haven't cold while , so i'm happy . i would recommend this product anyone .	1
i purchased these after seeing physician friend mine using them . i absolutely recommend these any active person who needs reading glasses ready . i clip them morning use them off throughout day never misplace them . i purchased these gifts other professional people . one pair i purchased bit narrow temples . i heated back band hair dryer gave them little side side pull , placed them they fit just fine . if you particularly large person this may necessary	1

i dealing w/ pain planters factitious while now . it pain stretch every morning or night , especially w/ full time job 2 children under 3 . however , i leave this thing next my bed stretch first thing am last thing pm it works very well . i first started using it while pt found all other stretches they me , this one seemed like most productive felt most effective .	1
naturally , my hair wavy , very thin strands but piles piles it . my hair somewhat difficult when it comes straightening -- usually it looks fine when i leave house , but comes completely undone after four hours . so , when my last conair straightener broke , i went out invested my money this one . overall , it okay . it straightened my hair one stroke , which rare me . however , it seemed just suck all moisture out my hair , leaving it extremely dry dull ( which definitely not good vegan such myself , since my hair already dry enough ! ) . movements clumsy this , i occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due plates unexpectedly shifting toward me . it didn't break , it still going just strong day i first bought i t.t his straightener problems dealing smaller amounts hair , or fine " baby hairs " around my forehead . sadly , it couldn't keep my side bangs straight save its life -- they wavy ever two hours after i'd straightened it . this straightener most minimal job -- least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies straightener more worthwhile .	-1

this metrx protein powders my favorites , though when amazon this brand stock it less expensive per serving than metrx . metrx foams up bit more seems little thicker ( not negatives , my opinion ); twinlab comes out very smooth when made blender . both brands taste very good , least when made fat free or 1% milk ( or very least half milk half water ) . i won't detail nutritional info because it available product description here , but like metrx i like this protein powder gets almost all its calories protein . some protein powders fair amount fat some lot carbohydrates . those formulas may good competition level bodybuilders who need extremely high caloric intake because they working out so hard , but i don't really want protein shake gives me meal worth carbs fat addition protein . i'd rather get my carbs fat real food	1

wonderful inhalation steamer sinus conditions . i plagued bad chronic sinus conditions past 16 years miserable . four surgeries still problems . countless antibiotics , steroid sprays tablets , etc . daily treatments morning evening mabis use neilmed sinus rinse saline packets finally given me my life back quite productive state again . mabis puts out very necessary copious amounts steam where other steamers i owned failed . key mabis concentrates steam where necessary , into nasal passages via small nasal mask . however , it would improvement if mabis would provide nasal adapter ( such nebulizers have)that directs steam straight into nostrils instead small mask which allows steam affect entire nose area . angled chimney inhaler makes it easier use . however , it too could improved use flexible tube or least little more angle so unit easier use while sitting upright instead hunch over . they should also include more than one misting orifice because saline mixes hard water tend clog very tiny hole mister . mabis supply small cleaning tool ( wire ) ream out clogged orifice . if you significant sinus trouble this unit best thing you find . i used several different devices including kaz ( no longer made ) , vicks ( too little steam not effective , facial type rather than sinus device ) . vicks vaporizer use towel(works but very hot brutal face ) . i used essential oils like cinnamon , clove , thyme , tea tree kaz unit obtained some relief but mabis saline mix really most beneficial . it doesn't cure anything but it sure brings some quality life back . i can't recommend this device enough . it very portable easily packed taken trips . i used it my van inverter recent long trip which very convenient . i also use it my sailboat . it utilizes very small amount water which makes it simple use mobile fashion . it easy clean well . i suffer 24/7 chronic sinus , countless doctors , taken all types meds , multiple surgeries this little machine tiny fraction cost big player my regaining some quality life . neilmed sailine packets convenient work well unit , i use third packet each mabis session . i no interest whatsoever neilmed . it just convenient sailine product i found drugstore it helped , so you should know it . mabis best steamer you ever use , don't waste your $$$ other feeble steamers like i .	1
i steam inhaler some years ago , kaz therasteam . i problems my sinuses , it didn't help much . i spent years , some money , attempting solutions my sinus problem , insufficient success . it getting better over years , but every now then i still wake up after 5 or 6 hours sleep can't fall back asleep unless i inhale steam -- hot shower sometimes works , but it basically means getting up up while , which no help if it less than two hours before time i'm supposed get up anyway . i shopping new humidifier , not finding much , when it occurred me there might better steam inhaler than one i used . i came amazon looked around , decided mabis . i am glad i ! this item definitely job , giving off copious amounts hot wet steam , which perfect remedy my dry burnt-feeling sinuses . you even adjust it kind steam you want ! my only quibble it says instructions operating time 6-9 minutes ; it seems closer around 15 , which ok me . main thing , because this device , i've gotten some sleep i otherwise would missed .	1

i disappointed scale . it needs stored flat , so i can't store it sideways cabinet i intended . lcd screen blocked bowl , angle makes it difficult read . it weigh oz , but not lb oz . therefore , any item weighing more than 1 lb requires you math . order return item i would not reimbursed orgininal shipping i would pay it shipped them . other words costing nearly cost scale itself .	-1
this my first epilator . i love this product . many years i shaving my legs get rid hairs . first it ok but eventually i started getting razor burns i lost smoothness my legs . i totally upset . i trying something different finally i found out good product which completely worth amount i spent . it not so costly . it simply awesome . i love i t.t here no much pain . pain during epilating really very less . anybody bear it . i highly recommend this product	1
epilator what i bought it . it removed hair , painless ( i am long time epilator user , though ) . it so painless , i used only below knees but ventured thighs arms , it worked fine . even tough ones came off after few passes . my first epilator epilady , which fine . it died after 3-4 years , i bought emjoi foreverfree spending over $100 , but it didn't work all . i so discouraged didn't want waste any more money , so fixed my old epilady myself used it 10 years or so . it finally got point it not effective removing hair , so i bought this one . this worth money spent . only thing , which very minor , motor seems bit too loud , head comes off too easily . i can't remember what i make head come off when i didn't mean it , but it didn't come off while removing hair , so i think it ok	1
my wife liked this hair straightener . she tried some her friends expensive once she says she really liked it	1

i actually bought this my dentist lot cheaper . but i found this toothbrush better than my previous one ( sonicare 4800 pro ) . if it wasn't battery dieing , i would still using it . lasted me good 3-4yrs . so i needed new one . wasn't keen new design narrow brush head all since coming larger one older model . after months deliberation , decided go 9800 model . it 2 weeks now since i it . i love bristles this model , their not flat , which really helps getting food out my teeth . which also nice neck thin angled , which i'm able ( finally ) reach back my teeth all around . battery lasts like sonicare says , approx 2 weeks . i'm sure they could used better longer lasting battery . oh well ... i'm happy ! update 1 : i actually got up 3 weeks single charge . that even brushing 2x day full 2 minutes . previous i assumed when i saw yellow light , would only got 1 or 2 brushing out it , but it kept going extra week	1
very unusual fragrance grows you . because it not typical mellow floral or sexy musk fragrances , one hard time identifying it or figuring out what think it . thing not try pigeon-hole fragrance . just enjoy it ! it starts off this very different exotic lush fragrance but then after time mellows out very sexy floral-y smell . ( me anyway ) but it lasts hours . so use sparingly . other reviewer stated , you wear it know . not my favorite fragrance ( hence 4 stars ) but definitely one smells good sets me apart !	1
i bought this my husband just under year ago ( might i add it $35 less back then too , how dare they increase price same older product ? ) he loved it . he used it shave his beard everyday close enough shave make both myself his air force career happy . only problem battery charger not charge battery any longer , obviously he can't use it without battery . charger not even register shaver there anymore it well cared . such shame . i can't find replacement charger , so it looks like it back old three blade disposable razor cream us . i can't afford spend $100 something won't last even year when $4 pack disposables lasts him two months . very dissapointed quality this product . other than , it great razor smooth , clean results almost close regular razor , but there slight difference someone who fast growth and/or coarse beard may shave more often . main advantage it lot quicker used or out shower . but if you want something last longer than 10 months , wary this product .	-1
i bought this shaver march 2006 , = = = $69.00 = = = amazon . i read some reviews decided buy extra packets shaving lotion vs . gel . i agree everyone who stated preference . this my first experience any kind electric shaver , so you may wish take my review small grain sal t.t he shaver itself decent . i find my closest shave still blade razor , but curly hair leading razor burn ingrown hairs . i get reasonably close shave without burn . it miss hairs sometimes but if you go back forth enough you eventually catch it all . note : if you're like me only shave every couple days don't let your hair get too long or shaver won't able pick it up . it best shaving stubble . my one real complaint sturdiness . i've removed one star off rating this . i've dropped it couple times shower , ( after all it wet slippery ) few pieces popped off . everything snapped back together all right , but it feel kind cheaply made	1
pros : effective cleans off easily . cons : may leave dry skin . just use face lotion afterward	1

i'm sure my experience not norm , but its probably not uncommon either . i absolutely hate this stuff . just every eye doctor gives it away , probably because alcon gives it them free . you get what you pay . apparently , quite few people allergic this stuff get stinging or dry eye . i'm definitely one them . if you can't wear contacts long you want , definitely try something different	-1

when i got this razor last christmas , it my first electric razor ( i previously using mach 3 ) . i annoyed my old razor because i devote time getting my face ready before , take time clean my face afterwards , i looking forward razor i could just use . when i started using this razor , i noticed i either didn't get very close shave or i pushed too hard irritated face , even after using large quanity lotion several weeks usage . i discovered , however , using shower changed everything . using no lotion , i able obtain closer shave than my mach 3 no irritation . battery life , i typically get 3 ~ 4 good shaves out it before i recharge it which more than enough me . i yet use gel , but so i can't really vouch it , but my experience , if you use this shower you probably won't need it anyways . overall i would probably give it 4.5 because i don't like using it out shower much , but shave i get shower makes me round up 5 .	1
i'm not using gel - it expensive doesn't worth it . instead i'm using regular shaving gel shaving very good me . i'm usually using it shower	1

i've this razor few months , it gives great , close shave . my only issue product battery life fails live up its promises . it claims 25 minutes cordless shaving , but my personal experience closer half . i don't travel much , so razor usually just stays plugged bathroom , but i am still disappointed philips norelco makes such exaggerated claim its product . despite this , i am quite pleased product whole	1
i've used norelco shavers years i like them . after 4 years my most recent norelco stopped holding charge , so i picked up this one . pros : * it gives great shave ! they've changed heads bit added some holes . whatever it , my shave 30% smoother better than my older norelco less time . * it quiet . i actually conversation my wife while shaving . this wasn't possible my older shaver . * it significanly lighter than my older model . * cleanup really easy . you just flush head hot water once week . once month or so you're supposed take out shaving disks head brush them clean but my guess once quarter would plenty . since cleanup major hassle , this terrific feature . cons : * it takes 8 hours charge . yikes ! eight hours . my old shaver never took over hour . * it hard tell how much charge you left . my older model gas gauge type indicator right front . this one just green light goes when you turn razor . when it runs low juice you'll get flashing red light when you finish shaving . this isn't nearly handy . * shape isn't ergonomic other model probably because water rinsing feature . there little plastic fins stick out handle presumably help you hold when it wet . it doesn't feel very good your hand . * there no case store it . this drawback if you use it travel . * head supposed replaced once year . huh ??? this apparently case all new norelco shavers . these heads aren't cheap , folks . i certainly wouldn't replace one unless i problems shaver -- then i'd probably buy new one . bottom line i'm very pleased this shaver . it job very well it quite inexpensive . i would certainly recommend this model over higher end models if price consideration	1
this best dispenser we used . it attches wall easily , eay fill constructed such way it multiple uses . we purchased smaller ones give gifts-knowing others would like it also .	1
although this marketed dog towel , it appears exactly same size quality their bath towels , just different colour . their regular bath towels come very boring colours , this nice deep red . towel itself , i love them . they absorbent they say , they lightweight ( great traveling ) easy wash , either hand they dry quickly , or washer , where they leave no lint dryer like ordinary towels . i highly recommend them	1
i received this product christmas gift 2006 unfortunately it broke march 2007 . i like it its small size , folding capability , retractable cord , but i really only able use it three months before it just wouldn't turn any more . also , it only comes one attachment straight hair but not curly hair . i like it ok time i it , but since it stopped working completely , i can't give it great review .	-1
this very good hair dryer although bit heavy . retractable cord folding handle real plusses . i take it gym several days week , i no trouble fitting it into my bag . it also seems not dry out my hair but leave it fuller	1
this wondereful product . i hesitant order because price so great but read other reviews decided go it . it worked wonders myself my husband . my husband 215 pounds muscle it really helped him well	1
i so suprised see price amazon offered this . i shopped around lot find this exact massager my dad because it same kind his chiropractor using , amazon price far less than anywhere else . we very pleased this . like some others said heat not great , but amazon special price it cost no more than one without heat , so no harm trying it . definately no other complaints item .	1
when i first started working out i just bought regular gnc brand protein it ok but i really didn't want drink it so i gradually left weightlifting scene behind . now i'm back it i read some reviews decided buy this brand but unfortunately gnc only double chocolate ( not choc fan ) but i bought it anyways . i just use water since i can't tolerate milk well it still taste amazing i don't even like chocolate all much . i shake mine never problem clumping or anything . there other products lot more protein per serving but why down shake taste like [ ... ] once day when you drink this every meal more . order vanilla next since flavor my favorite so hopefully it taste just good . buy amazon , gnc too expensive .	1
i started buying protein shakes back high school one after they tasted disgusting !! you couldn't wait get it down pain actually any stuff hit your tastebuds ... uggh ! so i looked online found out optimum nutrition supposedly makes good tasting whey protein powders . well they aren't just good , they're actually grrreeaat ! this only type protein i've bought since then . chocolate best flavor they expanded it mint chocolate , double rich chocolate , chocolate shake , creamy chocolate , now " extreme " chocolate . basically , if you buy chocolate flavored optimum nutrition shake , you're getting best tasting protein out there price , hands down .	1
24g protein per scoop thats not counting milk . i it over 2 months i haven't gotten tired taste ; fact , its pretty damn good . there no need add anything it make it taste tolerable , it really taste great . i use vanilla soy milk couple ice cubes mix it blender . perfect every time	1

this perfect scale weighing pinewood derby cars .	1
norelco 7745x works advertised ... i've only it few weeks though . cleaning easy it shaves close . colors little bit loud .	1
i bought this shaver my boyfriend christmas this year , i really nervous because he never used electric shaver i really wanted him like it , even though i bought one mid-price range . i thought this would perfect because he shaves shower , i didn't realize most shavers aren't use out shower . he used it four times , even though manual says it takes around 3 weeks your face adjust , so far it wonderful . he fairly corse , stubbly black hair needs shaved often , but this razor , his face feels just smooth i'm used . he says it doesn't get quite close if he shave up down razor , but it not huge difference , we won't returning it . i think it definitely worth price i paid amazon , i hope it becomes available again so other people opportunity try it .	1
wow ! thats all i say . former braun 360 user , i assure you this razor works better than braun foil shaver . very impressive results . it close mach 3 if you only shave grain when you us mach . if you save against grain , this might not good enough you	1
excellent quality product very durable . only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 .. what up case they give you tweezers ? way too small tweezers barely fit there	1
wahl medalist fantastic clippers black men , bald men bald black men or almost bald men who want stay clean . used everyday close clean shave . i get no or very few ingrown hairs . great price usually $10 $16 . but clippers hard find . same place sold me my first pair hasn't sold clippers since	1
i've purchased other products interactive health , including ijoy ( which amazing compared other massage chairs i've tried ) , their ottoman 2.0 ( which hits spot calves wonderfully ) . i bought this hopes get same quality effect i their other products , but disappointed . two massaging handles either side pillow massage sides my neck well , but doesn't hit back my neck all -- that where my sore spot always tends ! " pillow " itself hard uncomfortable , so you position your head carefully order really relax . i wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager its expensive price . however , should you find this massager sale , it decent product . i'm still pursuit more effective neck massager , though ..	-1

my other ( brand ) hot hair brush ' comb style ' type ; this my first ' brush style ' . my preference harder comb style over brush style . it seems hair type , thickness , etc . would certainly play big factor - my hair thick course . this brush style works ... it smooths hair , adds volume , curl ; it just takes bit more effort ' hold hair ' or get ' through hair ' because brush bristles not strong enough go through thick hair . this very good choice , i am not disappointed this product . if you thick or course hair , understand you should use smaller sections styling ; ' lift ' - just holding curling brush under hair close scalp works pretty good ... bad side ... if you don't pay attention , your hair get caught removeable brush handle	1

my wife i bought this chopper love it ! we frustrated electric choppers because they tended turn everything into mush . this chopper creates perfectly sized cuts ( especially our favorite - quesadillas ! ) handle large size pieces . example , i use this onions , but also bell peppers . you approx . quarter chop bell pepper place it ( unseeded ) press - then give it definitive push walah ! i not suggest putting half-onion ( shown picture ) , cutting food surface fairly flat makes big difference . i recommend using it flat surface , it require little extra push ( hence " bubble " top " press here " type button ) . we not experienced any trouble it breaking or too difficult ( we've it 1 year ) - although we lose cleaning piece , so it takes little more effort clean now . ( hope this helps ! ) my husband says , " it what its suppose ... saves time ... it works . " you push end chopper not middle	1

i bought few boxes these odwalla bars january 2007 approximately = = = $22.00 /box = = = during amazon special $10 off promotion . price two boxes these bars came out $35.00 after discount . price one these bars retail stores almost -never- dips below $1.50 bar . so 48 bars , you'd paying $72.00 plus tax . you see , if you know you like these bars plan eat lot them , now time stock up . especially free shipping . product , bars themselves excellent . i eat these daily work where i'm too busy make myself breakfast , i find it takes edge off perfectly until i'm ready lunch . i'm especially fan berriesgomega choc . chip peanut flavors . they both delicious flavor , good texture , much healthier ( not mention mostly organic ) than many other so called " health " bars out there ( hooah ! etc ) , taste far better than anything else i've tried . bonus , these bars shipped out quickly ; i received them within 5 business days my order . 5 stars	1
sleeping memory foam like no other experience . it soft but not like cotton padding . it really conform your body limbs . i notice chemical smell which went away first day . no biggy . it slip off my mattress easily . if i fix it , it slips again same night ( not completely , just 6 " ) . i didn't get quilted cover which may prevent happening . animal hair sticks memory foam like glue so keep it covered . free pillow very small not useful sleeping . kids could use it but i use it while watching tv - very comfy . i bought memory foam topper because i condition called costocondritis ( inflamation muscles ribs ) . my ribcage terrible pain night when i'm trying sleep . i found i fine when i sleep something soft so i thought memory foam would help . it really hasn't i think it because when i'm laying it my weight flattens it my surface area becomes hard my mattress . i am 100lbs overweight so i think that why . i think i just buy softer mattress use this one my hide-a-bed my guests ( oh , lose weight ! ) . still , i don't regret buying it . bottom line , if you heavy like me , topper flatten you won't experience memory foam softness except your limbs . maybe thicker one would work better . buy cover because it " scoot " off your mattress cover protect it animal hair . my children think it feels like cloud lay i recommend it average weight person	1
think carefully before purchasing this item . it so very soft , but chiropractors tell you softness not what needed people who suffer lower back problems . you sink so deeply into this thing , it like sleeping candy floss . after i started using it , every day i would wake up sore lower back , which i thought must related something else . finally , expaseration i removed mattress topper reverted my old , firm ikea mattress . back pain gone immediately . this foam topper really doesn't provide enough support - it ' cradles ' you , indeed , but it healthier your spine sleep firmest surface you find comfortable . there no point sending it back refund - time they deduct ( exorbitant ) shipping fees , 20% ' service fee ' , shipping you pay return , you'll nothing left .	-1

if you extreme pain your neck , shoulders , upper back , this excellent product . i degenerative cervical disc disease ms so this product helps ease pain throughout day but expecially morning . forget rectangular pads $20 , this worth every penny . my generates more heat typical low , med , high selections most heating pads . moist heat ability go up 166 degrees . though it dry heat option i can't imagine ever using it because moist heat really penetrates below surface bring you relief . my only complaint cord should extend front flaps not back one . it little annoying but overall worth small inconvenience every penny i paid it	1

reviewer wachsmuth krogmann thomas tank engine , clear little plastic piece designed light up tank fell into tank after third time we filled it . then water leaked everywhere , including onto electronics . apparently plastic simply glued into tank even slightest touch it falls back inside . when you place tank back onto thomas this piece fits over other clear plastic piece houses actual bulb light . this apparently enough cause piece loosen fall into tank . there no way fix this or any warning not touch it . course normal filling its almost guaranteed you touch this some time . i dont know you , but mixing toddlers , water electricity recipe disaster !! children should never allowed anywhere near this product !! this major defect safety hazard !!!! product should recalled !!!	-1
this " cane " great . if you want relieve pressure your back ( or anywhere , really ) this it ! i love it take it me everywhere i go . i highly recommend this	1
i love thera cane ! i've muscle-related back problems over 10 yrs . however , last 2 yrs really bad . i've chiropractor , massage , acupuncture nothing stuck - plus i got tired spending all money them . first time i used thera cane i almost cried !! within 20 minutes i completely pain free . it such long time since i could move around w/o pain . although pain came back , each session it gets less pain-free time gets longer . i believe i've broken cycle . i just used it morning before work , then after work then before bed . if your pain muscle-related , thera cane well worth it !	1
i looking dryer use after swimming came across this one . i already own panasonic ionic dryer so i looking something preferrably smaller carry locker room use after swimming . size this dryer just right my bag . arm bendable so not take up more space lengthwise . i like this dryer because it ionic it dries my hair up really fast after washing my hair . my hair pretty silky afterward too . this overall good travel size dryer . only complaint i switch .. sometimes it rather difficult switch it off after drying my hair . dryer seasaw-like switch off middle , low setting above high setting below . therefore , too much pressure put switch push switch either above or below not middle which switch it off . otherwise , good buy	1
great second one so good i bought spare case this model taken out production	1
we've using these garbage bags year now they mostly live up claim their strength . we went using cheapest kitchen size garbage bags these after getting deal them local grocery store . cheap bags , i would frequently problems bag ripping when removing trash or fear bottom would fall out bag when filled lots heavy items . i not any these problems these bags . i packed these bags maxiumum capacity no problems . my one complaint area around very top bag susceptible damage , particularly tie top . when i am tying up full bag , oftetimes orange tie built into bag begin rip through bag . this not caused any major issues so far so i don't think it big deal . also , area around top bag weaker plastic lacks flexibility rest bag , so if you removing overfilled bag trashcan , you must use some care . overall these great garbage bags i highly recommend them .	1
positive side , i liked design this groomer well nice storage box . i not experience any problem attaching/removing attachments , like other reviewers . terms actually using this groomer trimming , i'm quite disappointed . i bought this trimmer hoping trim my beard very short . it seems spacers not meant used short beard , since they not trim it . other hand , using trimmer without any spacer , almost shaves my beard completely not what i want . major drawback this groomer battery drains too quickly . more importantly , when battery empty , even if groomer attached wall socket it not bypass battery but rather tries recharge it again which course hopeless when using trimmer	-1
i bought this my husband because he likes keep his facial hair trimmed i found this product . price very reasonable , if you let it charge overnight it keeps it charge long enough perform whatever function you need it . i surprised see other customers who dissatisfied product . my husband loves it i am buying one my grown son his birthday	1

i tried 5-6 hair trimmers , mostly nose hair . they all worthless -- until i found micro trimmer . this little puppy works perfectly . i given up finding good trimmer pulling nose hairs out tweezers . periodically , i would get infection sometimnes lasted over week very painful . i read it also dangerous . micro trimmer takes just few seconds it great job . it ok eyebrows other places , but standard clippers or scissors work better there . only downside it cheaply made . it falls apart it gets stuck . falling apart nuisance . when it gets stuck , i stick razor blade or fingernail teeth move blade slightly . this usually frees it . if not , replace battery . i own 4-5 so i one home , office , car , spares . they cheap they work . i would normally rate something made this poorly 1 or 2 , but sucker works so well i give it 4 .	1
this great conditioner . i super fine hair , after using this , shampoo , i find my hair super soft , shiny not all weighed down . it also great , clean smell , which i love . i would definitely recommend it	1

maybe i high pain tolerance , b/c i didn't find this product painful . it works very well-if hair missed , i just go back over it . much more effective , time saving , less messy than waxing . i've only used it twice but my hair already growing much sparser . i like fact it rechargable , so you more flexibility . i would definitely recommend it , but it seems it really painful some people . however , i think you might get used it over time . i guess if you tolerate waxing , then this might same terms pain factor . maybe pulling your skin very taut might help	1
i ordered source life because i wanted try liquid instead deal so many bottles different vitmains minerals . i dont ' swallow so many pills ... just one cap full liquid ! this simple it tastes great . i don't anything negative say this product except it advertise 32 0z . bottle . my bottle 30 oz . size . but compared other places this best price source life . i tell difference energy level . it good product	1

i use this insurance policy keep my face getting oily , so i can't say exactly how well this works active acne , but chemically this seems equivalent anything else 2% salicylic acid . added twist it contains ' microbeads gently burst contact when massaged into skin ' . what this means it feels like you're rubbing your face soapy grit - which sounds bad , but it good thing . you feel little granules digging into your pores abrading dead skin even when you're just using your hands wash . so i prefer it neutrogena oil free acne wash reason . it also takes just tiny dab palm one hand lather up your face very well , so one tube lasts quite while , bottom dispensing tube very convenient . however , wide flat bottom design means when you no longer squeeze anything out there still quite bit left there . point you need take some scissors just cut top off you'll extra two weeks or so soap !	1

i bought 2 these pillow , one my husband one myself , back college . i would recommend this pillow anyone everyone . its amazing product works just described . we used ours every night over year never dissapointed . there few downsides noted other reviews , but nothing makes it bad product . negatives : core material get bunched up but it easily re-adjusted flattened out . if you vaccume seal it correctly it doesn't get bunched easily . very heavy slides around inside pillow case . requires weekly maintenance keep it good condition . but if you take care your chillow it take care you . positives : after well over year still worked like day we got it . never lost its cool so speak ! chillow my best friend while fighting migraine ! ( which 4 times week)i slept better than i ever my life . note i want point out common mis-conception noted some reviews . chillow get warmer night progresses , however it intentional . our body falls sleep faster cooler temperatures , but middle night when we rem sleep , cold make us restless disturb our sleep . chillow designed become warmer provide more restfull sleep during our critical rem sleep cycles . this very important part what chillow all ! great sleep ! after more than year , i want note both our chillows sprung leaks , thrown out . leaking wasn't enough soak our pillows , but water them so long it slight odor it wasn't pleasant sleep . i am here buying 2 more new chillows , they worth every penny . i am more than happy support soothsoft purchasing replacements great product made my hectic life more bareable !	1

i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	1

if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

( salon waxing / lazor tx/ etc . / too expensive . ) finally : i acheived desired results ; legs silky smooth touch lay eyes , using braun epilator ( plucks hairs out root using 12 rotating " tweezers " ) followed conair hair removal system ( i call it polisher ) . braun epilator removes all hairs long enough tweezed , leaving behind ingrown hairs some micro-hairs , hairs too short tweezed . conair system uncovers all ingrown hairs , removes most hairs uncovered micro hairs . after using braun epilator , conair system , moisturizer , my legs feel silky smooth . smoothness lasts days , not hours . wonderful ! only downside : i use one polishing disk per leg , each time i exfoliate . i wish disks would last longer . bottom line ; my legs appear smoother feel silky longer than they w/ shaving , so overall , i'm delighted	1

just ordered , so i can't comment amazon shipping it , but i used it my miele front loading washer very successfully . one major caveat , though : i use * way * less detergent than scoop suggests - half lowest mark scoop plenty . more than suds remain . perhaps if you pets or kids who play mud lot you need higher amounts , but my " normal " wash sure doesn't warrant it fact seems work better lower amounts .

i admit it , i got this because it cheap ! i thick , wavy hair which needs straightend because i use very very good set ceramic straighteners , hair dryer didn't matter much . however , first time i used it i shocked how straight silky my hair felt ! combined straighteners my hair looks awesome ! i noticed some people commenting dryer cutting out after week or so . this happened me too i too thought it bust . however , i checked plug it one those needs tested before applicance works - you know little red button plug safety ? it not just cut out plug but one needs doing each time it took few minutes figure it out because england ( where i am ) we don't these much . all i now press white button before i plug it it works charm . three heat settings ioniser settings great - it really makes difference when ioniser - not gimick all i suspected ( like i said , i got it because it cheap ! ) . it well worth money great buy ! if you thick hair which hard keep tamed , this really helps before rest regime	1

we used this humidifier our baby room two months now . it great job quietly keep room humid . now because winter not really started east coast here yet . if heater not kick , room would feel cold due humidity . problem this product only knob control output , but seems lacking feedback loop . therefore if it comes thermostat , i would say it perfect . but considering price , i let it go . it pretty easy maintain compared other traditional warm mist ( mineral buildup heating device ) or cool mist ( filter change accompanied loud fan noise ) humidifiers . however , you shouldn't forget occasional cleanings mildew under cap , under tank , base	1

i previously tried waterpik other rain fall like showerhead waterpik cf-201 . it horrible , arm wouldn't hold its place one i recieved this horrible leaking problem probably due its largely plastic construction . low expectations waterpik brand , i stumbled upon this gem . jp-130 looked lot sturdier than their other model . upon recieving it , my initial impressions true , fantastic ! chromed metal gave it distinguishably elegant look no plastic showerhead give . swing arm actually , when adjusted properly actually stays where you want it ! spray pattern very soothing gentle stream . it doesn't pack lot pressurized punch like some other heads . but i wasn't looking . my only gripes if i point out any would need possible longer swing arm . 9 " arm more than suitable most people . but i'm 6'1 " it'd nice little more range . i definitely couldn't imagine deal shorter swing arm . next , it not really problem , but i hope waterpik eventually makes newer model even wider head . 60 nozzles pretty good job covering my entire body if i stand still , but moving around little puts parts my body out stream . extra 1 " or 2 " would nice , extra 3-4 " diameter would superb ! regardless other reviews , i didn't find adjusting knobs hard other reviewers made it out , maybe it just me ? after reading what others said , i expected give each knob my " death grip , " but they didn't need it . overall , you simply can't beat this showerhead money . i'm sure it even better than more expensive showerheads . something people use multiple times day , 7 days week , it money well spent !!	1

i've using sumo tech years , far i'm concerned it best sculpting product out there . great creating shape texture - it light enough my fine , thin , straight hair . it doesn't greasy shine comes most pomades , but you mix little bb brilliantine or styling wax if you want little more gloss . little bit sumo tech goes long way - just put little water your hand if it dries out while styling instead using more . you also touch up your hairstyle during day using damp fingertips	1

i so sick shaving . irritation shaving cream , dry skin , rashes . this product revolution you get close shaving feel without hassles . must buy everyone who shaves	1
i spend alot money getting brazilian waxes . last couple times i must got timing all wrong because within week hair started sprouting up . i can't tell you how annoying , so i decided purchase emjoi epilator . i say this thing fabulous ! since i am used waxing " danger zone " me there no pain . fact it more comfortable than waxed . i also used it my legs , upper lip underarms . it great job everywhere . i highly recommend this product your hair removal needs , it paid itself one use . money i save i buy shoes	1
this second epilator i've owned it doesn't hurt/sting much when it used prior model . i couple places it scraped skin , so you somewhat careful use it properly . all all i'm very happy it	1
it crazy how people come up this stuff . these tooth tunes tooth brushes really facinating actually . song plays your mouth whole 2 minutes so you're brushing your teeth dentist suggested time . parents love it too , if you don't want sit watch your children brush their teeth , but make sure they're brushing them long enough , get them this ! they choose bunch different songs artists . it'll music your ears , teeth !	1
i don't drink often so when i it hard know my limits . this thing really helps . however i found you really wait while after your last drink before it get good reading . once i blew . 04 then 5 minutes later i blew . 09 !! i trust this thing works though . it warn you you should wait 20 minutes after your last drink . i would wait longer though . it worth money me . you should send it calibrated every 6 months though	1
you've probably bought these your local supermarket , so you know what you're getting -an alternative unhealthy snacks . i eat them tasty meal replacement bar , too . cost savings significant buying them through amazon . once we run through box i brought work , i'll buy again .	1
i think this one my favorite razor blades because it gets close enough your skin where it actually shaves . i also think it doesn't cut me often either	1
i can't around any kind perfume , cologne or other smells without breaking out into some sort rash or allergic reaction . if you allergic soaps other chemicals , this product still leave your clothes feeling soft without all strong smells	1
i considering replacing my mattress , but i thought i'd give this product try first . it very simple use i instant results . i've actually overinflated it bit when i sleep my stomach my back nearly flat . no more back problems ! i wake up feeling good change . i'm so happy i bought this , i've recommended it quite few people . give it try before getting new mattress	1
product perfect use daily cleanser or intensive mask . i've used it month my face neat oil free . although , i recommend not exceed 3-4 mins when using mask , since i experienced excessive drying afterwards .	1
i love this shaver -- finally there decent women shaver !. cleaning system works well . only drawback difficulty finding replacement cleaning solution -- i just pay $8 ship stuff ! i think i'll formulating my own next time	1
it apparent upon immediate receipt this pillow not typical king-sized pillow only two inches larger than standard memory foam contour pillow i already own . noted other comment , odor extremely strong . though i not owned this pillow very long , i made numerous attempts " air out " this pillow , odor remains very strong . addition , this firmest memory foam pillow i ever experienced . i'm hoping time it soften , because it certainly not used sleeping its current state .	-1

... until motor went out one i using 2 years . i thought ' ionic ' thing mostly hype , but started using this product couple years ago out curiosity . my entire life , i naturally curly , flyaway hair annoyingly prone frizzing just generally difficult manage . i wasn't sure if it this dryer finally started smoothing out my hair , or if it rather newer conditioners styling cremes i found . when ionic brush dryer i using recently ' died ' , i unable find replacement any local stores . so , instead , i bought one looked exactly same wasn't ionic , thinking it really wouldn't make any difference . boy , i wrong !!! immediately , i again dealing split ends , frizzies , flyaway hair . there something ' ionic ' hairdryers really make difference , i changed nothing else . scientific person i am , i repeated this unplanned ' experiment ' least 3 times . when i use this product , my hair noticeably silkier , shinier , bouncier ... healthy waves hold ( i somewhat thick hair . ) round brush/dryer style also dries my hair much quicker than way i used it years ( round brushes typical pistol-style dryers ) , much less arm-fatigue . heated air dries it ' inside out ' which styles it same time , eliminating my previous need use curling iron or hot rollers create soft waves/curls after drying . i plan keep spare one hand next time one dies me suddenly . ( i feel like 2 years good life , considering use it got . ) i highly recommend this hair dryer if you hair like mine	1

my advice , get this scale . it dead accurate , last you forever . it exact same scale doctors use , very good price . i never buy any electronic scale again	1
this excellent product . packaging very good . it came two pieces . assembly minimum , but slightly cumbersome because weight . scale accurate it looks like it made last . reason i gave it only 4 stars height measurement rod felt toocheap breakable . lastly , it should understood this scale not everybody . it either doctor office or large bath or exercise room . i not able find anything comparable value less price .	1
i looking scale gave consistent weights 25 years . i tried healthometer spring scales numerous digital scales supposed weigh you within . 2 pound . hah . i would step scale 4 or 5 times consecutively get 4 or 5 different weights . now i am confident i am weighed within . 25 pouund every time . assembly snap it looks like scale built well enough pass my grand children . if you looking truly accurate scale built like tank buy 402kl your worries over . unfortunately bowl ben jerry show up immediately morning weigh	1

chocoleans work suppress actual hunger ; however , they nothing " i feel like eating " feeling . i use them suppress hunger , then when i still feel like eating , i know it not real hunger but my usual food fixations . it helps me psychologically anyway , interpret my feeding feelings ! also , they work best if you not eat one hour before after taking . ( drinks don't count , doesn't seem affect anything . ) i love taste , can't tell much difference sugar-free regular ones ... sugar-free only 6 calories less . it very dark chocolate , so if you don't like dark you probably won't care	1

amazon not provide additional responses feedback responses so my only recourse refuting this company false claims through product review . i wrote negative feedback january 25 . i notice this company responds very aggressively all negative feedback . they said my feedback it " blatantly untrue " because i said they not permit returns . here their own published statement amazon site regarding returns certain products : * pillows , orthopedic soft goods , supports , braces other non-returnable health care items . maintain our deeply discounted pricing your safety protection , regional health laws hygienic concerns render us unable accept returns all pillows , orthopedic soft goods , braces , supports , hot/cold therapy items , electrodes or any other item comes contact skin once it evident it opened removed its original packing . we accept returns unopened products . now i ask : how could one ever determine usability product like this without opening it ?!! absurd . this company needs seriously review its tone attitude towards its customers . what i wrote true their own statement proves it . furthermore , i left my feedback january 25 they said i " bought this almost two months ago " when fact i ordered it december 16 received it after . they not truthful public posted opposition factual feedback statement . their rude , dishonest aggressive response says all needs said their customer service ! i not like product all , but i really dislike their customer service .	-1

i extremely thick , coarse , very wavy ( almost curly ) hair -- definitely challenge any flat iron . prior this curling/straightening iron , i owned $150 we t-t o-dry t3 tourmaline flat iron ( see my review ) , $50 jilbere flat iron , run-of-the-mill drugstore curling iron . conair good job straightening smoothing my hair t3 or jilbere . once i flat iron it , it stays so nice smooth next day it doesn't even require minor touch up . i actually like conair better , because no matter how careful i , t3 terrible pulling my hair , jilbere , while better , still caught stray hair now then . i never gotten hair snagged conair . i love one less hair appliance/cord one less cord cluttering my counter . i also really like it auto turn off forgetful people like me . it slightly more wieldy than flat iron or curling iron alone , but that almost always case when you get 2-in-1 anything . i think it mainly due account rounded outer shape when straightening . you hold it little farther away your scalp . i can't think how they could've made it easier , though , while still keeping 2-in-1 design . it easy switch back forth curling iron straightener . power light temp control right front , so i tell glance whether it or not . other flat irons , i look plates see light . one small nitpick i wish i could set temp it would default same temp everytime i turn it . it , i turn it up every time . but conair amazing bargain . less than $30 convenience curling iron / straightener one , i am highly impressed . i would happily buy it again twice cost , would not hesitate recommend it anyone .	1
this hands down best hair straightener i've ever used ... extremely curly frizz-prone hair , i've quite few over years . i've using it every other day past several weeks so far seen no damage all my hair . fact , it feels even healthier silkier than before . it doesn't sear my hair all , which problem previous straighteners used . it heats up quickly incredibly easy use . shipping quick hai stik works great ! definitely worth money	1

i've mine several years now i find it very dependable useful . i initially some startup problems i , too , thought might battery or switch related . however i discovered spritz wd40 into cutter blades made this tool very dependable . all hair-cutting clippers shavers , blade lubrication needed . other thing people should know while blades cut rotary direction , only way hairs get into cutter through slots . so this tool cuts way only , so just putting it area leaving it there ineffective ... you insert reinsert get uncut hairs into slots . knowing these two things should give you good experience this tool . " pulling " " tickling " others report also minimized blades lubricated so they cut cleanly rather than jam	1

you need follow instructions before turning this ... including putting cardboard collar before inserting wax . wax pernicious ... it gets everything ... so warned . i've gotten my eyebrows waxed strip mall salon before few times . last session someone i've never it before - results showed she likely hadn't doing it long . $10 pop plus tip , i finally realized i should doing this myself - no more shelling out money language barrier how i want it , etc . it take while wax sufficiently warm up - 30 minutes . instructions lackluster - so they lose star just . i would say 99% instructions legal jargon keep them sued ... like don't use this your privates , etc . pulllease ! no insider tips - they assume you've graduated beauty school don't bother tell you much all . thanks wikipedia , i learned lot waxing felt better using this gizmo . i successfully waxed my armpits - this took 3 separate sessions . i would never salon . i'm one those unfortunate women bumpy armpit skin ... so hairs go every direction shaving means i get cut every single time i shave . one day , when i afford it , i get laser hair removal , but mean time , it pretty easy waxing home armpits , eyebrows sideburns . i've struggled legs .. so much surface area ... you're only supposed apply wax once skin per session , so i like my skin few days off before attempting again , otherwise skin peels . other kits i looked didn't look easy operate , which why i chose this warmer . while it bit scam all their wax cans fit only this warmer , no other brand seems structured fit . so far , i am pleased results- wax really grabs hair when yanking bunch same time , there hardly any discomfort ... nothing like pain monotony plucking each hair tweezers	1

nice fragrance i suppose , major problem it it seems stick whatever you spray it months ( clothing wise furniture wise ) . extremely pungent but not sharp all , again it seems rather persistent smell , characteristic i'm not too fond . within last couple years ralph lauren changed their marketing strategy it seems though they going younger audiences , laid back type , high school young college students opposed adults ... this fragrance no different , fact given price it seems following line thought " . " i'm actually quite surprised this product hasn't come down price recently construction quality undoubtedly make you think it isn't high end fragrance . there no wearing this formal affairs , instead it made everyday use ... some like it , i one got sick it fast ( probably something " persistent " or " pungent " characteristic , this coupled fact polo sport mellow not sharp ) . comparing them i'd say dunhill desire far superior product : both extremely mellow yet i feel dunhill fruitier more complex price , while polo sport more chemical ( man made)-meets-lavender shocking sort way . i suppose again , price this easily overlooked but me i'm not entirely sure i like it much i my youth . if you enjoy " mellow " everyday wear don't mind rather " persistent " characteristic this fragrance , than all means give it try - it sure popular late , more than few people daily outing know what you're wearing ( adults might think , `something cheap ' while younger individuals might find it appealing ) . all reasons i previously mentioned though , i'm going give this 2	-1

i now own three ( two spares ) , purchased few friends well . this headlamp three light settings : red led ( which i use most : great behavioral observations nocturnal animals , preserving your night vision ) , white led , bright krypton bulb . it runs three aaa batteries ( nimh rechargeables work fine ! ) . i've used my headlamp months field work ( i study scorpions , work all night , so this headlamp gotten lot field testing ) . no problems so far . it comparable headlamps sporting goods stores sell four or five times much . while likely not waterproof , this headlamp definitely water-resistant ( ok use rain ) . i love it , may never need headlamp again . though amazon currently sells them " pack 2 " , they packaged individually , each one comes 3 alkaline batteries	1
i very highly pleased these lights when i received them .. leds great long use things like camping fishing spotlight great when you need real bright light anything . i would highly recommend this light anyone	1
you're probably struggling choose clipper because reviews so mixed . my experience anyway . i bought wahl super taper ii mostly because 5-star review " inquisitivetoo " . i couldn't happier this clipper so far . i've cut my son hair once , my hair twice . this clipper truly cut hair like knife through butter . aside excellent blades , overall design impressive . this clipper hefty , delivering substantial hand-feel . different-colored clip-on combs easily selected color , eliminating need read print each one . only negative taper ii not cordless . attached cord quite long however , allowing good mobility your wall outlet wherever you're cutting . i see this clipper offered through multiple vendors here , wide range price points which confusing . i can't see any difference plastic-sealed versions , bought one priced $55.95 ( this date ) sold through hairproducts-com	1

( that unusual me - i'm normally bored product much sooner than ! ) lotion little thick , but goes smoothly ; nice , light scent ; absorbs quickly so i get my other makeup . if i one " wish " item this product , it would pump wouldn't clog quite so easily daily uses ; but that small concern compared how great my skin looks . i'm really pleased this lotion	1

since i bought shower filter save my hair dried out ( it worked wonders , my hair never shinier)and i very hard water - i began worry bathing unfiltered water faucet . i chose this bath water filter because instead hanging over faucet you simply drop it into tub five minutes before getting . this way , water pressure stays strong enough so my bubble bath really bubbles . this filter not refillable since i just trying them out - i didn't want spend extra money refillable one . but i probably go refillable version now since my skin definitely feels softer .	1
i issue mine , it shorted out or something . just got bad one . i going call it replaced , but new baby , just not time . when i posted my review , they contacted me offered replace it ! talk going above beyond . day such poor customer service , this wonderful ! looking forward my new one , it ingenious product , make " testing " water bit easier , when alone giving baby bath	1
i love this product -- it makes it easy see what temperature takes some stress out bathtime . it also unobtrusive so you still use bathtub shower normally . my husband skeptical it , but then he used it . when i took it off , he said he needed it give our 4 month old bath . i'm looking forward trying out infant tub	1
these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

i am 35 year power user electric shavers , many years those remington microscreen shavers . my very first original microscreen excellent shaver , but ni-cad batteries it died not readily replaceable . i several rotary shavers which never really worked well me . so i bought new microscreen which worked well me many years until batteries it also died . this shaver almost good these past shavers , but much less expensive . some disadvantages : screen not replaceable . but most other shavers , replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver . i use same aa rechargeable batteries it i use my digital camera , so batteries never going make whole shaver unuseable . it shave little slower than normal one . but backup shaver , travel , use car , etc , you find it hard beat	1
cuts close smooth . it 5 months now it still works great . would totally recommend it	1
i've never used anything but electric razor , while general i've happy their performance , i less than enamored last few shavers i've owned . my last one , basic braun model , left me oh-so-'80s miami vice look ; one before , norelco , literally fell apart my hands ( rotary heads fell out while i cleaning them , gently , brush provided manufacturer ) . those recent experiences make me doubly ecstatic remington r-960 titanium rotary shaver i got month ago amazon . shave closest i've ever received , shaver itself easy both clean recharge , going more than dozen shaves without needing recharge . ( spirit full disclosure , however , i must admit my beard only moderately heavy . ) some complained trimmer blade too broad , but it suits my sideburns just fine . particularly discount amazon offers , remington r-960 excellent , excellent buy	1

i think half reviews i've read ridiculous . read darn instruction manual . when it your 10% goal weight pops up , use user buttons go up down set it your actual goal weight . don't review item badly when you too stupid read directions correctly !!	1
i recently bought this scale , i think it great investment ! weight it accurate , it allows you both set weight goal , track it you're losing . reviewers who complained you can't set your own weight goal , you . when you set up your user number , it automatically gives you goal weight ( 10%) . per instruction booklet , you then use p1 p2 buttons raise lower number . great feature center balance . if you step scale aren't centered , weight change greatly . this scale , before your weight pops up , there lines going across it . side lines pointing side too much weight it . if you see small dot center , then you're standing it correctly , your weight accurate . course , other than user settings , it still average scale , someone who interested just getting their weight . i definitely think it worth-while .	1
i impressed this scale ! it easy use , easy read ! very happy this purchase .	1
i read this product parenting magazine decided give it try . after first use itself , i saw wonderful results . skin feels so soft supple it seems like those blemishes hidden . i use it every week i recommend it anyone who not time go out those one hour facials every other week but manage spend few minutes shower using this produc t.t he only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5 starts because i observed you very gently rub product into your skin if you not very gentle , you might end up red spots or burnt skin . this happened couple times but now i am very careful very gentle whil rubbing this product into my skin . i still highly recommend it	1

ibuprofen good over counter analgesic ( pain reliever ) works mild moderate pain . ibuprofen generic drug name , active ingredient advil motrin . it comes 200 milligam tablets/capsules . most mild aches , it quite effective . not only ibuprofen relieve pain , but it also real good anti-inflammatory medication ( it lessens swelling ) . thus it also good arthritis pain , any joint or muscle sprains or strains , real good toothache pain too . if two tablets taken , it equivalent previously prescription only product , " motrin " . two tablets , or 400 mg ibuprofen mild moderate pain . three tablets , 600 mg , moderate moderately severe pain . all three doses , 200 , 400 , 600 mg taken every 4 hours needed pain . four tablets highest prescribed dose ( 800 mg ) , should only taken once every 6 hours . reserve four tablet dosaging your really severe pain . 800mg dose equivalent tylenol #3 ( anetaminophen codiene ) , good pain reliever . how you purchase ibuprofen up you , but there some real good generic ibuprofen products less than half cost " name brand " products ( advil , motrin ) . both generic name brand equal terms strength effectiveness . only thing different name brand fancier packaging perhaps easier swallow dose forms . i buy my ibuprofen generic form ; not only i get it cheaper , i get more tablets too . jim " konedog " koenig	1

here what you want good nights sleep ! and/or if you mattress " butt holes " it , you put this topper over it you new mattress ! if needed you get large piece plywood this topper your mattress ! if you like it soft , then this may not you i find it bit firm , not hard , but firm . all homedics memory foam coolcore products , they " odor " ( clean one ) fades time . however one topper last bit longer than pillows unless you pull covers back during daytime keep window open . note it not bad offenside odor , but distinct one . keep mind , it comes big box heavy ( 41 pounds it says ) . so lookout delivery !!! price saves fifty bucks over others ! plus free shipping ! those who famuliar memory foam know how it heats up after you're it while ! but not homedics coolcore keeps it cool ( not cold , but cool ) . add this topper homedics pillow ( see my previous items ) you great nights sleep ! only negative it comes all rolled up , you lay it get " bumps " out after you unroll it it takes few hours ( don't expect lay it right away all smooth ) . they great job packaging it shrink plastic so you know it factory fresh , there bunch moisture eater packets inside , then it inside nifty white drawstring bag ( reusable) !! i must admit , price ( go mattress store see price higher end memory foam coolcore ) it really great !	1

this great product - it actually kind fun . i thought getting it because our friend one he passes around parties . it neat people see how high their blood alcohol content , if it what they expect it . my only complaint this product not meant used often . second time we " played " it ( home ) , readings seemed off . i then read product information if you use product frequently , it may need recalibrated every month or so . recalibration involves mailing it off paying $20 . now we know , we'll keep it our pocket use it when we truly concerns - not passing it around everyone use . but i love they sell these public use , it truly important safety tool modern times	1
i'm pretty happy this digital scale . it ready use out box , without any calibration needed . scale comes two small lithium batteries ( same kind used watches ) power scale itself . you pop 9v battery ( not included ) talking part . just step scale your weight appear lcd quickly . lcd easy read when there light . because it not backlit , so you won't able see your weight when lighting inadequate . scale fairly accurate . all digital scales , it never gives you exactly same reading if you step off step again . but variation acceptable . scale long warranty so case you think it not working , just send it warranty repairs . ( but honest , i think it'll cheaper just buy new one than paying postage . ) talking part not very exciting . english voice , faux female , quite annoying . i think it pretty easy understand , but voice too robotic . actually it also sounds like dog barking . short , this cheap digital scale pretty good	1

i am enjoying my new remington hair dryer ! it good choice , i believe . i especially like long power cord . it also very good not get tangled . my only complaint , if you want call it , i expected hair dryer would quieter than it . i checked around before i purchased it , one selling points it supposed operate more quiet than your average hair dryer , but i can't really hear much difference , if any . regardless , i am enjoying it	1
product great . we twins they don't stay still more than 5 seconds , impossible measure their temperature thermometers need more than 1 minute results . we already bought 3 these 1 didn't work very well . 2 them , batteries came very low , necessary change very soon . i recommend this ear thermomether though	1
i thick , wavy hair falls below my shoulders . it layered , shortest layer my chin . i also few fringes fall eye level . this flat iron better than 2 " conair i years finally died . i would agree it seems wider iron would work faster but it really doesn't , nor it work ay better . fact i think this one works better than wider one . it doesn't dry my hair out much ( if you think how much time your hair spends exposed heat each width plate , it makes sense ) i also find it easier make flips 1 " . it gets short pieces just nicely longer pieces . it heats up quickly i just fine 15 . comb attachment waste time my opinion , mostly due its tangling capabilities . i love it lock it it very light ; makes it great traveling . i hope this helps	1
i purchased this gift my niece who expecting . she seemed very pleased it . it part her gift registry said it exactly what she needed . i am happy this purchase	1
i using nature gate organics acne treatment system just under year now absolutely love results . i using kit uses benzoyl peroxide its main acne-fighting ingredient , but it really dried my skin out bleaching action peroxide ruined countless towels t-shirt necklines . so when friend recommended nature gate organics acne kit , i thought i'd give it try . after first kit , i've never even considered using anything else . i find salicylic acid based formula gentler my skin but still very effective clearing up breakouts preventing new ones . i've used salicylic acid products past without greatest results , but however nature gate organics acne product formulated , it works . ( according their packaging , it combination oligopeptide-10 makes salicylic acid more effective . ) it really important stick complete regimen , though . when i first started using kit , i used three products haphazardly , using cleanser one day but not toner lotion , etc . i could tell difference , though , when i followed package directions used all three . cleanser , toner lotion each their function i'm really happy how my skin feels looks when i use whole system . i've gotten lot compliments how good my skin looks , too , since i started using nature gate organics . this also first formula i've found didn't dry out my skin . i think most acne products formulated teens really oily skin . those us past puberty ( i'm 30+) but still dealing adult acne , we need products effective but gentle . fact it contains natural/organic ingredients added bonus . all those botanicals makes it smell great , too ! me , nature gate organics acne treatment perfect . i don't write lot reviews , but i felt compelled when i saw it posted here because i really believe this product . plus , i'm so glad amazon offering it such good price	1
this trimmer very nice job . i've used it wet dry environments without issue . i've even rinsed it under running water while it without any problems . so it fits bill wet/dry . only issue i opinion thing . lowest setting trim guard isn't close enough too close without trim guard . ( not sure proper name so i'm calling removable blade guard , which also acts trim gage , " trim guard " . ) i am very happy ease attachment removal trim guard . also height adjustment trim guard on/off very easy both wet dry environments . ease use wet/dry , i would give this item 5 . but overall close but not quite 5 star because 0 setting ( no trim guard ) close enough cut skin easily . if i wanted trim hair close i would just use razor shave	1
i got one @ walmart $9 . it simple sturdy like jazzfan says , it great reading if your woman sleeping . it also my default flashlight . i dropped it more times than i remember it still works .	1
i love this massager . when beginning use there bit discomfort but normal any deep massage . after first minute massagers adjusts size your leg pressure needs . i think it old saying " it hurts soooo good " . while using i didn't feel relaxation comes traditional massage , but later even next day benifiest clear convincing . i didn't leg cramps or tension while falling asleep i felt more energetic next day . if it less expensive i would give it 5 stars . amazon price excellent but since many could really use this machine limited income it shame price prevent many buying it .	1
this product wonderful . i bought three , one myself others my sisters . it smells delicious leaves my skin feeling clean . i highly recommend it	1
i bought this product my sister . she living small apt abt 400sqf w/4 cats 1 dog . it like zoo ! air not good everyone tell . i end up running noise everytime i stop . she suffers gerd nasal polyp . she seeing otolaryngologist tried chinese medicine acupuncture . nothing really helping . i heard people living animals same symptoms . unfortunately , she would not give up her pets even if she dies some sort fatal illness . so i thought air-purifier would help , least clean air her apt . i shopping around until i found this which best reviews . she using this product month , she coughs lot less than b4 feel air lot fresher . i definately recommend this product someone who pets don't want give them up .	1
i experiencing severe allergy symptoms so i researched air purifiers web while this one seemed best match me . it awesome . low setting , there no detectable sound but you walk up it feel air flowing so you know it working . i mainly use it one room it keeps room comfortable me . it 2 ft tall but not heavy easy move other rooms if needed . i not it long enough clean filters but when i installed filters initially , instructions easy follow installation very easy . i would recommend this product would purchase it again if i needed one	1
i using this cleanser over 15 years it still best , gentle , never harsh , non-drying . i admit this not everybody , i blessed enough genetics(my maternal grandmother ) not acne problems , but people normal oily skin , not get breakouts ; this one best cleansers use	1
if you sensitive skin this great product . i use it twice day , every day . it great morning get nice clean " canvass " upon which apply your makeup . it also nice job removing makeup evening . i love way this product cleans my face without leaving it feeling tight too dry they way some products . i naturally oily skin this product removes surface oil makeup leaves my skin feeling natural yet clean . this product little , no scent . entire cetaphil line this product designed sensitive skin non-comedogenic . i would recommend this product anyone wants clean their skin without removing all protective oils their skin . my dermatologist recommended this years ago , i am still happy consumer product	1
works like charm . so much easier clean than larger ones	1
i purchased several crane humidifiers thrown several them away : crane , two apples . i 2 elephants wouldn't buy any other models . elephants put out maximum amount humidity least amount problems . only problem i they leak under snout small extent . they easy clean we run them 24 hours day when we home . i would recommend them , but realize there some leaking you need put towel front them . i would buy additional elephants if needed .	1
this trimmer doesn't adjustable trim lever like i'm used , but it gets job	1
i bought different brand previously it horrible . it so loud neighor my apartment building actually thought fire alarm going off . convinced me it time try different razor . i got this because price only used it couple times , but i think it works great . based my experience it blows away competition . if you aren't happy it , it only cost one haircut .	1
when i plugged this model , i couldn't believe how quiet it compared previous model we owned . it worked great 2 weeks , then stopped collecting water . we followed all troubleshooting steps manual , but it still would not work . i very disappointed out $26 we spent shipping ..	-1
i like these wipes because they un-scented . also travel pack comes resealable top so you don't need seperate hard-sided container	1
i purchased this remington use travel shaver remington , model r-890 , several years , still use . i am well satisfied new model 845 tho ' i not use it much ; it use same shaving rotors head 890 . only drawback i find it cannot operate directly off power/recharging cord ; it only recharged run only off battery . 890 used either mode . but then , 845 comes more economical price than 890 . overall i find remington good shaver no inclination try or switch any other make	1
i wish i paid more attention details before choosing this shaver . i paid $5 more than non-rechargeable wish i just gotten cheaper one . this particular model only works battery . if battery dies , it not plugged used . you wait it charge . other than , it nice job	1
okay , i bought this item walmart while ago . this product nothing treat/prevent acne further breakout . i know it cheap one , but also it doesn't work all ... i'd say try either proactiv or klear action . if those don't work then you'd seriously see doctor/surgeon laser treatment permanently get rid acne acne scars	-1
i've using eucerin few years am definitely sticking it . it fragrance-free perfect sensitive skin ( acne-prone skin , too ) . feel very lightweight , but coverage excellent . unlike other moisturizers ( like some neutrogena or oil olay ) , i never apply second layer combat dryness . it worth price . i use it under make-up well .	1
this one simpliest , fastest , most compact roller set i've ever used . it limited 5 large 5 medium ionic rollers ; easy set , easy heat , easy remove . results soft , non-frizzy , wavy hair keeps all day . i used almost daily great results . its tiny footprint allows this set go easily travel .	1

i tried many " non-oily " sunscreens use my face , but i am always left heavy feeling my skin sunscreen smell . i recently bought this one my grocery store use vacation arizona california . i pleasantly surprised this product- it doesn't feel oily or heavy when applied once dry feels though i am not wearing sunscreen my face . i spent two weeks out west plenty sun time never burned . i would highly recommend this sunscreen anyone who hates sunscreen feeling their face , but doesn't want premature aging or skin cancer ! excellent product	1
make long story short , i can't even think shaving daily blades because irritation . i also own 5-year-old high-end norelco rotary ( like it quite bit ) , but i only get close shave it while shaving ( wet ) every 3-4 days , i shave it ( dry ) daily only minor irritation , but not close shave ... not close all ! after researching insatiably , i decided try foil electric ( panasonic or braun ) because almost every review i read said it provides less irritation closer shave than rotary , it better shorter hairs , making it ideal daily shaving . my plan buy braun , use it 30 days , return it then give panasonic try next 30 days , then choose one i liked most . let me put it this way , i know it takes skin 2-4 weeks get used new shaving system ; i owned braun total three days ( that right , 3 shaves ) i honestly tell you i not returning it , not even thinking trying out panasonic . this best shave i ever my life , period ! first shave wasn't close i expecting , but after running it through cleaning system , next two shaves spectacular ... close , smooth not one bit irritation ! oh , don't pay attention those who complain cleaning station loud ... i can't even hear damn thing while shower running , it only makes noise 5 minutes , after it all quiet ... plus it this really cool blue light gives my sink counter very high tech look	1
i agree previous review , they very high quality vitamins but very difficult swallow . i grind them coffee bean blender then add them whey protien shake , seems works very well	1
... so all people who follow me around asking , " what wonderful fragrance you ?

obviously strange comparison teases mind further explanation . may i suggest test drive encompass all aspects thorough trial . first , equipment : exceptionally well engineered intended purpose . sleek design beckons , try me , hands-on approach . well placed highly responsive controls cover all requirements . all seasons wet or dry duty kind animal respected heritage . floating heads firm or soft ride really make difference where linear activated blades meet whiskers . course real issue resultant tribute supremely close comfortable shave . my last experience electric shavers ended my lust one during 1950 . baskets used blades mountains lather my constant companions until recently which point i dared explore mans ' progression species . you believe ? technology , innovation , divine inspiration , dare achieve . there hope yet our survival i base my conclusion solely benefits able finally enjoy without hassel or fear " joy shaving " . system works best me soften my whiskers warm water soap , rinse , then apply 50/50 mix shaving gel penetrating lotion . i call this my 98% shave ( compared blade shave ) . without hesitation i say this my favorite , if not best , purchase amazon . perhaps this simple evaluation but none less one passed all tests ease .	1
recommended " so you'd like start wearing cologne " guide amazon ( which i bought reviewed them all ) this cologne almost perfect male fragrance . term comes mind this case " eq " . it just perfect range scents very well balanced bass , mids , high notes . it not too citrusy like many other colognes i happen like , it more serious definitively male . comparatively it more serious version tommy , more sex-scent oriented than hugo , broad spicy mid-range . it doesn't over-amount top notes never make it your skin , this cologne dependable smell like it when you put it hours later .	1

because family history skin cancer ( non-fatal , fortunately ) , i must wear sunblock my face all time , even just walking outside nyc . since i usually apply sunblock just after shaving , choice product very important . my dermatologist suggested i might try this neutrogena sunblock . it very high spf blocks uv rays , seems dry up entirely without any evidence it ever there . apparently they added ultra-fine silica powder which contains greasy look feel . any case , i liked it it seems work very well . unscented , which good me too	1
while most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn , you know very few them actually protect against photodamage ? photodamage damage sun your skin symptoms which brown spots , wrinkles such . only two sunscreen ingredients protect against long uvai rays cause photodamage ; zinc oxide parsol 1789 . zinc oxide protects broader range these rays than parsol 1789 . this sunscreen parsol 1789 ( avobenzone ) . it good , certainly offers more photo damage protection than most , but sunscreen zinc oxide would better still . zinc oxide also less irritating , it even found some baby care products . because parsol 1789 chemical rather than physical sunscreen like zinc oxide , some may experience irritation neutrogena dry touch . this neutrogena goes very smooth dry you can't even tell you wearing suncscreen . this very nice , although it bit scent which i don't like ( i would prefer it non scented , i don't like smelling like soap-neutrogena , you listening ? ) . all all , money this good sunscreen either your face or your body it particularly good oily skin it make your skin seem less oily . but if you willing spend bit more money , check out zinc oxide sunscreen such skinceuticals ultimate 30 which offers bit more protection less irritating ( zinc oxide less irritating parsol 1789 ) . most certainly least get sunscreen parsol 1789 such this one	1
this basic unit lot like one gramma used , but it safe reliable not expensive some i've seen ( offer no more features additional cost ) .	1

my parents bought me electric razor christmas , my first . god-awful razor actually good learning experience , because it taught me few select things : 1 . i hard time keeping daily shaving routine . i'm always liable skip day . 2 . wet/dry shaving electric actually better than using blade . 3 . nicd batteries , their 8-hour recharge time , huge annoyance . schick ( didn't know they made electric razors , you ? ) i couldn't shave my growth if i skipped day , my facial hair doesn't even grow all fast . addition , order properly charge shaver , i supposed completely discharge shaver , then recharge ( presumably avoid memory effect nicd batteries ) . ultimately , this meant one or two shaves out week ended halfway through process . i went back using blades while . but some unknown force compelled me peruse electric shaver section fry one day . after comparing boxes , i settled this one $ ... it honestly more than i wanted spend , but i figured i could return it if it didn't measure up . first shave panasonic proved me whole " 30-day acclimation period " crap . this thing worked immediately , fresh out box , better than my old shaver ever could . dry . wet shaving , while more involved , shaves much closer while not causing much irritation . battery meter nice feature , but kicker fast recharge time . even if shaver dies , 5-10 minutes all i need it running again . i also don't worry " memory effect " ni-mh batteries . integrated trimmer foils actually works , means i actually shave every-other-day it still its job well . cleaning involves running it under faucet bit hand soap . all this said , there some caveats . hairs my neck still somewhat pesky , won't go away without fight . i experiment find best direction come them panasonic . i'm sure more expensive shavers might easier time them . also , this thing really should come some sort stand . it comes cloth bag traveling , but no stand . get rid nose-hair trimmer ( which i no use ) just give me basic stand so i place set shaver dry . while i could spent less shaver similar features , i'd hard pressed find one this price everything well , without any major annoyances . it wet-dry , charges fast shaves well . only thing i'm not looking forward buying replacement blades , but if it continues work like it past 6 months , i can't really complain .	1
bathroom scales what i expected , i no problems them	1

i lot trouble dry air hotels when i travel , especially during winter mountains . this good humidifier easily fits into carry bag . biggest problem i it it doesn't quite last night sleep . so what i right after checking , i would turn humidifier high . go out , eat dinner , etc . then just before going sleep , i would refill it set it low . even though it would run out , humidity would comfortable level . so i sleep restfully . notes : it get area around it wet , so you may want set it towel ( plenty extra hotels ) . depending water quality , it leave mineral-like deposits . so you may need clean it after each use ( or maybe use filtered water ) .	1

i'm waiting book come out called " 101 ways use magic erasers " because i'll bet there 101 ways least . these sponges pick upi dirt you didn't even know there . let me tell you some ways i put them use : 1 . used it kitchen walls/ceiling remove dirt/grease film - looks like new . ( not recommend using flat finish or cheaper paints though without checking area first ) . 2 . used it quickly remove soap scum shower/tub without use chemicals . 3 . used it remove car wax black plastic portions my car ( don't you hate it when you get wax there you can't get it off ? )4 . used it my kitchen counter remove wine stain . 5 . used it get gumminess off things i purchased those annoying gummy labels them . i am still finding uses these . they recommend not using them wood i agree . i tested it it remove finish . however if you planning refinish your natural wood ( not painted ) kitchen cabinets something like rejuvenate cabinet restorer ( also great product ) then i recommend cleaning them magic eraser first improve adherence ( worked me , but test it first inside cabinet door make sure you see good results too ) . note - this not like your typical sponge not replace typical sponge ... but instead remove dirt where traditional psonge can't . magic erasers disintigrate you use them so they not last long traditional sponge . bj club used sell their own brand magic eraser ( less $) , but i not seen them there awhile .	1

get hot lather , which nice , you first get device installed top . i would not recommend this if you easily frustrated . directions provided sparse several languages . first you pry top off shaving cream . they provide pry tool purpose which works well some brands shaving cream better than others . then you fit device top . it worked well one brand large size . when i tried it smaller size shaving cream it emptied half during installation process . using different brand large , i trouble prying top off . if you time patience , willing spend some money various brands shaving cream find one works well , give it try . otherwise , forewarned it may lead frustration bad language . it would nice if companies intending sell products us ( apparently manufactured somewhere asia ) would provide clear set instuctions english , reasonable large readable type , illustrations . this case , they need clearly specify type shaving cream unit designed . i not need instructions foreign languages , get tired limited instructions six languages	-1

i recently purchased this lumbar support cushion gift my father this past christmas . i am physical therapist , over 5 years experience dealing primarily mechanics mechanisms low back pain disc dysfunction . i tried out many cushions over years , my experience , this product good any higher-priced product same intent . composite board insert allows consistent shape maintained , so cushion not yield easily body weight over years consistent use , burgundy cover removable washable . it also excellent size average-sized person ( my dad approximately 5'9 " , ~ 170 lbs . ) . it provides good side-bolster support well added feeling comfort around outiside lower back . i highly recommend this cushion when placed comparison other similar products . most other products out there contention this one composed unnecessary additives , like massager , ribbing contours cushion , etc . i've found simply maintaining good posture ( not only sitting , but all activity ) allows so much more freedom pain simple ease back into daily life . again , i highly recommend this product anyone out there searching answer help alleviate low back pain ; however , i must caution commercial products not cure-all one problems . it always possible alleviate pain symptoms , but other steps necessary terms fixing problem . i highly recommend seeking out professional care physical therapist , it more than likely necessary one would need ( least ) proper education intevention help one get better .	1

if you suffer folliculitis , this may just razor you waiting ! i tried mach 3 few different times over years but all it would take just one shave , boom !, my face would break out folliculitis . although gillette claims mach 3 reduces irritation , i always found it super irritating . two things seem different fusion . closer spacing blades seems genuinely reduce irritation i found mach 3 . mach 3 always seemed dig into my face scrape away layers skin . not so fusion ! second , it seems me way fusion shaver cartridge mounted handle makes better angle shave . i haven't noticed gillette makes any claim way fusion blade mounted any different mach 3 , but still , i think it slightly different . i always felt like leading edge mach 3 shaver cartridge too sharp angle against my skin . it seems like fusion avoids this mounting " hinge " farther back shaving cartridge . thus , rubber fins front blades makes cartridge ride more level or flat over face . truly improvement however it achieved ! also , before i used fusion , i thought five blades little ridiculous . i figured you could never get close front ears , under nose , etc . however , i found five blades aren't ridiculous . special trimmer blade nice but i find i don't hardly need it . i get into close spaces generally without it . end , i used fusion enjoyed totally comfortable shave ! no folliculitis outbreaks resulted my use it ! i really like razor	1

pro : shave close blades . it may take while , but it get job . ( based just my person experience , comparing braun 1000 , 4000 . 500 , 8000 , new norelco speedxl , panasoic linear ) . con : poor build quality all area , look feel , fits noise level ( loud ) , shake , power connector , so . ( new norelcos similar problems - look feel cheap . far less solid than my old faithful quadra . braun panasoic feel better build . brauns pleasure my eyes hands . but unfortunately , no one shaves close remington)and it shaver after all it supposes shave . if this remington doesn't last ( i my reasons bit worried ) , i get one same . only hope remington least keep their technology intact over time . ( side note , among all auto cleaning systems , one comes braun 8000 series really works : fast , clean , easy get shaver out station , charge wash separately . too bad remington doesn't come close washer technology , braun doesn't cut close ! ) p.s. i no beard or mustache , but lots whiskers all directions around under chin . all other shavers i've tried simply won't go there . difference loud clear , literally : when whiskers got cut down , you hear it . all shavers work great initial cutting phase . but only remington continues after , while all others just empty runs , my fingers clearly tell me there're more cut . bottom line : try it . don't get scared away bad raps web . i tried remington my last resort . i never regret i	1

sunbeam flexible heating pad some nice features . built elastic bands hold it place . it wrap easily around any body part . it relativly comfortable , except over-sized connector pad power cord which always digging some part your body . but real problem heating . pad heats well 5 minutes then shuts off . unit shows its , but there no heat . unit not heat up again half hour . like many cheaper heating pads , i believe this some kind thermal-couple saftey kicks out certain temperture . then fails kick back until unit cools completly . i found this heating pad many high end features comfort , but heats like cheap heating pad . heat what heating pad all . its reason after owning many heating pads i willing dish out almost $40 this heating pad . heat . sunbeam just doesn't deliver . finally after using this heat pad 2 dozen times , it started smell like burning plastic . so garbage it goes . $39 down drain . after alittle product study i found real high end heating pads thermophore theratherm . check out their customer satisfaction amazon . i just purchased theratherm because you set temperture degrees . it seems work well , but early tell . i'll update future	-1

here few positives negatives i hope help :( +) it work , however some places-like your bikini line-where hair tends lay flat you need pull skin tight . (-) it hurts , bad . it slow painful process . (+) hair doesn't nearly long if you waxing . (-) hair goes everywhere . there no little storage area hair , this thing just rips it out flies it all over room . you it tub . (+) it easy clean , brush comes it works well , but i wish they gave extra one because i just know bristles start sticking out any-which-way after while . (-) battery not very good , you keep it plugged if you plan using it more than fifteen minutes . (+) it came cute bag store it . (+) i haven't shaved two weeks ! i probably wont two . bottom line i like it , i'm happy it continue use it . i wish i could gotten better one but i couldn't get shipping hawaii more pricey ones	1

here why .... i searched high low decent lighted makeup mirror similiar one i years . my old mirror windmere , lasted 12 years . prior i clairol ( lighting just ok ) . days web searches led me those horrible round halo lighted mirrors ( they just look good counter ) serve no purpose . this jerdon basically same mirror my old windmere . very sturdy , great lighting , large rectangle mirror , side mirrors , vertical 360 ' rotation , 5x magnification reverse side mirror 11 mirror positions , also extra electrical outlet front appliances . issue regarding previous reviewers complaints lighting . you must hold button down 3 seconds allow bulbs light . lighting this mirror superior others i seen . it weighs 6 lbs folds nicely away . negatives this mirror : bulbs make slight buzzing noise when use ( typical this type bulb ) electrical outlet installed upside down my product , therefore mirror must collapsed lower position allow enough room plug . i consider these minor complaints considering product services all my needs . if you want go out house looking like you intend , this mirror you . i would definitely buy again	1

i've tried many pheromones consider myself something " expert " . i'm not biochemist , so take this what it worth : androstenone pheromone which attract attention women , but only some women only when they're ovulating . so if you want one-night stand hookup , get something lot androstenone ( like pherone d-17x , which i'm also reviewing ) . problem androstenone it also quickly intimidating or turn women off if they're not ready it . so better choice product like m-11 which other pheromones " modulate " androstenone ( doesn't too much androstenone ) . this one turn women but doesn't scare them off . other hand , if you're all intimidating kind guy , what you really need my favorite one , v-5 , which no androstenone all . v-5 my every-day phero , i use m-11 going out clubs . it works me ! way , if you smell it means your using too much . some other companies make " odor free " pheromones . what really means they don't put much phero their products . so just use little bit . dab'll ya	1

these diapers fantastic ! i myself prefer cloth diapers , but because we high water table if we much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck ! i am also severely chemically sensitive so scent " normal " diapers even seventh generations ones gel make me ill . but these great !! they made wood pulp/paper feel if there cotton them . they no chemical scent all feel nice soft smooth my fingers . they close means adhesive strip either side closes onto larger piece thin plastic either side . if you accidentally close adhesive strip paper it tear when you pull it back off usually not reseal . this not problem if you use them only once . we potty our baby so sometimes we take it off put it back few times before it gets wet or dirty . other than accidentally sticking strips paper i haven't problem using them like this . there elastic legs but it basically encased so it isn't contact skin they snug enough my baby legs . these little harder tell if they wet than seventh generation ones ( i've never used regular diapers since i can't get near them their chemical scent ) because there isn't gel . i usually just put finger it then touch finger my thumb then i tell if i feel dampness or not . if my baby pees lot though it easy tell if it wet ... even outside because it look little more molded form , but not feel damp outside inside less damp even then than cloth diaper . packaging says you should not let baby put these his/her mouth since it paper tear off their mouth it should not held near flame - again because it made out paper . but all said , these not flimsy all , they well made hold up just well regular disposable . i highly recommend these anyone who whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or those times when impractical ( day care ) those people who want limit their baby exposures chemicals	1
we used our fsa balance two purifiers , other hunter quietflo . this rabbit air purifier great . house smells lot fresher . we dog two cats , my husband i suffer certain allergies , we live humid south - it amazing how much dust odor we breathing . this machine quiet easy use . sensors seem work very well - opening front or back door , dog walking past it , cooking smoke or odor - so i leave it auto most time . comparison , hunter quietflo ( 30119 ) lot less expensive , two filters , only one control knob . so far , it captured only smaller particle dust where rabbit air gets small larger particle dust some fur . " o-o zone " much better . i've tried purifier sharper image which not capture much only made air smell like ozone - gave me headaches ! i definitely recommend this brand room air purifier over others . it worth money	1

one-battery trimmers simply not strong enough , glad find two-batteries version . it perfect design which attract many more naive surfers like me . unfortunately it not good nose hair trimming . problem it makes electric-like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose . so much it makes you scared using it ;-) it also doesn't cut well , doesn't reach inside , makes burning smell overheated . update 2/7/2007 : my recent experience , microtouch turbo excellent alternative which no problems mentioned above . only problem its durability ( you may find yourself buying 2 per year ) but price below $10 this not real issue . good luck	-1
you could get same info " percentage " body fat going online . think it : how scale " measure " your body fat ? good question . so i went website manufacturer ... surprise , surprise ... there no details how this worked . it , however , note what it supposed detect how might connect body fat . scale supposedly measures something called " electrical impedence " which sounds pretty complex but really isn't all hard understand . all it means more fat you your body , more " impedence " you higher body fat reading . electricity doesn't flow well through fat scale supposed detect . but here catch - getting accurate body fat measurement not possibly just stepping scale , especially if consumer ( buyer ) scale doesn't understand factors vital accurate measurement . what you your body when you step scale one vital factor . here just one example how easy it would get bad reading : if you dehydrated not drinking enough water or , conversely , you overhydrated drinking too much water or you haven't measured your body fat within certain amount time after exercise or you've standing too long or you've eaten recently ..... you very likely get inaccurate reading you'll confused variation readings one day next , not knowing what factor or combination factors affecting your reading . even worse , you'll no real idea your body fat . what i've seen , these scales provide accurate weight measurements . but when it comes measuring body fat , ads or website not seem indicate you get inaccurate reading if you step scale wrong time day , too soon after exercising , if you thirsty , etc . so save your money . if you working out regularly , eating right , getting shape , etc .... odds your body fat dropping you'll see signs this . you don't need this scale prove it ( although you might consider it worthwhile discover your actual body fat some other way ) . signs reduced body fat firmer muscles , looser clothes ( often ) more streamlined figure . your metabolism likely more efficient , assuming you don't overeat too much . if you absolutely know your percentage body fat , just ask your local physician , trainer or gym director how get accurate assesment when so . if you workout regularly suggested or peak training level , your body fat should go down , assuming you don't compensate eating too much . so don't count this scale give you consistency or quality detailed controlled body fat measurement . it won't .	-1

you shave anything without putting future fatherhood risk , though it takes some patience get things really smooth . i've used it repeatedly over past three months without any major problems . my skin little sensitive after first time , but no terrible pain or anything , there none all now i'm accustomed using it . it possible nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving , but if you read instructions first you should fine . couple very minor drawbacks : it rather noisy , more so than regular electric razor , if you use comb attachments , it tough remove them without also removing foil screen same time . but pops right back , so not big dea	1

i say i converted . over 15 years now i lived razor . i pretty thick beard it grows fast too . i am kind guy gets 5 o'clock shadow noon . i used every single type razor out there disposable battery operated vibrating type one blade 5+1 blade . i tried all brands ended up feeling gillette brand best type razor , but now i find it not best shave . i used electric shaver several years back , it one top line norelco incorporated gel . it gave me pretty bad razor burn not get all hairs ; i ended up shave normal . -- true story -- i am manager my job my last annual review only item i marked bad my personal appearance . not i dress bad or not wear deodorant , but they felt i didn't shave often . ( i shave very least every other day , usually every day ) . so i felt i so something it . i researched electric shavers thinking i could get quick shave during my lunch hour my car or least my way work so it would last longer . i found panasonic seems leading pack moderately priced all features expensive models . instruction manual explicit saying it take 30 days get used any new shaving method they assure you love panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used way it cut . i using it almost 30 days now , i not live without it . i never this close shave before . i actually go 2 days without getting shadow . my fianc� found new love touching my face , i seem getting more kisses too ! during first 2 weeks i get couple missed hairs my old gillette , but today officially i able through my gillette away good . ( my boss even asked what i am doing different when i told him , he went out bought one too , he also loves it now . my fianc� said she would leave me if i stopped using panasonic , it good thing panasonic around decades ) so , i am raving his product , but every good its bad ... what bad ? well , it gets couple weeks get used shave , but amount time i am planning use it money i am saving buying razors every month , i handle . cleaning system very good , but it takes very long clean ( 2-3 hrs ) it noisy since base turns shaver off during cleaning cycles . cleaning cartage said last 3 months whether you use it once day or one week . i not gotten point yet , but it very very easy clean shower some body wash . i just end up using base drying cycle , which option . batter very good . month i used it , i charged it twice but it really didn't need it it said charge good . overall ... excellent product . could there better shaver out there , maybe , i ever know ... this time , i am not worried it , i am very satisfied this panasonic , don't think it get any better . this product not include cleaning base . i recommend it even if you don't use it clean razor , you use it dry it , it help keep your blades newest condition prevent them rusting when air drying . but , if you looking save money get excellent razor , this it !	1

maybe people below me who said lotion doesn't get warm using thicker lotion or something ( i use vaseline intensive care ) , but my lotion warm point almost too hot put my skin . since i am always cold , lotion warm otherwise my skin just turns goosebumps i don't get absorption i need . since using this my skin lot softer . great product	1
i not buy this product amazon , but through retailer ( cheaper ) . i my research first came across all reviews this product amazon . since it less than $40 , i decided give it shot . i own this product roughly two months now . i am stationed overseas decided cough up $40 vs . $8 haircuts once week . it more than paid itself no time . i give myself simple haircut once week ( just one length throughout ) . some user comments amazon not affect me i felt compelled tell it : 1 . binding . just keep your hair short trim often it won't bind . what else you expect cordless trimmer . they not put out power compared corded electric one . even trimmer plugged , it still bind . i found this out very first time i used it . my hair 1 1/2 inches long . yes , it bind ( first time ) . after keeping my hair setting 8 ( roughly 1/4 inch ) , it not bind anymore . 2 . setting dial gets accidently turned . i never problem . besides , way i hold shaver my thumb permanently planted dial anyway so it prevent it turning . other reviewers who this problem may holding it wrong way . it require little finesse , but you'll get hang it second or third time . 3 . ease cleaning . description not lie when it says submersible . easy clean removable blades . water not affect this trimmer all . very good water-proof design panasonic . 4 . comes little oil bottle small brush . i clean thing every single time i use it so it ready go next time . just oil blades after every use ( panasonic recommended oiling before after ) . i found too much oil make it harder clean because hair sticks more water can't simply wash it out . 3 . overall this trimmer good go . save me lot $ during my 1 year deployment . plus good thing i don't wait line anymore get 5 minute haircut !!! hope this helps	1
after reading lot reviews here , i decided try this dryer . i dryer i love , but i thought i should try find back-up inevitable time when mine dies . one i vortex dryer(with bell shaped end ) lifts hair it dries wonderful ! anyway , i can't find same model , so i tried this revlon model . oh my ... i shoulder length color treated hair , kind medium thickness i ended up fuzzy mess ! i gave up before it quite dry went back my other dryer . i wish i would time start over , but i would late work . ugh .... hate bad hair day . thing .... on/off switch bad place . i kept turning it off i using it ! my thumb kept hitting switch . so .... its not me , but ymmv(your mileage may vary )	-1

i previously ordered shower stools more bench-shaped . but legs always ended up warping weight ( even though i'm just average sized ) stools ultimately ended up sagging becoming uneven . however , after few months using this shower stool , i am optimistic not happen due better-shaped design . i also like size much better anyway , since my shower stall not big . stool big enough me sit comfortably , but doesn't take up lot space . it fairly easy put together . it sturdy it hasn't rusted . i am very happy it .	1

i using various shavers over 40 years . i tried most major brands . past , i preferred remington because it powerful fast . but remington irritates my skin . braun less powerful less irritating , but still irritating . i previously used norelco rotary , perhaps 15 years ago , but it too slow not close enough . however , although most shavers remain pretty much same over years , this norelco giant step improved above prior models . it shaves faster , much easier clean . old norelco difficult clean . this shaver cleaned very well just hot water . however , i use soap lubricant . ( if you use oily stuff , marketed various pre-shaves , which basically puts film oil your face , there tendency gunk accumulate under blades . i recommend just using ordinary soap . ) this new model norelco larger blades , better shape , allowing closer faster shave . also , it much quieter than back forth models . think inefficiency ramming blades ordinary shaver back forth . rotary energy here more efficiently quietly goes shaving beard . i aged , my beard become less dense . if you tough beard , thick beard , you may prefer alternative . however , if you want close shave , quiet mechanism , which relatively easy clean , i recommend this norelco . you may not need well designed cleaning bay , may prefer just shaver charger . i hardly use cleaning system because just hot water works so well , using soap lubricant . interesting , brochure recommends just clean , dry face . i found soap works better . anyway , i would recommend this shaver one best available . long trial period suggests manufacturer own confidence its product	1

this great item . i purchased one each bathrooms my condo i love them . installation breeze , took all 5 minutes . plus directions give you option take out " low-flow " filter areas ( such area i live ) already low water pressure . old shower heads i didn't give me this option so i low water pressure plus low flow filters - which meant virtually trickle shower . so nice take real shower again !	1
some pens fat , some thin , most people preference . if you like fat pen , this handsome black-and-chrome item good candidate . it satisfyingly heavy reasonably wel balanced . i think cross great job satin black finishes generous chrome appointments give this pen bold appearance without becoming gauche . writing quality good , though you find better higher price . consider this pen audi a6 writing instruments , entry-level luxury may not compete mercedes but certainly fun drive	1
i can't use this bracelets , it makes them too big they slide off my wrist . also , clasp really heavy so if i use it necklace , it always hanging front , it not attractive . waste money , i never actually used it .	-1
i'm guy , this review coming guy point view . i absolutely loathe cleaning . i live studio apartment really shouldn't too hard clean , but it me becuase how much i love ie : hate ) cleaning . anything could make this easier great thing my opinion . so i got this magicreach kit , figuring it'd ok , maybe little better than my swiffer . i say i really like it . very simple , easy put togehter , overall just nice device . kit i got came mop pads tub tile pads . tub tile pads need moistened prior use then soap needs rinsed . mopping pads pre-moistened left dry . reading instructions helps you figure this out quickly , but i guess its easier skip step then get angry write one star reviews . maybe that more satisfying . its true mop pads drip few drops you put them device . somehow getting few drops cleaning solution surface you're mop doesn't seem like problem , but what i know ? i suppose those drops give away plan attack , taking away element surprise . my guess your dirt won't able run fast enough , even advance warning . if your dirt outrun you , then i suggest you find cleaner place live , consider changing few personal habits too . if you take few seconds read instructions use little brain power before using this thing i think you'll find you'll love this device	1

i experienced some tooth sensitivity this product , but much less than crest whitestrips . read other reviews - sensitivity vary person person . i like this product better than strips because it covers more teeth . no , it not cover all them - you would get zoom treatment your dentist or some other full treatment . however , this kit fast cheap . i noticed difference tooth color after using it twice two weeks . so , you may need buy multiple kits more effect . also , avoid getting it your gums rinse thoroughly after use . i burned my lower gumline little first time because i didn't wash it out well enough .	1
i purchased this shaver gift my husband he submitted following review : i older norelco not pivoting head extra shaving slots . i thought new shaver would one-up my older norelco so i ordered 9160xl . well , my opinion , there no difference quality shave nor reduction shaving time . so i returned shaver continue use my less featured , older model . i would , however , ordered very satisfied 9160xl if i didn't already norelco i feel it best electric shaver market --- i've tried most all them	1

i just got this today excited try it out ! i followed exact instructions dissapointed because i could barely see mist coming out top . i thought it broken but after leaving see if mist would eventually get stronger it not . but , nice part this i knew it not broken because within minutes my whole place really nice scent drafting through . i added just few drops aromatherapy oil diffused scent wonderfully ! other " aromatherapy diffusers " i never diffused scent well this one . it couple hours now scent just it begining . i gave it only 4 stars since i still barely see mist coming out , but i know it there because smell . if you want something diffuse your aromatherapy oils but don't really mind not mist visible , then this great job . if you want mist , i would not recommend this . me , aromatherapy much more important	1

i saw lot people complaining this straightener , but it really work well me . it mainly depends your hair type - if you very thick , bushy , or curly hair , you might want use more professional high quality straightener , but if you thin hair , or fairly thick wavy hair like myself , then it'll work beautifully . other reviewers complained plates " aren't ceramic " - actually , they . if it burning your hair , then obviously , you need turn down heat , there dial straightener allows you , guide how high you should heat depending your hair type . i've using this straightener while , my hair not burnt , my split ends even reduced switching this one my old one , my old one used much more expensive supposedly " higher quality " than this one . this definitely isn't everybody , but considering it not too costly , there no real harm just giving it try	1

there no 100% accurate scale . so you just get best one money . i've used different scales i'm happy taylor . i've seen this scale $50.00 most websites . i know lot people rated this scale kind poor . however , it not this scale only , all scales get rated poor . scale offensive object . it tells things people don't want know . people complain inaccuracy measuring fat . it approximate , all scales work same way . so wether you buy plus $100.00 scale , or this low price taylor , it same accuracy . one thing you got ask yourself although measuring fat approximate , approximate amount help you lose weight ? my answer would yes . so spend extra few dollars get fat analyzer scale . finding scale lifetime warranty very hard . scales wear out use , so i'm surprised this company offer . negative : it took me 10 minutes program scale reading instructions 4 times . so it not easiest instructions follow	1

i quite bit research these scales live up reviews i read ( almost all which positive ) . they very repeatable . i add one negative note however . they trying control too many functions too few buttons . holding button wrong length time cause you enter incorrect mode . i am not unintelligent person , but it took me 4 5 tries instructions finally set up memory features correctly . they great since i finally got it though	1
