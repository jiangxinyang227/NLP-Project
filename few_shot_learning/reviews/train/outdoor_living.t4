these lights don't hold charge . i called manufacturer they said these " summer/spring " lights require 12 hours direct sunlight work . ad amazon not say . i even charged batteries using wall charger they still barely held charge ( 1 - 2 hours ) . they also very dim lights . don't waste your money	-1

this metal detector nice , notwithstanding , it performs poorly when all metal mode . initially all metal mode works fine , however , after half hour use batteries begin wear out battery low indicator not come . when all metal mode used after half hour detector use , it just squeals uncontrollably . it supposed go off over metal pin point source your initial find great accuracy . again , after thirty minutes use detector , it no longer go off over source , it just go off constantly , no mater where you hold it . i could hold it into air it still squeals . i made every adjustment i could it just continues make noise . this mode worthless unless your using it two fresh 9 volt batteries every half hour . finally , if you're hunting say meteorites four hours , you expect spend over $56.00 batteries afternoon	-1

i am owner kamado , purchased august 2000 when company wan located sacramento , ca . after owning unit less than two years , i started develop cracks interior kamado . company would not replace or honor life time warranty unit . since time tiles come loose sheets i defective unit unsightly not what i purchased supposed lifetime warranty . all calls emails company would not resolve defects materials workmanship . company answer glue tiles back unit . this not acceptable unit this cost . check see if you unit made ceramic materials or portland cement case mine . unless kamado changed their manufacturing process ensenada , mexico units made portland cement . this material not last carries no lifetime warranty . i am sorry give them one star , they don't negative star number . check out this company san diego bbb sacramento bbb read before you buy . there various website deal thefraud kamado group . their website not allow any truthful posts . truthful posts removed almost immediately . they say ebay , buyer beware , fraud , not what they represen t.t here true ceramic cookers out there sale , truly ceramic not ceramic coated tiles grout . good luc	-1

one star lowest rating i give this system it frankly not worth even . problems start design . you take out eight tiny little screws insert backup batteries or plug sensor cable into nifty looking " solar powered " sender unit , which placed somewhere full sunlight it function all . once you've mounted unit your roof , you remove those pesky little screws roof , freezing wind usually , several times winter . or wait spring nice weather when you don't need know if you expect black ice your early morning drive work . sometimes resetting base station works ( which you place inconveniently so unit direct line sight communication . usually not . os sales it advertised 300 feet , but actually something less than forty if your batteries more than day old ( see battery change procedure above ) . way , there backup nicad battery unit , supposedly kept charged impressive solar power collector . this fail because it rapidly loses capacity due poor discharge recharge cycle . if any these three fail , unit won't function . strangely enough , my rain gauge ( i live desert ) continued function over year little attention . however , temp/humidity sensor which i would like refer most often , what fails every night . i'd like replace nicad battery , but can't find one anywhere . ahem . customer service lack it . i don't know how many emails i've sent . or calls i've placed . or time i've spent listening backside oregon scientific hold button . their website only lists complete systems replacement parts category . while assumptions dangerous , my only option seems scrap $300 worth two-year old hardware buy more , more , more . this well-intended gift . i'm trying make it work . but it doesn't , usually when i need it most .	-1
we took chance these part father day gift piece metal acts spring broke after only 1 use . after reading reviews i called company instead returning refund . they very nice sent out one . this one just broke - exactly like other one - after month use . overall design tongs great like other raichlen products but construction severely lacking . don't waste your money this model .	-1

i more or less forced buy this product because i very precise size requirements this product fitted them . i very disappointed quality product cost . it comes 19 different pieces , all which hollow plastic polymer . it fairly lightweight , which could good or bad depending what you plan it . $200+ price , you'd think they would include shelf , but they only give you stencil make it yourself out ' shelving material ' . my biggest complaint i missing four pieces other extra pieces when i received it . i got bounced back forth amazon suncast customer service before i got right people suncast send me replacement parts ( which took over week arrive ) . top , they didn't even send me right replacement parts ! after phone call explanation , more parts sent . if i keep extras i , make couple more calls , i may enought second shed . ugh . directions ok , but they'll make you scratch your head you look through all similiar looking parts . especially when they don't send you right pieces	-1

you won't find single expert hummingbirds who recommends " instant nectar " products such this one . why ? because 1 ) they're complete waste your money 2 ) they expose birds ridiculously high concentrations inadequately tested chemicals . cheapest easiest feeder solution also happens closest chemical composition natural flower nectar : solution 3 or 4 parts water one part ordinary white sugar . if you want sugar dissolve faster , get additive-free superfine baking sugar . don't use honey , food coloring , kool-aid , jello , or any other junk - birds drink nectar just energy get everything else their bodies need eating insects	-1

when i bought this product , it said " new " ! however , upon opening package it arrived , cooker already opened inner box . i though perhaps someone just opened inner box check item before it sent ? i opened inner box , one " legs " cooker broken off rusted ! i needed use this right away so i not send it back . now i get this " leg " welded back ! beware " new " designation !	-1
price i paid i expected much more accuracy . data it downloads its external monitor pc terrible . even though unit synchronized atomic clock it still seems get dates wrong data it stores its database . it also problem accumulated rainfall . amount rainfall according database much higher what display shows accumulated amount . hourly 24 hour period also tend behave eratically . you might see inch rain last hour but when you come back later , last 24 hours shows only . 2 inches rain . strange . how you more rain last hour than last 24 ? seems backwards . good side , unit easy set up connects your pc existing ports cable provided . bad side , besides inaccurate , analysis software primitive difficult work . you better off downloading text file doing analysis excel . this unit also gives eratic readings temperature swinging up down up six degrees within twenty minute window . i wanted my son see how temps over 24 hour period form bell shaped curve . so much . this probably ok first time weather station my 8 year old but i would not recommend it any one else since this unit not cheap . one other thing , it only takes reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings hit miss . you could getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens read . i am dissapointed annoyed i spent money it not least semi-accurate . i tell you i it set up wireless . if you use enclosed hard wire connection option then you get more frequent readings maybe even better accuracy . good luck your homework first .	-1

one thing which mystifies me how few people embraced latest modern clock technology : radio controlled clocks which keep exact time automatically synchronizing themselves signals broadcast incredibly accurate u.s. atomic clock boulder colorado . such clocks not only always accurate fraction second , they also automatically set themselves daylight savings standard time appropriate . furthermore , such clocks typically quite reasonable price . yet while most americans , example , latest modern cordless phones cell phones , relatively few accuracy convenience radio controlled clocks . this model just one many styles sold amazon other vendors . try one i think you'll glad you . my wife i several these clocks throughout our house take accurate time granted , no what time system effect	1
this brush just awesome , good price boot ! works perfect my weber grill .	1
clock set itself right away during daytime it performed very well point . all i put battery it hang it wall facing general direction colorado i experienced no problems it then or now . i would advise anyone get one these clocks since they perform well accurate	1

i purchased 2 these clocks now . moment i inserted batteries clock started advancing stopped 4 ' o ' clock . i getting ready ship it back thinking it bad clock . but within 5 minutes both clocks received transmission corrected themselves exact time . so moral story don't return clocks without giving it some time it looks like these clocks stop 4 doesn't move all till it receives time	1
note : amazon description not include dimensions . package it recommends you measure first . it fits smokers 30 " ( 76cm ) across ( perhaps including handles , not sure ) 36 " ( 91cm)vertically . it bit big my standard-sized smoker ( 20 " across ) , so it unflattering its graceful curves , but good enough useful . it cheaply made , but looks like it suitable . i update my report if it falls apart use ( like reviewer said ) . it quite possible garbage bag would enough protect your grill . main advantage here it fits bit better , elastic close bottom bit . it probably looks bit better , if you care	1
keeps ribs searing . lower profile than most rib racks so it easier turn rib	1
i using this rack all summer still yet see it rust someone mentioned earlier review . rack certainly space saver comes handy when you lot grilling . i used it when smoking chicken ribs my weber kettle , noticed meat may tend touch when placed rack so not all areas may exposed smoke . if this happens , i may rotate pieces or just leave it like it since i'm not entering anything competition ! everything still same great taste but parts not exposed smoke different color .	1
i love this clock ! it big enough see all around back yard , looks great . keep mind they recommend keeping it sheltered extreme weather ... we ours under upper deck , so it sheltered rain . that extreme weather gets here los angeles	1
this grill great alternative expensive larger grills , perfect entry level weber apartment etc . only thing i think i dont care handle gets very hot so careful	1
we bought this use beach house , grills provided houses always dreadful . it worked perfectly grill shrimp , hamburgers hot dogs . it easy transport easy use very little assembly required	1
just make sure people don't make same mistake i , aware this not compatible weber 200 silver portable propane gas grill . amazon.com lists this rotisserie accessory weber 200 , so it amazon deserves low rating so i just given this current average 4 stars	1
it works new jersey , just wait night before you say something else	1
short it this clock performs its job quite admirably . you insert single aa battery then press one four buttons back tell it whether you eastern time , central time , mountain time , or pacific time . wait bit - mine received signal 3 minutes later , some people wait overnight . it receives radio signals colorado it readjust itself nightly keep near perfect time . it also factor daylight savings time . these it well - so it gets 5 stars because it what it supposed . however , if you live east coast , you must recognize you farther away radio source . this clock may not able set itself unless , example , placed near window . this not fault clock , but rather limitation radio waves . otherwise , clock seems well made , wood looks real , numbers easy read distance	1
like all weber products i owned , this brush excellent job	1
brush good job loosening grit grime your grill , but you still going break down wash grill soap water now then . brush strong wooden handle , leather loop , sturdy set bristles , grill scraper tough jobs . sure buy this longer brush 12-inch one not reach , especially larger grills	1

it radium so we see time dark during night without turning light	1
this great clock . looks good , makes no noise , very easy read . setup should simple , but i would suggest adding button change manual automatic . you usually don't get clock midnight you want setup it right beginning . since it not going able sync early afternoon , you want set time manually leave clock sync night . but this where additional button comes handy , cause moving hands same button its hard know if clock left automatic or not	1
we bought this clock replace one those cheap quartz wall clocks our new ( used ) motorhome . i wanted it so i would not wear watch but would still dependable accurate time piece . it took couple nights before lacrosse atomic clock received signal synch up , but after it seems working exactly advertised , accurate right second . this clock large protrudance back where clock works reside so bezel not sit flush wall . either large hole needs cut wall or you just live it . no big deal , but it something difficult see photos internet . this why i gave it 4 out 5 stars	1
cover exactly what i needed protect our smoker weather . it strong appears durable . i felt price fair this product	1
i using this rack all summer still yet see it rust someone mentioned earlier review . rack certainly space saver comes handy when you lot grilling . i used it when smoking chicken ribs my weber kettle , noticed meat may tend touch when placed rack so not all areas may exposed smoke . if this happens , i may rotate pieces or just leave it like it since i'm not entering anything competition ! everything still same great taste but parts not exposed smoke different color .	1

ok , i'm not freak , but i love grill i own least 5 weber grills . this one hands down best . i've using mine since 1993 it one own . buy this model today they redesigned it without stainless work area . it perfect cooking , smoking , grilling , etc . every thanksgiving i cook turkey grill it hit every time . also , leaves oven free other stuff . this mouth watering juicy turkey ... every time . burgers come out great . chicken . bbq . i've it all this grill it great . buy cover take care this ... it your favorite piece cookware you ever purchased . thanks weber ... it best	1
( husband writing review :) i use my lodge sportsman often possible , but sometimes it still go into storage while . this rugged cover custom fit , i appreciate how much cleaner my grill when i pull it out . keeps dust cobwebs minimum ; keeps rain out if you forget leave it outside . it well worth it if you're going invest grill .	1
i got this grill last year father day gift . i'd never smoked any meat my life but grill-man looong time . this smoker makes it easy . i've ribs , brisquet , pork steaks , chicken . all turned out great , brisquet especially ! make sure you cure inside grill before cooking anything it . there instructions box . also , if your model doesn't come built-in thermometer , make sure you order one char-broil website . using standard oven thermometer wastes time precious heat	1
i bought this grill set my fiance . he absolutely loved them . they heavy extremely sturdy . i would definitely recommend them !	1
my husband loved size , quality heavy weight this product . great male chef family	1
very well made product . i am extremely pleased . heck lot better than cheap cover i got ebay last year very deceptively advertised regarding it durability	1
highly recommed this grill cover . appearance/style classy it subtle colors work well backyard patio . it sooo durable ! i'm sure it last years . no more ugly black vinyl covers you punch holes first time you try drape them over grill . i'll never use anything else besides this artisan grill cover now !!	1
this new line grills everything you could ask grill . high btu output , large cooking surface good looking . i able maintain constant temperatures no problem all . i am very happy this descision	1
i've used my smoker 7 years now i nothing but great things say it . one recomendation drill small hole top insert metal stem thermometer ( $7 ) accurate monitoring smoking . you'll get best results when you hold temps desired levels . it also comes handy checking internal temps meat . after 7 years , heating element broke new ones $40 through char broil . i'm appalled they're so much , am contemplating buying smoker instead .	1
i recently purchased weber gold series grill wanted quality grilling tools complimented stainless steel design grill . i decided this spatula because quality normally associated weber name i not disappointed . spatula handle attractive rubber grip comfort . length spatula great reaching back grill large flanks fish . i would highly recommend this spatula anyone who searching quality accessory their weber grill !	1
it hard better than weber this grill not disappointed two years i owned it . i use it 3-4 times week cooked just everything you imagine it . i am very satisfied its performance , but it few minor flaws . i still my genesis series propane grill still fine after 12 years , but it not big enough so i moved up . pros : stainless doesn't rust . large enough cook substantial amount using indirect method . last night , i simultaneously grilled 4 t-bones , 10 skewers tequila-lime shrimp , sweet peppers , bread . that why i wanted this grill . i need room cook . insulated box holds heat well . first side burner i've actually works . assembly relatively easy . strong rotisserie motor . spin turkey or 3 chickens ; no problem . smoker box w/ its own burner great feature . stainless grates better than any others i used past . lots shelf space w/ fold-down shelves . battery-fired push button starters all burners easy reliable all weather conditions . cons : expensive . but i expect long service life . gas guzzler . more than one tank helpful . couldn't find cover fits it . but it stainless ... gas gauge doesn't work well , but no biggie . bottom cookbox warped little resulting grates loose shifting more than i'd like . occasion when cleaning grates , they fall into bottom cookbox . i work around this probably fix it without too much trouble , but it tick me off . this cost them my 5th star ; i expected better . so i pretty much love this grill it good thing , because i believe i'll it good long while . chad , weird chain door manually lighting grill . it match holder chain attached door so you won't lose it . go figure	1
i think this great product . first one lasted over year it runs 24/7 , even winter	1
i've watching silver while , thinking buy it amazon while it sale . but i finally decided get it local ace hardware store . here why : pirces not significant differrent amazon ace . but ace offered free assembly , free delivery , free gas refill . most important feature me : they allowed me upgrade it stainless steel cooking grates flavorizer bar only $20 extra . ( which $100 value amazon . ) regular grates flovorizer bar , you replace it couple years hard clean . but stainless steel type may last much longer easy maintain . so if you buy it amazon , you pay base price , plus shipping cost , self assembly , gas refill , upgraded cooking grates flavorizer bar etc . choice yours	1
this grill works great really survives elements . it looks brand new even after stormy winter our chicago balcony . i highly recommend it smaller places because shelves fold down out way when not use	1
i impressed looking this grill home depot , even more impressed price amazon.com . using grill , i discovered weber truly better than what i used past . food actually tastes better ! assembly took little longer than 30 minutes given instruction sheet . i little difficulty interpreting pictures , i feel some written instructions would beneficial	1
this sofa complete bargain . it stylish design comfortable . cushion firm supportive . colour texture all-weather wicker fantastic . it strong , standing up our kids , yet light easy move around . it arrived very promptly i'm delighted	1
yourself favor give yourself this gift- beautiful cover great grill . this absolutely nicest grill cover i've ever seen , i've paid 3 times this flimsy ones . i don't agree it too snug , it slipped right over no tugging , looks very neat tailored , but i don't like big billowy ones anyway . excellent deal , prompt shipping .	1
weber grill cover easy use . i would recommend this grill cover anyone wanting protect their weber grill . it fits grill very well easy clean .	1
this product exact replacement original grates . they great , however , if i it again , i could find one , i might gone upgraded quality grate	1
i thought these grates weren't good enough sears meat , boy i wrong . beautiful lines meats got me great reviews my guests . easy clean too	1
great price this unit . saw same one locally $159.00 not color wood i needed . followed directions works great . package new item advertised " nib " . amazon must gotten buy this wood color it cheaper than same units withdifferent wood	1
i bought this item based upon reviews i read i must say it lived up reviews . it job . i bought this late summer but one time i used it i impressed amount bugs it zapped short space time . i saw felt effectiveness product because i stayed backyard longer than usual	1
this my second bug zapper . took brand back didn't work . this zapper working great , that all thanks its intelligent design . some bug zappers super small entry holes , then wimpy little electrodes inside . this zapper designed let bugs fly easily , it vertical electrodes zap bugs . this zapper works really well ... fact other night it zapping like crazy because it hot bugs out . we live urban area near plant nursery , so we'd always bugs coming back door . now this zapper kills them attracts them away our backdoor . great product	1
reviewers who report grille doesn't get hot enough , slightest breeze blows flame out you should need stock up extra gas cannisters , i would point out : this review charcoal model !! once coals fully going mine , nothing short hurricane katrina could blow them out , proper amount charcoal loaded , you all heat you'll ever need . i nothing but praise mine . nice going , weber	1
we pleased our recent purchase . we surprised it came through us mail service . it broken part we believe used cord open umbrella .	1
bought this umbrella last week ( 9/23/05 ) amazon . initially hesitant purchasing it due other reviews describing issue pole two pieces , which , when connected , never straight . all i want add here i not experience this problem . screw mechanism which joins poles seems sturdy , pole appears perfectly straight . i wonder if other people bought umbrellas bad batch or manufacturer redesigned connection mechanism ? ( most recent reviews not mention this problem)re . overall quality , i can't speak how pole or umbrella itself wear over time , but least initially it looks good quality sturdy construction . one thing note despite product description picture making it look like pole made wood , it appears actually made some sort metal which wood coloured ( it still looks like wood though would not look out place wooden patio furniture ) . honest i actually prefer this , since i would imagine it won't discolour easily natural wood should longer lasting . summary , am very pleased my purchase - i would happily recommend it others looking good quality umbrella very reasonable price	1
we ordered umbrella replace one we many years . when product arrived , we surprised quality product such small price . we very satisfied	1
i heard this grill " only " 36000 btu , not hot some other grills . believe me , this puppy plenty hot if all you going cook food ! disregard this btu rating . this btu rating rubbish . this grill transfer so much heat your food so fast if you're not used cooking high-quality grill you turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol ( i used custom-cut 3-inch porter house break my new grill , my surprise , it closer well than i prefer , but still delicious ! ) everything high-quality . it much more solid than all other grills i looked , grill very even terms heating . besides , it beautiful . side burner not something i really interested , but i just went it . i used it first time . this grill you need	1
i love it ! it bit work maintain , but it awesome grill cooks everything ( once i figured out how cook got good grill cook book ) . i bought two propane cylinders just swap them out when gauge they hang says it quarter tank . it worth price	1
i like this rotisserie quality , ease use , functionality . rotisserie fits my weber performer grill ( which i also like lot ) perfectly , which no surprise since it made specifically weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill . spit nice chrome finish , forks , appears it last . this my first rotisserie unit , perhaps this might common knowledge , but after using it few times , i found using balancing weight works best first putting your bird or roast spit , then inserting loaded spit ring without weight tightened down or inserted motor , so spit may find its own balance , which naturally its heavy-side down . next , i tighten weight opposite this heavy side , insert it motor , turn it . i then play positioning weight relative spit , but remaining opposite heavy side , so it spins least amount strain motor . ( hope wasn't too wordy . ) anyway , i've cooked chickens , roast , 12 pound turkey ( hoping cook big honkin ' turkey soon ) , all great success . conjunction rotisserie , i've finally discovered canjun injector , hypodermic needle-like flavor injector . using both brings out juicy flavorful foods . one other tip ... carfully open keep box rotisserie came storage . i put some self-stick velcro box ends , it keeps this otherwise awkward store gizmo safe stack-able . i plan buy rotisserie unit my weber gas grill . i don't know why , but addition more succulent outcome food , seeing your food spin around fire adds anticipation meal	1
ring motor what they supposed . ring not fit very well , first , it able rock back forth . however , after little bending into shape , it fit more snug . way ring rests kettle , there alway some gap , which not allow good seal . i not only use this rotisserie , but also give me more room beer chicken . its worth getting it added flexibility .	1
this cover extremely heavy duty survived many windy thunderstorms still good new after year half . it still going strong , still good new	1
this pest repeller works great my attic repelling squirrels . squirrels broken three times gone within 15 minutes . i would not use this inside house because it make constant chirp sound . i can't hear this noise attic , so i buy when this wears out .	1
this solid body storage building exactly advertised . my goal store mower , trimmer , blower , gas miscellaneous items . i build shelf ( not included ) notch it fit install it before putting roof place . it works great gas miscellaneous items leaving room taller items but they must tilted some . if you mower retractable handles ( which i not ) it fit this building . ( so mower still out ) other than it cleared up mess back locks flammables up too . careful read instructions because it would very difficult take pieces apart after clicked into place . if you planning store mower i would recomend larger unit just ease use . this one great lot gardening supplies but i think they should provide least 2 or more shelves	1
protecting your grill important if you leave it outside all time . this far best grill cover we . it easy put over grill , velcro straps keep it flying off , it fits genesis s-320 perfectly , it heavyweight . recommended , definitely	1
i purchased this smoker last summer . assembly simple . one piece hardware missing , but no trouble replacing nut holds thermometer place . i replaced factory regulator adjustable unit get any level heat i desire . it sensitive wind though .	1
this sonic pest repeller works lot better than others . it keep away lot rodents decrease number spiders drastically . you start see less less spider webs it not make whole lot noise . i would define tally recommend this over other sonic pest repellers well worth money how much decrease insects creatures	1
this smoker works like charm ! only regret i it bit larger than i expected , i should bought next size down . other than times i used it results great . temperature easy control main concern i wanted sometime i didn't babysit while i smoking my ribs or pork shoulder . others complained receiving units damaged , i guess i lucky , there slight crease one corner but i able straighten it out easily . better packaging would improvement . my . 02 it well worth investment	1
down here southern mississippi you sit inside ac summer or hang hammock shade - but this my best one ever probably my last one since it so lightweight i prefer carry it out weather even though it so durable . i've several rope hammocks replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot beat . grandbaby loves it	1
i got this hammock back november , so i don't know if this hammock good summer , but it perfect hammock winter ! my fiance i could nap it all afternoon couple pillows blanket middle winter . it very comfortable even 2 people it . surface seems semi water resistance . we left it out rain few times most water stay top surface . we just turn hammock , dump out water , it dried under sun few hours . i read somewhere green stripes fade over time , but i live it	1
this bbq tool set absolutely top line , worth much more than i paid it ! all tools heavy wood rubber grips , heavy stainless steel . even case made hold up long time . i truly impressed when i received it	1
i'm new world smoking , ordered this when i dont feel like doing whole charcoal thing . it works fairly well flavor great , but not quite much you get using charcoal grill . i think it designed placed either side grill ... i've opted slide grates sides place smoker middle ... it seems less smoke escapes grill this way . worthwhile purchase	1
i always recommend oxo line tools anyone lot cooking wants something really designed use . this especially true anyone problems such tendonitis , arthritis , or carpal tunnel -- these tools all designed leverage energy efficiently instead wasting energy most poorly designed utensils . try them out	1
after assembling stand i very pleased my decision purchase this one . i also ordered extension , thinking my mayan family hammock i would need make it longer . but my surprise , hammock fit perfectly without extension , because height stand adjusted pretty high , you could put longer hammock it because this . very heavy steel , well enameled , excellent workmanship very easy assemble . ***** - definitely five star purchase	1
after college i moved back home few months before getting my own place . it totally sitcom setup i lived my mom basement - but mice spiders down there not funny all . i didn't really mind mice running around every now then , but when one got under covers me , i enough . i went local brick mortar store bought all kinds different traps , deterrents , etc try get them out or trap them without harming critters ( mom wouldn't it ) . i bought single two-pack these things immediately after i plugged first one , i saw two mice immediately come out their hiding spot scurry unfinished part basement . one my bedroom one bathroom basement enough me , but mom husband so impressed he bought dozen more rest basement ( lots separate rooms ) garage . definitely read tips suggestions - they only work if there large , open space so put this outlet " full view " room . each room need it own , very large room ( like two-bay garage ) need two or three . we put these up three years ago there hasn't mouse basement since	1

this little clock worked exceedingly well first . clear , large display bright enough read but not so bright it distracting night . it takes up little space night table , which great . however , if it your night table you'll angle it so clock face nearly toward wall , you can't adjust projection . if you face clock out toward far wall , projection diplayed upside down . still , i okay this , projection what i interested . worked great until it accidentally got knocked off nightstand onto carpet . one mishap projection broken . nothing could fix it ; you can't even open clock explore mechanics it . without projection , it simply procey bed-side alarm clock . it my fault knocking it over , but i would think clokc this caliber should bit sturdier	1

reference , " old tanks " refer this review weber " quick connect tanks . " first price : i got this home depot $16.95 because i needed grill hurry . if you not opd tank your weber grill see yourself future refilling , you would receive it time before you run out , then i would recommend getting it amazon lesser price but afford shipping time . if you older weber grill wanted tank refilled , then you probably understand frustration i go through get more propane . federal law mandated all tanks now " opd " certified . now , these opd tanks , which detected " star " shape handle , different opening where hose your grill needs connected compared older model . so when i went it refilled , they told me they could no longer refill my old model . so i bought blue rhino . then , i could not connect it my weber grill because different opening . ( propane hose would not adapt tank . ) so i now three options . one buy new grill , which would quite expensive . second , which weber recommended , probably because it would cost me more money , would buying new hose . ( they said it around $40 . i also heard it problem squirrels eating it . ) third this adapter i found . thus , this adapter answer price . connect thread side adapter your hose other side adapter ( this " spring side " or " quick connect " side where release hose adapter , you must just pull back end part adapter . ) picture adapter new tank old hose found here : http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/hdus/en_us/asset/images/eplus/161203_3.jpgi also some advice using product which i hope you may find useful . ( installation instructions quite weak product . ) when installing , there black plastic piece which used screw adapter part . careful when using your crescent wrench not break off part . if you break plastic piece , you probably unable take off adapter tank future . therefore , i would also recommend placing piece safe place so when you need refill , it handy take off adapter . however , if you lose piece , or break it , there one more way it refilled . there adapter which placed old tanks refilling . since this product basically converts your new tank into old one , then you place this refilling adapter product . i know it confusing words , but basically what i am saying you adapter adapter when refilling tank . your refill store most likely this second adapter you when you go refill . ( i get mine pool-mart they usually this handy . ) but just safe side , i would keep plastic piece . but back installation : when you finished screwing it , just connect your hose other side pulling back only part adapter moves , once you push hose end into adapter , push back up only part adapter moves lock hose place . remove hose , simply pull back sliding adapter piece - only part moves . but most likely you didn't need you refilled your old grill sometime last several years . but just case you may needed it . performance , there no leaks , shown soap water test . just pure gas grilling all i now until law passed . but until then , i recommend two things : first buying this adapter , second using common sense install it , not instructions . happy grilling , thanks reading	1

i lot searching review reading internet before finally deciding what buy . i am convinced quick draw ii best value available any make any conpany . features qdii generally found only much higher priced detectors . this thing really works advertised . i already found several coins other things right my own yard . it reliably indicate what coin detected although it many times confuses dimes pennies lcd readout . it very sensitive detects most coin size items very reliably 6 or 8 inches . auto notch discrimination works well filters out most trash items . i used metal detectors ended up aggravating frustrating . this one pleasure use quickly becoming relaxing profitable pastime me . if you want serious metal detector without spending whole lot money give it try ... you won't disappointed ..	1
our old general electric indoor/outdoor thermometer outdoor sensor broke this summer , so it time replace it weather station could give more info weather than just temp . i live south florida , it nice know what heat index , because summer , our temps coast rarely rise above 90 degrees , but heat index rarely below 100 ( which case i choose indoor treadmill over running outside ) . i bought this unit strength prior reviews , which i think pretty darn accurate their overall assessment . i can't present much new information here , but i validate some prior comments . weather station constructed cheap plastic . i think if this station falls off our kitchen bar , where it rests today , it break into smithereens . it'll best hung nail wall or put location where it not going fall ground -- ever . weather station clumsy vertical design small base so i think it'd pretty easy bump into it knock it over . same advice above paragraph applies here , too . weather station emit high-pitched tone when you press button backlight display few seconds . it not big deal me , but some might find annoying . weather station clutzy , non-intuitive method setting display which really call pressing set button up 11 times ! each depression set button selects one area display set , there lot settings displayed ( time , day , date , etc . ) . it pretty easy spend moment setting weather station ( despite clutzy interface ) , because i live eastern time zone , my job made easier because default setting eastern time zone . clock automatically synchronized some atomic clock somewhere , so part worked just fine . accuracy , well , i've it only few days now , but it seems working alright . we've rain last few days , barometric display -- which only shows clouds/rain , partly sunny , sunny -- accurately forecasted cold front drop air pressure . when i put outdoor sensor next indoor sensor ( inside my house ) , readings within few tenths degree each other . humidity readings exactly same . weather station reads . 3 . 7 degrees warmer than my old indoor/outdoor thermometer . i wouldn't know which two digital displays accurate -- my old thermometer or this new weather station . weather station seem lot more jumpy when it comes reading indoor temp . it quick ( when compared my old indoor thermometer ) change reading when , say , air conditioning turns . lunar phase display nice touch . overall , i like this unit so far . i wish it constructed more durable plastic -- my old ge indoor/outdoor unit built thrown against wall without damaged -- i think i'd prefer thermometer reading wasn't quick so jumpy temperature fluctuations . i like humidity readings both indoor outdoor , i especially like heat index calculation . all , i would recommmend this weather station other buyers	1

this my first charcoal grill i say , i bought it because weber reputation so many years best charcoal grill . mentioned , it isn't very big indirect cooking . i cook just my wife me it fine but too small cooking guests . if i could it over again , i'd buy 22 1/2 " grill because it larger cooking area ability add rotisserie attachment . i'm not big rotisserie guy but extention needed cook beer chicken , something i always loved cook gas grills .	1
choosing our first grill really simple decision . we knew we wanted something quality would last us while . weber only way go our minds . now we own this grill i honestly say hardly day goes we don't use it!i'm really glad we opted one touch rather than smokey joe same manufacturer . this grill hook inside cover hang side ash clean up very easy . two us , this grill enough keep us or even guests well entertained . highly recommended	1

this unit easy load , easy maintain temperature , simply cooks best barbeque . i not seen any other wood or charcoal smoker compare , dollar dollar . you complete control over how smokey flavor ( or isn't ) . i only check temp once every hour . i 5 full racks ribs ( ribrack ) , not quot ; babybacksquot ; either , plus 2 pork shoulders once , could fit more ! use all charcoal , all wood , or any combination . i also use charwood because it burns so clean . i recommend ordering optional thermometer which fits built-in opening right hand side big door . holds up 100 lbs meat ! drippings drain lower right . firebox easy clean , i use garden trowel . tomorrow i'm doing 2 racks ribs , 10 lbs . chicken wings , corn cob ... i love it !!!!	1
i've this grill almost year now no reliability problems it . i purchased mine lowe . grill very good flame/temperature control side burner excellent . i grill it seven days week through summer months warm weekends fall . heat pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots . side burner nice since it comes non stick coated griddle cooking . i actually used this feature late fall during power outage cook eggs french toast breakfast . side burner without griddle cast iron pot holder . lid side burner large enough you close it when using smaller pots . very useful windy or chilly days . overall i am extremely pleased this grill i no rust or wearing issues it . only drawback grill design ignitor only works far left burner . it lights 3 burners left right . so if your only using 1 burner quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers 2 people you need always use left burner	1

we bought this fireplace we love it ! big enough crowd 10 or more people lawn chairs sitting around enjoying it ( we family picnic everyone commented how nice it ) . small enough storage our small shed winter . directions putting it together bit confusing ( per my husband ) . ours also came additional piece allow outdoor cooking fireplace ( we haven't used it yet ) . ours also came cover put over it when not use which perfect keeping water out it . great buy !! we use it frequently ! highly recommend it .	1
this clock very easy set up ... pop battery within 5 minutes it sets itself . it large face numbers easy read distance , making it perfect business use . it only few dollars more than clock no automatic time setting , so it worth it me least one clock i'll only check when battery wears down	1
this unit harder set up than others i , however price options it great buy	1
i little reluctant purchase these because i heard lot things spring mechanism them faulty but they recalled fixed . so i wondering if one i bought fixed model or not . well , it must newer design because i've using these few months i nothing but good things say them . i previously using long oxo set tongs which pretty good but little flimsy some heftier cuts meat like , whole chickens pork shoulders . these tongs sturdy ! you know minute you pick them up feel weight them . they easily pick up anything you need grill , because 20 inch length , you keep you hand safe distance actual fire . handle grooves your fingers thumbs which enhances grip they lock closed position storage . if you any outdoor cooking , you appreciate these tongs . they're well thought out piece equipment you'll use years glad you purchased	1
this great portable grill size . 14 " one would fine 1-2 people , but not more . this grill handle more charcoal enough room allow 2 heat zones . hardest part finding one ! i finally found one ebay but , you better hurry !	1
though this portable grill , it terrific home use if you're single , or small balcony apartment . it takes very little space , easy maneuver when cleaning time comes . we took ours picnic this weekend grilled two packs hot-dogs once ( 16 thick dogs ) . because grill small , things get hot quick , you need careful easy burn foods should take longer cook . burgers well , steaks fantastic . chicken needs watchful eye . i've used this gem years . my apartments , whole , mandated simplicity efficiency offered up smokey joe . great feature rounded top . this enables better smoking , air smoke circulates more fluidly . downsides : legs aren't sturdy they could . given time , bit bumping around general abuse , screwed legs might turn askew . if you notice this while grill hot , you've problem . solution keep them tight during nonuse . air intake bottom gets clogged ashes . key good charcoal grilling manipulation air flow . intake might open , but stopped up . if you diligent clean ashes , you'll ok . because grill so close ground , you need careful . unlike most weber grill , this one also apt getting kicked over , run into dogs , cars children . i fully recommend weber smokey joe . now , i'm hungry . time stir coals pop few brats . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co	1

first all let me say there some reviews you should ignore , such one here says easygreen sprouter not quality piece equipment ! i'm very fussy consumer i honestly say this outstanding unit very high high quality . you also some google searches you find nothing but raves it what high quality it . worth every penny ! secondly , i'm starting believe everone should grow sprouts get vitamins we not getting food our grocery stores . far " produce " goes our grocery stores , you may well eat boxes they shipped ! over over media these days we hearing them say our soils so depleted first place time we get veggies fruits our grocery bags they lost what little nutritional value they ! even organic stuff questionable time it gets our table , let alone fact some organic farmers not really following practices produce nutritional food . they may not using poisonous sprays but they replentishing soil ? ok- enough ! you find tons info your own . if you want something fantastic yourself your family buy one these sprouters start getting nutrition your body begs you ! ( no i don't work them but wish i designed it ! ) this incredible addition world nutrition heck lot cheaper than buying expensive vitamins your body can't absorb very well . we spent thousands vitamins over years . who really knows what them anyway ? you'll know exactly what your sprouts though . they alive packed everything vitamin pill wished it could but can't!! it so so easy you won't even believe it . it fun ! sprouts outstanding cleanest most vitamin packed foods you ever put your mouth . load up sandwich or toss up salad or throw some smoothie . don't forget brocolli sprouts great !! i use half dropper full 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide each time i fill it water every day . ( one gallon ) this perfectly safe actually helps oxiginate sprouts well prevent mold . i so impressed my easygreen sprouter i ordered three more these ( actually called easygrass sprouters ) purchased wheatgrass juicer so i grow wheatgrass , miracle food . ( check out ann wigmore " sprout book " her book wheatgrass ) i can't say enough easygreen sprouter !! apparently people all over world catching this " fountain youth " piece incredible equipment ! some googling see yourself !	1
i bought this clock specifically time projected ceiling night . my wife i recently got new alarm clocks use backlit lcd rather than led numbers , we found we hard time reading them night . we bought this clock solution . my 4 star rating based use alone . it simply not work during daytime- projector not bright enough complete daylight or bright room lights . that good- light bright enough seen during day would far too bright nigh t-t ime use . you disappointed if you want use this thing during day . i would given this clock much lower rating if i intended use " atomic clock " feature , or use it alarm clock . specifically : 1 . atomic clock only works certain parts country . atomic clock broadcasting station denver , co , further away you get denver , less likely you pick it up . we east coast , our house eastern side large hill , this clock never picked up atomic clock signal , despite following instructions meticulously . while it possible we defective unit , based what i've read i just think we're bad spot , this unit doesn't very good antenna . good news internal clock seems keep fine time . 2 . physical construction very , very cheap . it extremely lightweight , easy knock over . power cord connection flimsy , moving clock ( or knocking it over ) result loss power ( your configuration if you don't batteries installed ) . buttons especially cheap , poorly organized . it works fine our use because we don't need touch it , but it would terrible daily alarm clock- unless you lot more patient than i am bedtime , you would not want try set this thing sleepy state mind . unless you lot more coordinated than i am immediately after waking up , you would knock it off nightstand regularly just trying shut it off . it wouldn't stand up long such abuse . but , i said earlier- if all you need put time ceiling , it works admirably . * update * : after using this thing 3 months , it spontaneously picked up atomic clock signal . i no idea why ( we didn't change * anything *) , but it locked couple weeks . -	1

i like oregon scientific products , but their previous atomic alarms quirky controls -- often leading changing time zone middle night rather than turning off alarm . this one lots better ! projection feature works ok , though doesn't really focus sharply close distances i'd prefer use . eight minute snooze alarm great -- just right interval ! overall , nice , useful , moderately expensive alarm clock	1

i weber silver grill several years . grill great , but steel flavorizor bars rust replaced ( i replaced my bars twice five years ) . i just started using ss bars , but i am sure they better than old bars , well worth extra initial cost . if i able get ss bars earlier ( not usually available local markets ) , i probably would not replace bars i ( twice ) . i highly recommend spending extra dollars ss bars when originals fall apart	1

i ordered this clock , then send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged ( actually , minimally damaged ) . first two times glass cracked broken . third time , all matter minor dent marks metal frame where packaging must pressed down it ( this only noticeable certain light angles ) . shipping problems weren't manufacturers fault though , amazon packing shipping . it'd nice if they maybe put big " don't stack things top this box " sticker or something box so it didn't get damaged . or , bubble wrap , remember stuff ?! those airbags just ain't cuttin ' it . clock itself , i love it . i kept it despite minor denting b/c it discontinued manufacturer , it largest atomic clock i could find didn't some ugly antique-ish design . second hand actually ticks , instead fluidly moving , which nice touch . it easy set up , it big easy read . it reminds clocks all over my high school ( good way ) . all all , very happy actual clock , very dissatisfied w/ amazon shipping packing it	1
this clock works great ! it automatically picks up accurate time through radiowave . it not come product manual but easy figure out . all you selct your time zone button ( pt , mt , ct , et ) put new aa battery . i agree review which mentioned this clock not made durable construction . matter fact , when i picked up clock package , tiny screw came off . it one screws hold back body panel main body . it not affected function well visual part , anyway , so it may not big deal . overall , this clock good enough price	1
all you put batteries wait hour your clock proper time forever ! no climbing reset it daylight savings .	1

i've using metal detectors around 5 years now . my first detector bounty hunter quickdraw ii , very fine , easy learn detector that real workhorse . i learned most everything i know metal detecting personal experience reading lots posts asking lots questions bounty hunter forum http://www.detecting.com i shopped around found bounty hunter land ranger factory shipped model ( no extras except 4 " 8 " coil ) $337 . price , i couldn't afford not buy it ! when land ranger ( lr ) arrived , it 3 pieces extremely easy assemble . manual comes lr gives you basic information you need get started detecting lr , but bit general when it comes explaining what each functions . if you just want " turn go " detector , land ranger may not you . if this case , i would recommend getting easier learn detector such bounty hunter quickdraw ii or even bounty hunter tracker iv . should you later decide get land ranger , your first detector make excellent back-up detector great detector friend or family use you . what i would recommend going bounty hunter forum website listed above learn , way more , information various detectors their various functions than i could ever begin explain here . even though i detecting while , my first trip out land ranger quite overwhelming somewhat frustrating due much greater sensitivity this model , added features it information overload tones responding mineralized ground conditions , trashy areas ( many pulltabs , screwcaps etc . ) condition know " falsing " ( tones due mostly incorrect " sensitivity " settings improper ground balancing ) . initial experience i describe here very common first time land ranger users frustrating , but get much better practice more one learns detecting general land ranger particular . i use land ranger now , i learned much settings , what ignore what watch indicate which targets may worth digging . once past information overload ( happen , i assure you ) , user begin appreciate sensitivity this detector , learn proper settings , begin finding more more valuable items ( or targets they called ) become one this detector . i purchased bounty hunter land ranger it very sophisticated microprocessor features including - target id , vdi ( numeric ) readout indicating target conductivity , 3 tone id , it automatic manual ground balancing , programmable target accept/ reject , all metals , no motion/ pinpoint mode , self tuning ( motion ) all metals mode ( good deep hunting relics , caches and/or gold nugget shooting ) ... ... reputation bounty hunter detectors ... but mainly excellent price such full featured , professional metal detector . i love able put this baby work discriminating out trash items while ringing sharp clear when locating coins jewelry . land ranger also ideal hunting relics ( gold ) nugget shooting , although i not much either these yet ( soon , i hope ) . i also love fact two coils ( standard 8 " 4 " nugget coil ) come stock land ranger i also 10 " coil i purchased around $60 . ( it important several coil sizes available various types hunting ) price additional coils many other brands detectors astronomical , so this integral part my decision get bounty hunter rather than some other brands . i love how lightweight this detector . i love knowing i sophisticated detector not miss items buried deep . ( how deep depends size object , type metal , soil conditions etc ) generally , lr detect depth around 10 " -12 " deep coin sized target . ( believe me , you won't want dig too many objects deep , most targets right around 4 " -6 " deep , due how coins , jewelry etc . tend migrate down into soil , this varies , course , but general , greater number objects somewhere this depth range . what i hate land ranger parts manual give very general description certain features like ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode . i wish land ranger waterproof or least water resistant ... it not , i highly recommend you not use it rain without good plastic cover fits securely around control housing . conclusion : i highly recommend land ranger any seasoned detectorist ... or novice detectorist willing devote good deal time fair amount patience mastering many nuances this full featured detector . land ranger hosts target id , ( vdi ) numeric readout , 3 tone id , depth meter , battery meter , ground monitor meter , sensitivity meter target indicator . it touchpad controls sensitivity , accept/ reject discrimination , all metals - no motion/ pinpoint mode , 3 factory preset modes , all metals ( motion ) self tuning mode smart trac automatic manual ground balancing . it handful , but great full featured unit very reasonable price . 5 stars ... highly recommended if you willing devote some time patience learning it traits harnessing it potential , once you , you'll absolutely love it , i know i ! recommendedyes	1

weber grill always cadilac bbq grilling . it quality good - it won't rust last decade even when left outdoors . its other claim fame ability it offers " shut off charcoal " it air tight . " one touch " system just makes it even easier . instead close three bottom vents seperately ( fumbling hot surfaces cannot easily seen ) , you just flip one lever . you make up your mind yourself silver vs . gold models both good . what size you need ? what you want cook ? turkey ? - better get 22 1/2 inch size . if you chicken or roast mind , 18 1/2 inch it save you some fuel boot	1
this works very well chicken ribs well	1

item showed up nearly week before i expecting it . due its weight , free shipping added plus . delivery company actually placed grill inside my garage which very helpful again due its weight size boxes . directions provided assemble grill vague very difficult interupt . directions indicated plan 30 40 minutes assemble . it took almost 2 hours i am very mechanically inclined . once assembled grill worked perfectly . if i it over again , i would buy this grill , but would love better directions	1

very nice product but smaller than i thought it would . wish write up dimensions i unsure size . would liked it bigger .	1
i bought ( apparently identical ) charbroil lowe my son , because it rated so highly consumer . i opportunity cook it twice , very impressed -- very even ; very controllable . so , i bought one myself amazon , am still impressed . i think reviewer who commented bad packing may received received return . packing mine good , everything plastic bagged ; no scratches , finish looked ok . assembly not light-hearted , but biggest problem assembly instruction sheet . not very clear , uses " beside " where it should say " inside " ; makes no mention until 3/4 way through there different lengths screw , not differentiate regular sheet metal screws . however , i no real problem , but assembly take 1 1/2 - 2 hours . i thought construction quite good . certainly nothing much stronger or heavier than it needs , but this means grill no heavier than it needs ! when assembled everything feels very solid . i take wheels off reinstall them after completing frame so i could tighten all screws when frame fully assembled squared . probably not necessary , but it only added 30 seconds . next time i would delay installing wheels few steps . i give five stars because i not know grill this price range large , so many features , cooks so well	1
i 4 more atomic clocks ( 2 more analogue 2 digital ones ) well 3 atomic watches . self setting function works exactly same all them . so i think it worth setting expectations straight how this clock most likely work you . unless you live close colorado ( where time signal originates ) proper way ' setting ' this clock put battery wait overnight clock set itself . best signal reception depends where you live also time year weather conditions . charlotte , nc where i live - most my atomic clocks watches sync themselves around 2 am . i guess it bit confusing people unfamiliar ' atomic ' technology see hands clock start moving around then stopping some random hour if though clock broken ... la crosse ( other makers ) should probably include ' quick start ' card states big bold letters put battery , select your time zone , ignore any hand movement ( or lack there ) then wait overnight . again - unless you live close enough co so clock receive time signal any time day or night - you wait until next day . i've this clock around 6 months now it worked perfectly well ( within 1 second actual time ) exception couple bizarre quirks . one time clock got itself off 15 minutes ( though seconds hand dead ) . i not adjust it - next day it fixed itself through its usual overnight self-setting . time it spontaneously changed time zones started showing california time . this time around i remove battery , reinsert it re-select time zone ( simply re-selecting time zone not solve problem ) . reviewer remarked - clock looks nicer ' person ' than it photos . very thin rim makes dial look bit bigger than stated dimensions would suggest . face color off-white or very light cream looks very nice . build quality - it nothing special . clock 100% plastic ( even ' crystal ' ) except dial which simply paper . whole thing - including mechanism - made china . even though clock probably extremely cheap manufacture ( given its all plastic construction ) it not look ' cheap ' once it hangs wall . i bought virtually identical quality atomic clock seven bux ( delivered ) everybody favorite auction site it looks ok - but not nice this one ( different ' brand ' - not la crosse ) . one star taken off ' quirks ' - but not ' good enough ' materials engineering ( it would better if it made less cheaply - but it looks fine way it ) . michae	1

i like this clock . this night stand alarm clock . it what it supposed very well once it set up . set up not intuitive so you read manual exactly it says . but it not really hard set up it just not easy . you think what you doing . way manual large reviewer commented but it because instructions several languages not because it so complicated . reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead 5 stars plug which ac adapter plugs into , which allows it project time continually , too much space either side . result you think ac adapter plugged up properly when fact adapter gone down either side plug . it took me while figure out what going . first i thought clock defective some other reviewers . that bad design flaw needs fixed . fyi it doesn't project time continually battery mode because would quickly drain batteries . battery mode it only projects time 3 or 4 seconds when you press snooze button . once clock set up your time zone you never set time again , not even daylight savings time , you always correct time . clock built antenna picks up radio signal official u . . government time keeper . once day it sets itself according radio signal . it also sensors tell you indoor humidity temperature .	1

but ... it ideal us ... we going get mosquito magnet ( which lots our family/friends/etc ... ) , but then saw not only you spend money up front but buy all kinds things years keep it going ... so we figured we would start this then if it didn't work we would move ... love technology description website this etc ... when we hooked it up it seemed work instantly ... who knows weather didn't change or different soap we using , etc ..??? but one night we sitting getting eaten alive mosquitoes next we plugged it we weren't .... so .... we weren't going unplug it find out ! esp . our three little kids protect them ! it would 5 if we never got bitten	1

first thing i noticed big kahuna quality construction . after simple assembly process taking 10 minutes ; i fired it up amazed how powereful burner . average home stove burners produce 9,000 14,000 btus -- big boy produces up 65,000 btus ( according eastman ) . if doesn't get your wok turn red hot then nothing short jet engine . subject woks ; i didn't buy one eastman i'm glad i didn't . i'm sure eastman woks top quality but i very good reason my statement . lodge makes iron wok not only less expensive but also fits into big kanuna like key lock ( minor modifications burner rack ) . base lodge pro-logic 14-inch cast-iron wok loop handles not only works great big kahuna but it also sits nicely your stove thanks it flat bottom . ok , world isn't perfect so lodge wok didn't fit into big kahuna grill out box . order make it fit , i filed down four cross members grill 1/8 " each side now it fits like glove . this huge advantage over curved bottom wok because wok simply can't move much safer use ( considering high temperature cooking surfaces this big plus ) . let face it : nobody wants hold their wok place while cooking if this avoided . i also recommend you get eastman stainless wok spatula ( also amazon ) -- it almost requiremen t.t he only thing i would change big kahuna would add electronic ignition . i'll probably add one myself using outdoor grill parts . keep mind big kahuna , wok spatula lodge wok all available amazon which means free super-saver shipping available amazon -- resulting considerable savings these heavy items . you could easily pay twice much elsewhere .	1
this works well . easy use quite affordable . it would perfect if it clock well , but temperature humidity readings it works great	1

this unit works well . 90 foot max range direct line sight . walls obstructions reduce this distance significantly . oregon scientific makes number main units remote sensors . they not all work together . check their web site which remotes work which main units before you buy : http://www2.oregonscientific.com/service/sensors/default.asp .	1
this nice addition anyone patio . product came very well packaged heavy duty double boxes legs wrapped padded paper . assembly took around 30 minutes . others commented holes don't line up naturally require some " finessing " order get lined up , but really wasn't difficult overcome . all required assembly 4mm allen wrench which provided ( although end started get worn 1/2 way through assembly required me use wrench ) . probably one nicest features table adjustable levelers legs . this seems like good quality i am confident last many years come	1
when researching metal detectors before buying bounty hunter tracker iv christmas gift , i learned using earphones detector not only makes hearing " beeps " much easier , but also extends battery life battery detector . we live windy , windy canyon area , so i knew earphones necessity because constant wind noise . my husband says earphones effectively screen out noise would overpower emissions detector if he weren't wearing headset . he happy camper his bounty hunter tracker iv bounty hunter stereo earphones	1

well , i ordered this online we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally . it lasted exactly two weeks . problem extremely weak design : 14oz glass feeder fairly heavy-too heavy stay attached any glass two measly suction cups , this . there somewhat strange instructions this model , directing user quot ; rubquot ; suction cups several minutes order ( supposedly ) build up proper quot ; suctionquot ; -then glass slides into groove ; well , thing worked first-until i slide out glass bottle portion refill it . i it gingerly i could , not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups , refilled it(only halfway ! )-and replaced it . 4 minutes went by-and then entire thing-glass , suction cups , everything-fell our deck , breaking into million thick glass shards ... frustrating me , hummers-and our two dogs , banished outside until i could clean up this mess . what crummy product ! overpriced-although i wouldn't buy it again two cents . beware	-1

this grill it all , six burners , side burner , rotisserie infrared burner smoker box dedicated burner . grill grates 3/8 " stainless steel rods provide great grill marks your food . grill heats up 600 degrees less than 10 minutes , but it burn through propane rather quickly , but wouldn't any different any 60,000 btu grill . i able put grill together myself little over hour . fit pieces fantastic end result attractive incredibly stable grill . it two pull-up counters stainless steel inserts , cabinet stainless doors . so far i made countless steaks , dogs chicken breasts all came out same due even temperature grill . my old charbroil would give me two raw breasts , two good breasts , two overcooked breasts ... not this grill . i also slowed cooked some ribs smoker box going meat fell off bone . but , best meal yet rotisserie chicken i prepared rub injected marinade . skin crispy meat tender juicy . we'll making many more those chickens future . weber known commodity . they built last , given quality components ( care ) i expect this grill last least 15 years . many people end up get rid their weber after 10 , 12 , 15 years because cart rusted out , but that not issue this grill cart constructed 304 stainless steel . all all , great grill last long time . my only cons would propane consumption maybe size . it probably little too big me my family , but it only weber all features i wanted ( mainly rotisserie smoker box burner ) . if they four burner model those options i would gotten , but alas weber summit platinum d4 not exist	1

i've using stainless steel weber grates few weeks now , replaced old porcelain ones . i think heating quicker , more event , perhaps even more absorbing items grill . not sure if makes sense , but it seems foods seem heat through adequately shorter amount time without getting overcooked . i tend keep burners down low turn cover down almost everything i cook . i'm little disappointed grates don't stay shiny stainless steel , even areas which i don't lay down foods . i guess that because all heat swirling around when i cover closed . all all , i give this hearty recommendation	1

i am amazed . my mom sent this me after i'd complained already eaten alive mosquitos this year . i don't just get bites ; i get huge , oddly shaped , so-itchy-they're-almost-painful , welts . i am person who attracts every single biting insect . i often wished i sweated deet . however , i don't . i tried this dubiously , first morning--i'd getting bites every day 8 10am ( even high % deet ) . -- no bites . -- i still didn't believe it . i used it again evening -- after rainstorm come through -- 6pm 10pm . no bites ! it comes belt clip , but i left it outside one point when i came inside . second i left its side , mosquito landed me . i , since then , used it several more times , no insect spray all , it very muggy around here . absolutely no bites . i seen couple more bees than usual , it turns out ingredient this blows out ( geraniol ) said attract bees . not big deal me . it apparently doesn't work everyone . i always assumed there some sort chemical i give off makes mosquitos head straight me , bypassing everyone else . ( i might party where no one else even sees mosquito i leave over dozen bites . ) i wonder if geraniol somehow combines whatever it i put out neutralizes it . this could explain why it would work some people not other people . this price , it worth it find out if you one people whom it might work ! i figure if i replace cartridge every 2 weeks ( ~ $3.50 /cartridge ) , i even saving money because i'd going through 1-2 cans high-deet bug spray per week	1
while principle product rather simple ( flat piece metal spikes sticking up ) , it very useful . instructions very easy - coat light coating oil , drop potatoes metal spikes . stick bbq cook . allegedly cooks faster than potatoes would oven . here my reflections after my first time using this contraption : 1 ) i started cooking potatoes same time steak vegetables . time my steak asparagus cooked , potatoes needed 10 minutes or so . hindsight , i should started potatoes while grill heating up ; they would time2 ) i varied original instructions - wrapping two four potatoes aluminum foil before placing them spikes . they cooked faster , though less roasted taste ( i found very desirable ! )3 ) one four spikes i placed sweet potato - which tasted fantastic after coming off grill ! it needed no foil , cooked little faster than exposed ( foil-free ) potatoes . summary , you should probably start cooking potatoes while grill heating up . you wrap them foil make job faster ; though it cut back nice roasted flavor you otherwise get . i gave it 4 stars because it isn't 100% non-stick , even coat oil . when i pull potatoes off rack , they tend stick spike tear part potato open . still taste great , though	1
i received cover , it fits just picture indicates , it comes down wheel . i leave charcoal underneath mine , haven't any problems rain soaking it . cover heavy-duty seems very good quality . i'm pleased my purchase	1
i can't complain durability these sensors . i bought original la crosse weather station 5 years ago while located texas . it recorded temperatures high 113 degrees since i moved nj 2.5 years ago , it also recorded low 18 below . i'd say that pretty durable unit so no qualms buying replacement when original one quit recording humidity bounced around temperature readings within short timeframes . i'm back working now i this unit ... i can't live without my weather station la crosse nice looking works	1
i recently purchased this model replace separate radio controlled atomic clock wired in/out thermometer . unit seems well made display easy read . based upon my experience so far i would still buy one but design/implementation could certainly improved . 1 - remote distance 80 ' line sight under perfect conditions . manual suggests deduct 20-30 feet external wall . if there wasn't external wall it wouldn't outdoors now would it ? 2 - time day only updated once day at/near midnight . my unit off 2 seconds noon . not big deal but one would expect bit more accuracy . 3 - algorithyms computing sunrise/sunset moonrise/moonset seem off couple minutes when compared values intellicast , etc . 4 - temperatures humidities seem accurate compared other measurements i . 5 - even though it ' rain cap ' external sensor must out direct rain fall such under eaves . 6 - oak trim just vinyl decal plastic . nobody going confuse it real wood . however , spite my criticisms i think it good unit approximate weather monitoring	1

after experiencing same thing many here witnessed ( after 8 hours smoker didn't get hot enough , i finish my meat oven ) , i decided ask char-broil support their website what i remedy situation . their answer , i quote , " thank you your response . purchase replacement parts , please contact grill lover 1-800-241-8981 24 hours day 7 days week place order . we apologize inconvenience . if you any further questions or concerns , please let us know .

sorry say it , i've liked oregon scientific products past , but this junker . two chief problems . first it doesn't know how switch over daylight savings time correctly . i understand switch-over dates changed this year , but this more recent model clock , older rm826a no trouble this year . i got up hour late first daylight savings time sunday march . sadly , even if you manually set rm323a correct time , it reset overnight wrong time . only way fix this ( per oregon scientific web site ) turn off radio connection atomic clock , thereby defeating reason owning this clock first place . ( fairness , o-s says it work fine after april 1 , but what future years when dates change around ? my guess same problem . ) second problem it very difficult use , including such basic stuff setting alarm . granted , oregon scientific clocks don't lot buttons , so it little complicated handle all functions . but this particular clock both " single alarm " " weekly alarm " goes off every day same time , selecting which one , setting alarm time , even just turning off alarm anything but obvious . i suppose world time capability could useful some folks , but i find this clock worse every respect than rm826a , which no longer manufactured . i'm going toss this one trash find couple rm826a before they're no longer available . oregon scientific no more stock couple days ago	-1

this great clock . looks good , makes no noise , very easy read . setup should simple , but i would suggest adding button change manual automatic . you usually don't get clock midnight you want setup it right beginning . since it not going able sync early afternoon , you want set time manually leave clock sync night . but this where additional button comes handy , cause moving hands same button its hard know if clock left automatic or not	1

weber seems stopped producing this awesome grill . i'm so very disappointed this great grill discontinued . smaller 14 " smokey joe simply not depth charcoal grate cooking grate hold enough layers charcoal reach consistent high heat . this only portable charcoal grill it . if you want portable grill that actually useful , this size must . i tried them all . smaller grills cannot retain consistent high heat , you forget heating zones , indirect grilling smaller portable grills . what weber may not understand many people need good portable grill . city chicago , example , forbid any charcoal grill porch . so we no choice but carrry grill outside . not mention big picnics , outdoor trips , parties park ... small grills just doesn't it . there no open ash tray , meaning you just shut vents , snap grill shut ( whatever there ) wait 45 minutes , grill cool touch ready sit car - no worries ash coming out it . charcoal reused next time . it awesome . i tried other brand portable big grills , design so horrible , hard clean , doesn't retain heat , etc . just makes me miss this grill even more . i finally got this grill back after letting my friends use it couple years . that two years abuse it still looks shinny . i've missed this grill every summer since i parted it , i don't think i'll part it ever again	1
