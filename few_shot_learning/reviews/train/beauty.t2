i saw jonathan qvc really impressed claim moisturizing conditioner great dry/damaged hair . he also said his products don't strip color out hair like some brands market . i color highlight my hair wanted something would protect it . what disapointment . conditioner bottle horrible dispensing even small amount conditioner . i remove lid . then , it like paste ... doesn't seem go through hair .. even after 3 minutes . when i tried comb my hair out , it like birds nest . i put spray leave conditioner , line , my hair just comb through it . i ordered it qvc ... it going back	1
scale 1 5 , packaging gets negative 1 . you can't sqeeze conditioner out bottle , ended up removing top . value product , jonathan gets 1 . quality product 3 . conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter . need use more than average . conditioner average detangling after using it four times it condition your hair , but no better than other quality brands . i like it seems cut down drying time , but bed head similar product that out while . option i would rather choose bed head quality price	1
unless you new softball glove break , this product not you . way , way too much oil . just nappy . i might well put mayo my hair .	-1
this hairspray too wet too stiff . it ruined my clean , freshly washed hair made my blonde locks stiff darker - yuck !!!! i love voluminizing shampoo conditioner well voluminizing foam - but when i lightly sprayed " finishing " hair spray- it ruined everything . i stick areosol hairspray instread pump . sorry jonathan :	-1
watching show i thought jonathan really cared hair its no doubt he still but his shampoo leaves alot desired . example , even hot , very humid atmosphere houston , tx it left my hair feeling dry unhealthy , even after using his conditioner ( alot it ) . my hair looks awful after using it . bottle claims it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it use three different types peg , petroleum based thicker found most bath products erode wooden tables just minutes . this just harmful mea , especially people sensitive scalps hair . it claims not strip your hair but products supposed cleanse much less apparent product than peg products . since peg thickener , you're also getting diluted , toxic , solution . even though head shoulders uses mea i find even works better than this . my hair doesn't feel like it any more its essential oils i've switched back other hair products iv'e using . it not worth your 20 dollars , its barely worth 5 dollars . my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration . don't buy it !	-1
i see several previous reviews acknowledge fact this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like " straw " yet say because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean ! you kidding me ? if " clean " hair means my hair feel like straw it literally feel like straw , then i'll happily return " dirty " hair ... seriously , i've smoother , softer hair drugstore shampoos cost . 99 than this 20 dollar shampoo conditioner ! i could not even run comb through my hair while it wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough ! i rather dry hair , i merely tried this product lark , just see if it any good because i am fan jonathan his show , so i return my drugstore shampoo , dove pantene which always worked well my dry hair .	-1
my naturally curly hair thinning i thought this conditioner would helpful . conditioner not handle tangles my hair nor it make it feel conditioned . i thought it too drippy . i nearly used half bottle pouring it into my hand . i would not recommend this conditioner	1
this product works well when i use it curling iron . low rating cost . i just don't think it worth over $20	1
i'm sure this hair dryer exceptional quality - perhaps worth price some . but i'd careful buying something uses fake science babble try convince you its effectiveness . " most ionic infrared " gibberish . tourmaline , gemstone , electrical properties ( when squeezed or heated , it develops charge across crystal ) , but nothing hair drying , or ionizing air , or anything else . i'd recommend buying less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead falling pseudoscientific scam	1
bought this help myself achieve some punch my existing waves . all i got crimps wierd places . found instruction booklet completely not useful . i tried tried but could not produce anything remotely close wave , curl etc . save your money	1
okay , i'll admit . i bought into hype . oooo , no " sulfates " ... oooo , " essential water " .... oooo , " all natural " - no animals sacrificed making or testing this - " vegan " shampoo conditioner ... i headed into shower confidence i finally dumped $35 shampoo conditioner set would make difference my fine straight hair . what difference it made ... volume created products all flyaway hair : styled static electricity generated my hair devoided any moisture it once held this lovely " dessicant " shampoo . no amount so-called conditioner helped right wrong ! i tried various amounts conditioner left it longer longer periods time without any change results . after 3 days feeling wicked witch west better hair days than i , i returned produc t.t his product truly deserves 0 stars !!	-1

i would absolutley love this product if it came apllicator brush instead roller ball . roller ball hardly lets any gloss come out , you find yourself rolling it over over again get decent amount gloss . gloss itself pretty(once you get enough your lips . ) it taste smell delicious . but it way too much trouble roller ball . i would suggest they make this applicator brush . it would make great product	1
run fast you ... not try ! okay , so i bought hype " blow out " . once i saw " jonathan " product line shelf , i thought , " hmmm , how yummy ! " boy , i disappointed . moisturizing shampoo anything but ! product felt like mixture tree sap glue . once applied hair , i felt knots forming . upon rinsing , my hair like it stripped ! i used lots companion conditioner hoping balancing act , but left aghast when i rinsed felt " new " texture my hair . i couldn't comb it out wide tooth comb until i applied leave conditioner product line ! once dry , my hair felt gritty , brittle generally nasty . i'm taking this stuff back demanding refund ! i'm going back my frederick fekkai products immediately	-1

i am so disappointed !!!!!!!!!!! i ordered this scent after hearing it friends , reading great reviews . all reviews i read mentioned lack staying power this product , but i never expected product so extraordinarily weak . don't get me wrong , i not want my fragrance enter room before i ( after all , it not 80 anymore lol ) , but i also not want sniff my wrist so hard detect scent i take off skin ! scent beautiful , i would love wear it ! but 20 minutes after i sprayed it , i could barely detect fragrance . sometimes it harder " smell your own perfume " , i asked my hubby friends their opinions . they could barely smell it either . i would happily wear this scent every day if i could enjoy it all . if philosophy create this scent staying power , they customer life . it stands now , i would not recommend anyone buy this product . it very disappointing waste money	-1
this perfume deserves negative stars . i macy when i saw this fragrance dior counter . bottle gorgeous , i really like hypnotic poison miss dior cherie , so i figured i would give this one try . i really should smelled directly bottle before spraying it my skin . it horrible . white floral scents generally not my thing , but i usually tolerate them . this worst perfume i ever smelled . it way too powdery it smells so cheap . i stuck it my wrist all day it kept making me sneeze . disgusting . not worth money all . if you want buy this scent , i would recommend buying dove deodorant spray instead . it much cheaper smells exactly same . i wonder if it really dove deodorant but repackaged ... hmm ..	-1
this item doesn't include everything mention details . i wouldn't even pay dollar it . don't purchase this item !!!!!!!!!!	-1

key my heart lipgloss chain very cute , original idea , but it fails deliver quality worthy hard candy name . reviews here all stated this cute keychain , gloss nice colors pretty . all very true . i got my keychain pixie tones they're girly pretty i feeling pretty cool it . however , me , disenchantment came mechanics it . now , i've always fairly careful person , i'm not klutzy nor i drop or lose things . my keys normal standard set keys , i never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that normal yet , after less than week keychain hinges broken twice . first time i able make little mess superglue scotch tape managed rescue it put it back into almost normal condition , second time however , i only noticed entire thing fallen completely apart because i saw only half keychain remained my keys all covered pink goo . how it come apart like this ? i honestly no idea my keys only made very normal trajectory ignition my purse . i honestly only chalk it up really , really shoddy craftsmanship which may adequate dresser-top lipgloss but never something could get even remotely more movement than . it good idea but too low-quality fit purpose keychain . this not way go gloss your keys	1
my husband revolted smell this product . i bad sinuses , so it didn't bother me . far effectiveness goes , there no miracle ingredients this concoction . i used it everyday , several times day , noticed no lasting improvement look or feel skin my hands . cost almost $20 8.5 oz ., i got skunked	1
i bought this soap just see what all philosophy hype all . i not impressed . it smells just like ordinary soap-so what ? only reason i gave it 2 stars because it lather well . you get soap smells better wal-mart !	1
i read label , it not rare , tropical oil all , but plain old american palm oil ! false advertising really bothers me . it condition my hair well , but i agree fragrances ( which added it , way ) make odor very strong unpleasant . price also very high . i not order this again	1
this hit or miss product . i ordered 5 oz jar while smell nauseating ( burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes ) , product work while . my extremely dry , curly hair soft shiny but then product became too heavy my hair stopped working . i would save my money experiment other oils such coconut , jojoba , almond , avocado before shampooing or after . i adjusted my hair routine using natural shampoo conditioner adding jojoba oil my curl cream it never happier . if you want try product , ask company send you samples or find store sells them .	1
disappointed customer . i very thick , coarse , wavy hair trying manage it nightmare ! before using fekkai luscious curls lotion , i using aveda curly lotion matrix curl . life contouring creme . both latter products work very well my hair . i don't like blow dry my hair ( too time-consuming ) , so i just air dry it . without blow drying , whether i'm using aveda or matrix , results great ! my hair smooth , shiny , less frizzy . i never used fekkai products before , but decided give this one try . everything luscious curl enhancing lotion claimed , didn't my hair . fact , it actually made my hair worst ! it became stiffer , drier looking , frizzier . addition , my wavy hair , ( usually bouncy alive ) , became flat dull . also , i didn't like scent this particular curling lotion . it very strong smelling made me nauseous . because my very poor experience fekkai luscious curls lotion , i wouldn't recommend it anyone . i think i'll stick aveda matrix curling lotions , since they much more compatible my hair .	-1
i've using this product almost 2 months i seen no difference whatsoever appearance my dark circles . yes , it burn ! only thing i'm glad i bought it ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere . i've dark under-eye circles all my life . i suppose i should just learn live them save my money . i not wasting my money this product again	-1

one , i don't think this better than botox . botox works instantly more dramatically , but it more expensive . however , when you think how much you're spending this strivectin , applying it every day rest your life , you could get botox ( yes , you need get more botox every several months , but costs same ) . not only , but botox simply works better . however , if you just can't afford botox , then i would buy rulinea fx which exact same ingredients strivectin , but half price , it available hsn.co	1
never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1
i honest . i bought all hype mineral make-ups . my sister uses bare essentials her skin looked flawless she uneven tones like i . i didn't want pay price or join club so i tried pur minerals . i still use " cover-up " under my eyes blemishes put pur minerals rather heavy get " flawless " look . but then it looked too powdery . i started using my regular cover-girl foundation powder again i felt it covered better less heavy . just note , my sister said she still uses " cover up stick " when using bare essentials too , but she looked beautiful it	1

overpriced mediocre soap terrible perfume	1
this product might better oily skin no make-up . point it lost me . it may create barrier treatment products/moisturizer make-up but it nothing perfect my skin . fact when i touched my face i could feel make-up pilling rolling off . it dry , heavy feeling it . don't use too much careful dry patches . i thought it would make better canvas my skin . i now use laura mercier primer which goes light smooth gives healthy glow . i didn't like formulation philosophy product all	1
i normally like warm , sensual-type perfumes , but i wanted try something different change . i liked fact this advertised subtle not perfumey . well ... i disagree . i think it very perfumey not subtle all . me it very sharp , high-toned scent which almost acrid . i thought first maybe i sprayed too much , so i tried just little spritz . still very strong sharp . i agree comparison dead flowers dryer sheets . i definitely not ordering this again .	-1
one my " boys " bought this item me , well its ok price ... its kinda sticky skin unless you rub it really well ... scent extremly light which i dont like , now if they make it stronger ... this would 5 star product	1
i am dissatisfied lush claims many its products , like this one , natural . i encourage buyers who looking products made natural ingredients carefully read ingredients lush products . i yet see lush product not contain chemicals questionable safety . there numerous other brands truly all-natural soaps shampoos work excellently	-1
i've this dryer almost year now , like styists who also own it , i find it temperamental . it great job while it working , but thermostat gets progressively buggier after three months . if you turn dryer off , you'll wait it cool completely before it turn back . now , it turns off while i'm middle doing my hair . stylists three or four these so they alternate working one while other(s ) cool off - i said , when they work , they're terrific . i'm going replace mine brand	1
this fragrance ok teen princesses . this scent doesn't linger too subtle . not nice vera wang vanity or sheer veil . i don't recommend this unless you 16 under . i gave it my 11 year old she loves it	1
i'm everyone else when they say they diappointed this product . i opened this bottle , expecting totally yummy scent but what i got nothing like what i expected ! when i read it smelled nesquick , i thought i'd like it anyway , because i love strawberry nesquick . but this stuff smells like ... well , i can't describe it . all i know i wish i hadn't paid $16 it . live learn , i guessperhaps strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel smells better . off topic , why they strawberry milk shake 3-in-1 gel strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel ? wouldn't they smell just same	1
i knew i taking chance buying cheap eye cream sure enough i right . it nothing ! well yo get what you pay ! i going try ocuderm or ddf products i guess i now . costs more but results i hear great . i should known better ...	-1

i received this free sephora birthday present because i signed up beauty insider . i gave it my neice her 7th birthday she likes it , but there no reason this product should cost $16 . i'm betting ingredients , packaging shipping costs don't total more than $3 . i wouldn't buy it .	1
i read many good reviews this product this site elsewhere so i eagerly bought it . it came quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind awful . skin softner , it worked well but i threw it out after using it only few times because way it smelled	1
i bought ultra hydrating shampoo , conditioner , treatment , oh also hairspray . these products dried my hair out horribly weighed it down . i gave it 2 weeks because it so expensive after two weeks my hair never looked any worse ! i naturally wavy , thick coarse hair this made my hair unmanageable - like helmet head . my hair no movement , no shine -- just made it very heavy weighed down . last night i used hair purifier shampoo gets gunk , minerals , etc out your hair after i deep conditioned it kerestase masintense - wow , what difference !! afer blowdrying my hair it soft , shiny so much bounce ! i woke up this morning my hair still awesome . so glad my old hair back - i beginning think i hormone problem or water problem but it this ojon product - horrible if you type hair i . good luck	-1

i bought this item because i heard it waterproof i looking something wear swimming . i'm really not impressed . one thing i say it color blended well my skin . bottle it looked like it would way too dark , so i surprised . it looks like there might little wiggle room far choosing correct shade this one . coverage not very good , though . you put little extra without it looking cakey , but it doesn't cover well say lancome photogenic foundation . i also highly doubt it waterproof . water-resistant , maybe . defintely not waterproof . it rubbed off pretty easily dry kleenex even more came off wet one . when i tried coverblend water resistant makeup i use soap get it off . coverage also much better . unfortunately they don't offer many shades leg body makeup . i also found dew finish not work my skin . i combination skin tend shiny t-zone . this foundation left me shiny nose forehead . it also made rest my face feel slightly oily , which it normally not . overall i would say this foundation very poor value i defintely returning it sephora . least sephora free returns . :	1
i bought this mascara based review i read amazon . maybe it just me , but i still find my lashes " clump " or stick together this product . it might navy color . i don't think its worth extra cost - i just well drugstore mascara	1
smell gorgeous ; it really lives up its name " happy " -- ( just lightly musk-touched citrus overtones - it great scent day or night ) , but -- this big but , like real happiness , it very elusive . scent skin , it completely fades away after 10 minutes ! example , today i sprayed it quite liberally now can't smell it all , even if i put my nose my wrist ; i swear , it completely gone . very disappointed , thus cannot recommend it . 5 stars scent but minus 4 stars staying power = 1 star . even lightest perfumes should staying power , or else what point wearing them ?	-1
i got talked into buying this fresh boutique las vegas . first , it very expensive - $38 , forgivable if it outstanding . it not even good . wand isn't well made , product clump it , then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them . i tried all week make this purchase work out best , but no avail . worst part , end day if i happen rub my eyes , it smears - racoon eyes . i've using physicians formula revlon primer both exponentially better , i could purchased eight them cost supernova . positive side , it washes off easily completely soap water .	-1
i very unhappy this product . first shipping took way too long . second , tube much smaller than sold macy cost more . contents gross , very goopy . not smooth . like it sitting hot warehouse months . i'll fight mall buy this next time	-1
it doesn't work what we intended it : blackhead removal . my teen son really hoping this would help him .... it didn't . not only , but safety cap lance end doesn't stay .	-1
only reason i'm giving this two stars instead one because i love benefit . said , this perfume what we like call sleeper . it so faint you hardly smell it , but when you , it not pleasing all you immediately scramble something smells better . if you looking young , fun perfume , stay away this one . it smells old drab , like your grandmother china cabinet or antique store . but if you like ..	1
i wouldn't call these regrettable purchase ... i guess i just little mislead how these thing worked . it doesn't explain packaging . i couldn't figure out why box so heavy . they just socks , right ? right ?? well , they aren't . insides coated some sort heavy-duty silicone . this makes your feet sweat when you put them . i mean , they really sweat . when you wake up , you're feet sweat so much any outer layer skin cells you sloughed off . hence soft feet . very warm feet . they'll good winter . reason why you're only supposed wear these once week because i bet you'll get really alarming fungus if you it more . i tried them two nights row once day 3 greeted me intense athletes-foot-like itch . not fun . other gripe i they don't come washing instructions . great . these socks one purpose life , make your feet sweat then refuse washed . i found handwashing them sink some handsoap works fine . now , anyway . i don't think they belong washing machine . laundry horror story likely ensue .	1

i love clinique products used them more than 20 years . exfoliating scrub convenient because it comes tube rinses off easily . ( though you only get 3.4 oz ., must use quite bit it see good results ) . however , it not work well original " seven day scrub " . original product while greasy bit pain use , exfoliates almost well professional microdermabrasion not irritate - even daily use . few years ago i spent summer neglecting use my sun block . needless say , my skin became mess ( dull , blotchy , discolorations , rough , flaky , etc . ) . i began my basic clinique regimen ( mild facial soap , clarifying lotion #2 , dramatically different moisturizing lotion , seven day srub ) . less than two weeks i saw huge difference , my skin back normal . i tried exfoliating scrub later , since i hated deal original " seven day " but soon went back it it truly works best . now i always wear spf 45 my face stick my seven day scrub .	1
this item fine when it came pictures ; tattoos not visible film first part our wedding . however i told few guests it looked like i fight before wedding ... make-up should not look like bruises ! make-up also started fade not long after ceremony ended , it short ceremony . end reception ( four hours later ) you could clearly see tattoos . also , i told make-up would not rub off onto clothing if i used special setting powder together cream ... not true . i now make-up stains one my brides maids dresses . i realize now i should just let tattoos show . why tattoo if you're not willing show it off	1
this my first cologne purchase . it really delicious scent -- complex pleasant , not overpowering . give it 15 min dry mix your skin . it truly smell different first spray . i can't stop smelling myself ... i really love smell . my only complaint ( it biggy ) it doesn't last more than few hours . after two or three hours it completely gone except slight trace when i press my nose my skin . i've tried spraying it my body ( neck , wrists ) also my clothing , it just doesn't last . i feel need carry bottle me reapply it every few hours , but that not going realistically happen . it really disappointing , since it so delicious	1
ok , so this 2nd philosophy product i've tried felt need write review . i say , this product far below expectations . i sprayed , only thing you smell alcohol . there seems no other notes it , even after you let it settle , all you pick up alcohol . definitely not recommending this product .	-1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
i bought this stuff because i heard it helped razor burn . my husband likes me shave bit more often than i liked , well , too bad him !! pain putting this stuff way worse than any sort razor burn ! no thanks !	-1
i used use tend skin . it works ok , but there better things out there now . tend skin outdated product ... like sytptic pencil . tend skin stings , smells like pure alcohol there lots wasted product because it easy spill . i recently switched min solution2 like it much better than tend skin . min solution2 roller application ( no waste ) , organic spearmint ( fresh smell ) doesn't burn like tend skin .	1
i love these products however , this particular candle not same , intense scent previous candles i've purchase	1
this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over . it terribly strong just not quite what i wanted . company promptly give me refund though . i suggest you try out " demeter fragrances . " they more natural smelling	-1
like fresh farmacy , i bought this soap based reviews ended up giving it friend work . don't get me wrong , i love most lush products , my husbands chagrin , end up spending lot money their online products but when i got this particular soap i just couldn't get into it . i admit it smelled bit better after showering it first time but still found myself reaching my " sexy peel " over this stuff . i ended up giving it friend i work but only after it passed over my three other girls my office ... i'm just not getting " heavenly scent " this item described previous reviews	1
i bought this my wife holidays , it bit expensive candle but i believed it would last long time burn uniformly . however , our case , after hour candle went out . wick burned too quickly , becoming too small , now candle won't stay lit more than few minutes before it drowns wax . return shipping cost lot , so we just toss it out . waste money , don't buy one	-1
this brush not firm expected . i expected greater quality sephora brand . however , price brush rather cheap comparison " finer " brushes . so actuality you getting whay you pay this item nothing more	1
this shampoo just awful . it greasy it made up 90/10 ratio , 90 oil 10 soap . smells great but leaves your hairl slimy gross	-1
i received two sizeable chunks karma soap couple my orders i thought i'd give it go . eeeep - there whole bunch patchouli there ( which i hate , but still thought i should least try ) . maybe i'm overly sensitive patchouli but it so strong . soap whole smelled like sickening mix syrup-y orange soda mixed dreaded patchouli . fair though , you smell different elements it appreciate it . aside this , this soap melts incredibly fast . even if you keep it draining soap dish , even if you take it completely out shower , away steam , it still melts alarming rate ! i see how people ( who love herbal scents ) would like this . it unique scent depth layers it , but it just not me	-1
like said earlier review , after couple weeks mirror quits working fogs up so bad you can't see thing it shower . i run hot water it it still fogs up after couple minutes , then you can't clear it any method . total waste , not worth dollar .	-1
rosey this oils smells , it just isn't good real thing . fragrance oil , it no medicinal properties . i certainly wouldn't use it my skin , or bath ! thanks , but no thanks . you definitely get what you pay	-1
i opened my falling love compact expecting lovely smell after reading hype . this worst smelling perfume-ever . when i put it it smelled like burnt clothing-like iron just it worst cotton . it so awful i put it straight bin	-1
i received this soap free online purchase . i never purchased soap lush i don't think i after my experience ooh la la . scent pleasant enough , color bar this stunning deep purple ( kind like grape ! ) , but it doesn't feel like soap when i'm using it . it kind smears purplish film me then when i rinse it off , my skin feels very tight dry . i've unable get any lather this bar , although admittedly i very hard water where i live . i read previous reviewers complained how long this soap lasts . like all lush products , it imperative you not leave it shower or tub let it dry completely uses . i've used bar four or five times while it noticeably smaller than when i opened it , i probably 90 percent it left .	1
i truly say this products doesn't work . i silky wavy fine hair i am hair food junkie so i used lot things , but this don't work . usually anything tame my hair but all this conditioner make it hard , matted , tangled . carol daughter products may work some , but it hasn't work anyone my family we all different hair textures	-1
i fell hype now am out quite bit money ....... save your money , trust me ! i used this product 2-3 times day until entire tube gone ( took several months ) saw no change whatsoever ! i serious dark circles , which what it claims help . i am very disappointed this company their product never buy any item their name it again ! what bunch crap ...... btw - look * all * reviews , this product listed several places here !!	-1
click-stick applicator ridiculous . you no control over shadow . when you click it , nothing comes out . you twist ten times , then , suddenly , huge blob , enough eighteen applications , comes busting out . only way i've found apply this use my own shadow brush dipped this huge blob . i purchased three colors same time all three tubes work this same way . far actual shadow , it fine . nothing spectacular . you could get same product wet'n wild buck .	1
i spent $$$ this supposed miracle product month ago .... don't waste your money ... absolutly no results .	-1
i used phytospecific relaxer my virgin hair during summer ( 2006 ) . i first thought it great investment ($60 ) worth cost . after use , i found my hair relaxed but not " bone straight " i've experienced other relaxers which what i desired . my hair very soft fine quite sensitive chemicals so i search product would straighten my hair not leave any damaging affects . after 2nd treatment ( september 2006 ) , i soon found my hair experiencing breakage around temples severe breakage nape my neck . i quit using product . perhaps this product works some but mentioned earlier , my hair quite sensitive chemicals unfortunately , i experienced hair loss ! so , it back drawing ( or growing ) board me	1
instructions say , " use whenever your skin needs boost . " it goes imply you see result every time you use it - it not one these products where you need use it repeatedly see results . i bought it big upscale department store used it night . now winter approaching , my skin gets little wacky times . product comes out gel but becomes creamy you apply it damp skin . instructions leave it until " full froth " forms ( approximately 5 minutes ) , then rinse off . cream began take consistency foam after 2 minutes , end 5 minutes foam beginning dissipate leave big empty patches my skin , so i rinsed it off . my skin didn't look any different when . it didn't feel any different when . $52 i expected least some type visible change - even if it made my skin redder , or plumper , or something . unfortunately box now bottom trash , so i can't return it . we christmas guests coming ; maybe one them enjoy using it	-1
all honesty , i'd rate fragrance itself " 5 stars , " however , scent not last love nor money , which why i give it mere " 1 star . " you'll find you continuously apply it order anyone compliment you it , consequently , before you know it , you've depleted your perfume ! talk anyone who worn or even sells this fragrance , if they're honest , they tell you exactly what i've written here . because i adore scent , i'm going try baby phat goddess body lotion see if lingering effect	-1
this didn't anything me . it supposed very subtle cumulative effect ? i am returning it . i'm really surprised others such great results , because i tried it twice left it double time , still it nothing more than wash my face maybe moisturize cream . it more than baking soda h2o2- also contains catalase , some stearic acid , some vitamin . course , your skin already its own catalase .	-1
ok ive using proactiv 4 year now i say it work me well like 90% one or two breakouts month so i pretty pleased . people often asked me what i cuz my change drastic , so nice . one night i styed up late murad infomercial came it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it they even compared it proactiv , so i tough i would give it try so i ordered it online next day . couple days later i received package i pretty exited so i began use it liked overall feel it . few days pass i wake up one morning all these little white heads my upper chin i immidiately grossed out but since they said it normal due purging i didnt worry much , one week later it got worse even began breaking out places i hadnt before like my forehead . i knew somethign wasnt right so i went online started reading other custumer reviews shocked similaruty thwe problem so i freaked out decided stop using it because it got so bad point where i didnt wanna seen top it became very painful both physically mentally i becamed sorth depressed situation i sorth felt like teen going trough puberty again . i now gone back proactiv seen improvement so hopefully within next couple weeks it clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under rock hahaha . my main advice really ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before	-1
like others i disappointed after couple times using this product . like others i started breakout where i not broken out before , my forehead etc . i bought this product because i problem areas . using this product brought out more problem areas dried out my skin . i used product prescribed . commercial said it gentle what made this product different rest it wouldn't cause acne only it " gentle " formula help it immediate results . not true all . this just like any other product market acne . if you weeks pain suffering embarrassing breakouts more than what you before get results , this product you . i , other hand , couldn't deal additional embarrassment my skin getting worse before it got better . when my trouble areas weren't bad first place . not recommended they advertise . they aren't different than others . proactive same thing .	-1
i didn't know you supposed peel waxy rubbery black stuff off soap ... i normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good , i try it . i ended up covered black , waxy streaks all over my body when i got out shower ! they didn't rinse off , either . only thing seemed work rub really vigorously towel ... i still black smudges wax residue . once i figured out how take knife coating , i better opinion soap , except it pretty much cut soap half . it smelled really nice , but i don't think i would get this again .	1
i very high hopes this cream , it appears they went extra mile quality . not so . cream when used leaves alot friction razor goes over your face , making some tense moments should not there . i used many creams . so far art shaving best . casswell massey ok aveda . avoid truefitt . update . trufitt hill accepted return we spoke problems . they sent me new updated extra fine version should available public now same quality massey . it good . standard still substandard	-1
i worked two women who worn this perfume , frankly , i can't stand smell it . it doesn't even smell like perfume , it like some bizarre animal musk . there no floral notes , no woodsy notes , either ; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant . i wish this perfume didn't exist --- i hate it .	-1
i thick coarse hair looking something make it softer . i used just little bit it really greasy . i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum . it works much better	1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
it only takes little bit reading realize abrading skin piece metal not solution ending blackheads/enlarged pores . using this " extractor " equal using one fingers squeeze out imperfections , which may produce very temporary results , but ultimately fruitless . those who feel need purchase this device should invest professional deep-cleaning instead , which rid skin excess oil help pores close without aggravation	-1
my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
if you some respect your nose , please don't buy these wipes !!! i bought these thinking maybe it would nice soft smell , but these thing more than enough perfume stink your whole house !!! i would never put it delicate skin my baby	-1

i bought tendskin help irritation razor bumps i get my neck shaving . product claims , " reduce appearance unsightly razor bumps , ingrown hairs , redness shaving . " but despite it lofty promises high price , it none this . fact my case it made irritation red bumps worse , i sensitive skin main ingredient this product alcohol . directions tell you apply it after shaving , but because alcohol dries out your skin painful apply after shaving , it only made my problem worse . i wish i could rated this product zero stars , because it absolutely worthless	-1
i think i may bad batch because when i read reviews how yummy it smelled , made me curious . so , i tried it i hated it ! smell it turned my stomach . it soften my hair bit , but i don't recommend using it again . sorry lush	-1
i really excited this ! i hoped it would faster , easier way make up what not , but its not . it smears like crazy , end so sharp , it hurts apply . but doesn't matter ! end stops working after use or two . i suppose if you wanted make up similar raccoon blueish eyes ( black more navy then black ) you'll happy . i've always loved mark products , but this disappointment	1
i bought this product mainly because my daughter fair , sensitive skin , which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation . this product worked very well far thoroughly cleaning her face , hands etc . it not irritate her skin all ... problem , one only problem , fragrance , if you call it . it stinks so bad , i not want go near her after i wiped her down ... i give her bath , it so bad	1
i ordered " fedora " . i am so dissapointed , it came off within few hours ! just peeled right off . not order this brand fingernail polish . it worst i ever used	-1

well first off , i'm guy very short hair ... so i don't know whether or not it really works . but i'm bored decided rate it anyway . so here goes : consconditioner really thick difficult get out bottle . best solution this let bottle sit upside down . prossmells damn good . i'm not big fan fruity/coconut aromas , but i like this particular smell so much i might need go rehab sometime future . bottom line : although this conditioner difficult get out bottle , it smells really good . whether or not it work your hair , only way know try it . even if ot doesn't work your hair ... it worth 20 bucks just open it up smell it every now then . =)	1
very picky shampoo this really good dry color treated hair . i tell it made difference	1
i used this product this morning first time . i washed my hair , blew it dry , most way , then rubbed product my hands lightly distributed it throughout my hair . best way me describe it , , it like creamy hairspray . yes , it tacky , like hairspray , but that how it helps you get style you want . what i like how it works my hair , it really tamed frizzes brought down " big " hair look i usually after blowing my thick hair dry . i think it would also work well days i blow my hair out . i would probably blow it out first , then apply some dirt help tame smooth it . i see where it might make thinner , straighter hair bit limp , so careful not use very much . edit : i think it best apply slightly damp hair , might help people trouble applying it completely dry hair	1
i chi turbo ( 1 " ) , but i got worried after reading some reviews it unreliable . so part reason i wanted buy t3 iron it comes 4-year comprehensive warranty . other difference solid-ceramic plates " infused " tourmaline which i found intriguing . 1-3/8 " wide plates perfect width my long-ish hair . ( i've used 2 inch wide iron , which i found harder maneuver . ) it heats up fast , stays hot . it great job gripping hair without snagging . my hair stays silky straight all day , not feel damaged after while , like it cheaper irons i've used past . thing this iron other irons not well - it really curls . it heat vents sides plates lets you curl your hair twisting it near root pulling it through ( different usual method gripping ends strands then winding up ) . it creates springy curl better than any flat iron i've used . ( however , heating vents make exterior iron hotter touch . so there drawback this function . ) overall , i enjoy using this flat iron . very happy this purchase . eta : i've learned hairart not honor warranty unless you buy it authorized distributor ( e.g. , sephora ) . so you might want check before you place your order	1
after reading other reviews i little worried using product i already ordered . after using it few days now my hair never looked better , i truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner meant me . i fine , super straight hair , middle short . it feels clean sleek . conditioner smells like pina coloda , yum ! i would definatly recommend this my hair type . would maybe recommend lather shampoo your hands first then work thoroughly ( it doesn't lather well some shampoos lots glycerine them ) only apply conditioner towards end your hair leave few min . hope helps	1
high beam nice subtle highlighter . however , sure blend it very quickly well or it look unnatural certain lighting ( it'll look like you pink nail polish your face ) . it also tendency emphasize pores . so only use it areas your face where you don't any , like top cheek bone under your eyebrows .	1

this dry iron absolutely amazing , i really can't say enough it . great all types hair ! it heats up just seconds what would take almost 2hrs blow dry my hair now takes less than half time . plus your hair comes out extremely straight . highly recommend anyone who wants their hair look great but doesnt time or energy sit hair salon hours . it investment your hair , one better ones i've made .	1
this great product getting bed head look . i use approximately dime size worth my palms go wild ! trust me , results great . if you apply too much , you're hair get oily . good thing this product washes out easily any shampoo	1
i long , thick , wavy hair loves frizz up . i tried every anti-frizz , hairstyling product out there , they either didn't work or weighed my hair down . i didn't want like this hair dryer hoping it wouldn't live up hype ... but , it excellent my hair . after using dryer ( no styling product ) my hair straight , shiny felt great . me , it didn't change amount time i dried my hair , so if your considering buying it speed , don't , unless you thin or short hair . it worth $200.00 price tag ? depends you personally , but i recommend you shop around because there better deals out there	1
i bought shampoo theory condition theory this redo freshen-up mist . i normal-type hair needs washed every other day -- if i use lot product , it needs washed every day . i very sensitive skin too . this mist worked very well my hair , definitely freshened it up allowed me restyle it quick blow dry . it feels awesome my skin . well , jonathan	1

my hair tends fall out due me not eating enough protein , so new ! ( hair ) lifesaver . others said , it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need roll it your hands two or three times get enough thick lather -- it amazing scent . ( sniffing bar actually bit addictive ... you smell it really strongly even before you open box ! ) i've found keeping it small lightly covered dish my bedroom , away moisture bathroom , best way preserve it while . ( also , it works accidental room freshener -- seriously , smell incredible ! )my only wish scent would last little longer my hair , since it doesn't really stick , even right after showering , unless i use lot lather , ends up expensive since then bar doesn't last long . most time , there isn't even much hint , whereas other lush shampoos make your hair smell wonderful , even bit overpowering , days . also , unlike some other lush products , it leaves my hair fairly flat . it true it helps making hair really soft shiny , but it seems opposite effect when it comes volume , that not so good when you're already some hair loss . using mostly scent-free conditioner after almsot necessary , least my experience . i think new ! ( hair ) terrific shampoo its hair-restoring qualities general sniffability , but same time , it could little better its more cosmetic qualities . buy it more former than latter if you want most enjoyment value out it . if you hair loss , trust me -- price worth it	1

this great product . only reason i don't give it full five stars it alleged not ' significant ' amounts vitamin , which supposed its selling point . i , however , buy it because five years or so i used this product , i gotten lot compliments firmness my skin , since i started using it my skin actually become less oily than when i first started using it . i first purchased this product because some damage i my skin using popular acne product . my skin looked felt though i burned acid . i promptly stopped using product purchased this cream cream cleanser because i hoped these products would soothing . they definitely . within matter weeks my skin started feel better . moreoever , it took plump , more youthful appearance ( no sagging ! ) . within month or so , my skin much less oily than it . since i first purchased this product i strayed but always come back . winter i use heavier nightcream experienced same results . regular cream pink color not smell perfume . texture wise it heavier than lotion but still feels slippery touch . i highly recommend you try this cream	1
word wise sizeif this your first time buying lush soap online , forewarned . you receive piece 1 " thick 4-5 " long . other words , you receiving fairly small piece soap . if you lush store near you , i strongly recommend you go smell huge chunks soap they display . once you find scent you like , buy � lb brick it . it cost little over $20 , but it worth it if you find soap you love . i also find it easier experience full scent soap bigger slice . i know lush stores few far ( closest one me 35 miles away -- not far , but too far convenient ) , but if you grab couple friends make road trip out it , it adventure ! now , rock star . what delightful soap . if you fan mmmm .... melting marshmallows bath melt , then you also enjoy rock star . scent same . it also same snow fairy shower gel creamy candy bath melt . i cannot quite place my finger scent . main ingredient it vanilla absolute , but this smells much more sweet girly . there definite floral scent lurking under vanilla , but i am loss try describe it ! it sort smells like warm cotton candy hint brown sugar . it closest i come trying describe scen t.t he scent rock star linger your skin entire day . it absolutely wonderful . it also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh . every time my husband uses upstairs bathroom , he come find me ask what smells so good our bathroom . it fabulously creamy soap it lathers quite well . if you white tile your bathroom , it leave pink lather pile tile , but it easy enough wash off . there couple minor downsides rock star . but they minor : 1 . it melts way too fast . i just wished it lasted bit longer . 2 . it leave skin feeling bit too squeaky clean . when i first started using rock star , i thought it would give me dry skin , but hasn't case . it just feels bit dry after showering . despite these small issues , rock star perfect soap make you feel bit girly bit sexy , all same time .	1

like someone else said , i don't problem paying high quality beauty item works it says it . cinnamon buns great lather , smells wonderful when you use it , makes your skin soft . i used it shampoo scent lingers bit longer using it your hair , but it really doesn't function well shampoo it shower gel . bubble bath ya use so much it i just can't it . i find myself counting ounces i'm pouring under faucet decided use it treat only . smell doesn't last very long , but found it linger longer if you lather , rinse repeat , like it says bottle . it dollar ounce ..... not sure if i'll try any other ' flavors ' simply because cost	1

this best shaving product whole wide world . if you exfoliate first then use it , nothing gets smoother legs me my sensitive skin . yes , it seems kind expensive but you just need tiny bit time thin layer so it actually lasts longer me than several bottles regular shave gel . it also takes up less space	1
this product works very well my fair nordic sensitive skin . it covers well , but light , non-oily feeling , combined fluff og powder , it leaves my skin looking flawless . i highly recommend this product .	1
if i choose fragrance most feminine i've ever smelled , it would marc jacobs . yes , it gardenia based scent , but definitely not your typical musty , heavy gardenia any means . marc jacobs different it ' wet gardenia ' , like you're smelling bunch gardenias swirling around bowl fresh water . intoxicatingly alluring . notes this fragrance : gardenia , wild muguet , skin musk , cedar , ginger . gardenia this faint , but lovely . it isn't knock-you-out strong gardenia , but very mellow mesmerizing . it'll follow you like breath fresh air , you'll people sniffing air you leave behind . :) if you've ever smelled michael michael kors , this different . michael not gardenia , but it tuberose scent . it very strong , creamy , heavy , thick . if you like michael , you may like marc jacobs your spring/summer alternative . they're same family terms florals such , but different terms how they wear . marc jacobs flowy , michael heavy . 1.7 oz . retails $65 , 3.4 oz . $85 . it quite expensive , but it brand-name smacked front . :) i think it worth it . lasting power decent . even when you may feel it gone , it not , people compliment you . try it out see how you like it your skin	1
my boyfriend used search online stores french cologne jean patou pour homme because it only " upscale " cologne he would wear ( it awesome ! ) . however , it not produced anymore very hard find very expensive . he searched high low find replacement , this it ! sean john unforgivable surprisingly good . masculine , but not too musky or cheap smelling . now , this all my boyfriend wear - i'm not complaining ! guys - women love how you smell when you wear this . women - buy this your boyfriends/husbands , but only let them wear it when they're date you ! :) anyway , it worth cost , it our new favorite .	1
i never smelled any cologne good this . unforgivable absolutely wonderful ! i saw diddy several talk shows promoting this fragrance thought here we go ... famous person perfume industry - not gonna any good . so i go shopping other day see tester bottle . i try it . sprayed it little piece paper immediately asked sales clerk give me biggest bottle they . it amazing . my boyfriend comes home work , i present him cologne he wasn't thrilled ( not into colognes such ) , but promises try it anyway . he didn't hate it !!! that thrilled he gets anything , so i knew then it good thing . i just can't quit smelling him , his clothes , his car - everything smells unforgivable ! we went out some friends dinner drinks both my girlfriends pulled me aside ask what cologne he wearing - they wanted buy it their guys too ! now i can't wait women fragrance come out ... seanjean definitely winner here	1
i really like this conditioner lush . i wash my hair everyday , because this ( long soaks bath ) my hair gets pretty dry . this conditioner absorbed really quickly doesn't overpowering scent . i am not huge fan coconut , but this shampoo makes my hair smell like tropical cocktail which i think really nice . i wouldn't use it every day don't recommend it unless you dry hair needs bit extra care . i used american cream but i think coolaulin better , least my hair . i thick , straight , mid-length hair . great conditioner make hair soft but strong , also shiny	1
after suffering terrible cold all week i finally succumbed hot bath . i rummage through my box filled lush products ( gift thoughtful boyfriend ) when i pulled out this huge disc broke out half while saving other one more bath . i didn't even know what this called but minute it touched water , refreshing invigorating essences lemons milky cream escaped my nose , i felt happy instant , it amazing ! even thought my nose refused recognize scent days i smelled oils citrusy botanicals , bath water filled tiny bubbles i soaked my cold stress away . after bath i felt great , my skin bones felt refreshed i warm , cozy felt lot better . after looking it up online i really surprised see this called happy pill , because it really make me happy . i am really looking forward using other half , hopefully when i'm not sick anymore . once again lush came through me products they so lovingly create i cannot recommend their bath bombs enough . whether taken fun bath product or relieve cold or sadness they always work gentle relaxing ways . main ingredients this little love ball good skin nourishers such olive oil , hemp oil , grapefruit oil , bergamot oil , frankincense oil , lemon oil , grange flower absolute , mandarin oil , gardenia extract ( yum ! ) sodium bicarbonate . happy bathing ! - kasia .	1

if you love baths , but simply must bubbles , then bubble bars lovely addition salt soak . you also add one these or half bubble bar one bath bombs . i keep buying bath bombs giving them away gifts , which excuse buy more lush products ! i've tried numerous bubble bath products these seem produce especially fun amount bubbles . you literally hide below bubbles , there so many . you also get added benefit more essential oils . lush products , you may get journal just bath bliss experiences . there certain products you blend together create moods moments . ~ rebecca revie	1
china glaze my favorite polish , but perhaps it because they only ones i've ever seen this color #86 , your touch . it so gorgeous , i've compliments it nearly every place i go . china glaze seems limited retail distribution , so i've order it online years - this vendor perhaps best ever sending it out so quickly ! great job	1

i love auqolinas first ground breaking perfume " pink sugar " death but it such overpowering scent i am often smelled before i am seen perhaps such strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate . aquolinas new perfume " chocolovers " similarly sweet , but much subtler . if you love sweet scent pink sugar but don't like how you smelled 12 feet away , try chocolovers	1

i'm always skeptical " age defying " products , but this one really works . i've using it since it first came out ( maybe 10 years ? ) people often think i'm younger than i am ( 27 ) . i'm not really using it though - i use it because it unreal how good it acne . it prevents breakouts also heals current pimples so fast . when i run out , breakouts back	1

unless you super oily skin cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions , you shouldn't use this . i oily/normal skin find even this dry lotion moisturizing enough me . it definitely not dry skins or sensitive types . kinerase products touted their ultra sensitive ingredients , but beware , this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which fact irritate your skin . though this seem deliver some skin smoothing , it not my opinion , good cream version which much better balancing skin , not contain retinyl palmitate . both good , but kinerase cream better	1
i using this product over year . only took couple weeks improve very thin skin under my eyes . little goes long , long way . one jar lasted me 4 months using every day . this product blends into skin quickly i use it under make-up . it calms my skin . i am happy this product	1
what brilliant package ! it squeezebottle brush end , twist lid . no spills , no mess , no disaster . love it ! it easy apply brush . i lava flow , which shimmery pink . shimmer more obvious than i would like , it big flecks sparkle , but it isn't so bad it looks like glitter glue . there strong smell taste , sorta tropical ; although it isn't unpleasant , it powerful . kinda reminds me red koolaid . color bright pink when first applied , but simmers down medium pink rather sheer . container color looks unwearable , but reality it isn't dramatic . only drawback how sticky it feels . it less sticky than mac lipglass , but more so than urban decay xxx , if makes sense . i got this freebie i'm glad i got try it . i would buy it but different color	1
earlier i read all reviews retread . paying 20 bucks conditioner not quite suit me . however , i using it month now i say reviews inadequate discription product . personally , i believe this amazing product . i used it combination big i believe my hair never looked better . retread superb conditioner really wonders . i virgin hair , but i blow dry it ever day so i felt heavier conditioner necessary . since this deeper conditioner i would leave it 5-10 min or while you all your other stuff shower/bath . my hair softer than ever afterwards ( could big though ) shined like sun . this not everyday conditioner but works well once or twice week ( i mainly use it special occasions , or when i just want feel pretty ! ) i highly recommend it i feel it works much better than lush conditioning treatments . only issue smell . i am not much into smell cucumbers me what it smelled like . however , this could just personal attribute no one else mentioned this . product still amazing though , i am willing endure smell(it fades day goes ) . my decision this product miracle ! hope this helps !	1
i sensitive , acne prone , combination skin ( oily t-zone ) . i've used various toners months time this first toner doesn't burn when i use it . it reminds me better smelling witchhazel astringent -i used witchhazel kid help prevent my skin breaking out . it nice fruity scent which great since most toners ( especially clinique ) smell like alcohol . i just wish it little cheaper ! bottle pretty big so it last me 3 months which makes price not quite so painful . i use it clarifiance oil free gel cleanser morning night	1

this mascara great , it easy remove little warm water , but best thing it it won't give you ' racoon eyes ' . there no dis-coloration skin around eyes . it also keeps looking great all through day , no need re-apply i t.t he only reason i am not giving it 5 stars , even though they come different colors , they all look more black than colored when dry . so color doesn't stand out enough . still , i highly recommend it	1

orris root powder scent similar violets although this tisty tosty bath bomb , even addition rose oil , it not overpowering fragrance . i think they could add double rose oil , but you add rose ylang ylang if you mood . tisty tosty heart-shaped bath bomb perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer mild/calming bathing experience . i'd suggest using this one skin calming also adding " romance stone , " " sex bomb " or " chelsea garden " bath bomb add little more romance bath . i feel emotionally calm ( rose balances emotions ) my skin loved this bath bomb , but it not sensory i'd hoped . following this bath " it pleasure treasure massage bar " fun , also heart-shaped . you may want try " violet " soap this bathing experience . next time i try this , i might mix it " elixir " bath melt bit " bathos " bubble bar , also scented violet . far this magic spell , you just never know who might call you when you use this bath . probably right when you bath . so , if you think this work instantly , you might want keep phone tub . it funny , but when i bath , my husband trying call me said he let phone ring ring . he really think i would leave pleasure lush bath answer phone ? personally , i think they should scent this bath bomb like it pleasure treasure massage bar . it blissfully delicious almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate ( it mostly cocoa butter ) heady scent orange blossom honey neroli . ~ rebecca review	1

while most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn , you know very few them actually protect against photodamage ? only two sunscreen ingredients protect against long uvai rays cause photodamage ( brown spots , wrinkles , etc ); zinc oxide parsol 1789 . zinc oxide protects broader range these rays than parsol 1789 . this skinceuticals sunscreen zinc oxide it goes without any white film or greasiness-perfect daily use face . while neutrogena dry touch suncreens feel more invisible skin ( you can't even tell it except smell ) good alternative ( parsol 1789 ) , i still prefer skinceuticals added protection virtually no scent whatsoever . since it expensive , i tend use it just face use cheaper ( like neutrogena ) sunscreen body when out sun .	1

this far most expensive relaxer i've ever used it worth every penny . i first heard it oprah relaxer so i decided hunt it down . one best things i've ever . i very coarse , thick " horsehair " usually defeats most over counter perms after few washings . not phytospecific relaxer . my hair stayed soft straight no matter what weather or i it . it healthiest it ever . no other relaxer ever my hair . fact they usually made it worse ! i absolutely love phytorelaxer i am officially addicted . if it less pricey , it would get 5 stars	1

this fragrance took me quite surprise when i first tried it magazine sample , so much so i knew i try it department store - this little over year ago . then i sampled it department store all my nose could think " wow ! " - gardenias my grandmother garden , suntan oils tropical perfumes i smelled little girl beach , few more florals blended make this fragrance even more exotic sensual - i knew i it ! i bought myself bathgel lotion set put large bottle cologne my x-mas list , which my sweet generous boyfriend got me . my opinion , this probably most alluring fragrance women i ever smelled . i feel very alluring every time i wear it my boyfriend - he loves it ! so this would great gift man wife or girlfriend , or woman best friend , sister or cousin ( long you wear it your own man , too ! ) , but slightly awkward gift give your mother , aunt or grandmother - it enticing . but if your single older relative or friend simply must it one her gifts , then it given one her female friends , sister , cousin or " santa " . way there won't any awkwardness gift-giving time . believe me - this fragrance olfactory equivalent french lingerie or string bikini !	1

i agree previous reviewer , smell candy like fragrance . i generally wear oscar or chloe , but this fragrance nice change . doesn't much staying power , though . it wears off fairly quickly . but it lovely scent .	1
i intrigued when i saw amazon.com also sold body products such perfume make up . how you review scent convince people purchase it ? i can't exactly post scratch sniff pad online . i say this one my all time favorite perfumes . it smells summery , light , fresh refreshing , somewhat like happy clinique . scent also lasts few hours , unlike some other cheaper perfumes . bonus packaging beautiful : perfume comes wrapped slender white box piece rice paper describes flowers few different languages .	1
i love this , so my husband . i bought entire kit which comes lovely satin mini duffel-like purse handle.it includes body creme , body wash , perfume.it bit strong introduction.it doesnt smell like pine-sol like others said . its like re-vamping original poison purple bottle . except this one sweeter crisper tone.it becomes light stays fresh time.id say its bit fruity/floral . good everyday or special night out .	1
i am my second bar this stuff now , wow-there so much i say it ! first smell honestly awesome second , after only week use , i got all these " baby " hairs cropping out over my head-this awesome me since , though i'm not currently loosing my hair , i strong family history hair loss ! i also very oily hair-the kind hair needs washed every day or i look like i'm homeless but after using this shampoo i skip day and-for first time my life-you can't tell it my condition my hair !! my only issue this even though my scalp oily , my ends dry i use just tiny bit cream conditioner it-also this item dissolves super quick if you leave it shower makes everything your shower pink ... but other than i strongly recommend this item anyone curious	1
this product really brighten your eyes when used eye powder , amazing ! worth money !	1
this scent bit softer than many men fragrances . it unique powdery scent . i like how it not too strong overbearing one spray . just enough so my girl smell it when she hugs me or sits next me . i also use acqua di gio it good contrast this scent . i get compliments both scents	1
i am one these people who hates make up , i am natural , but this yet clinique line i love love love . this almost lipstick great . it not leave nasty lipstick everywhere . it stays lips not my teeth , glass or my boyfriend . i love almost lipstick . it great	1
i'm true product junkie . i've tried more crap spent more money stuff my colored , processed , blow dried , ironed , wavy damaged weak hair then any sane human would ... but i think i finally found my soulmate product ... first i must say it smells divine like mocha coffee ... i use this product daily before bed every night morning after i towel dry my hair .. it only product i leave my hair after shower whether i wear it naturally wavy or blow dry it straight ... sometimes i add ojon gloss serum if i feel my hair needs it ... little goes long way , my past bottom bra thick hair uses size tablespoon ... since using this product 2 weeks my hair significantly shinier , softer , way less frizz , no more puff not porous.my color also looks more vibrant which great b/c it blonde getting brassy . i noticed results right after 1st treatment . i especially love it good your hair purchase contributions helps tribe central america who gather oil their trees . =) it pricey but worth every cent then some . you can't put price true beauty right	1

i absolutely love clinique eye shadow . all their eye shadows go so smooth , never crease , just perfect shades colors my skin tone . almost peach color great because i use it highlighter under my brow or just base , either way i use it just every day ! :	1
within two days using this cream , i waa astonished results ! my skin tone completely evened out , my skin appeared smoother than it ever my life . it add glow . i'm not so sure tha it really works eliminating wrinkles , but other effects well worth every penny	1
this shower gel works really well -- you use it general soap , it very mild , so you use it anywhere ( ah hem .. ) your body without it stinging , or burning . i haven't tried it shampoo . works quite well shaving . good consistency . smells exactly like fresh banana . more fruity banana scent , like tropical lifesaver , than baked banana bread scent , if helps any . pricewise , this actually one more affordable upscale shower gels per ounce , assuming you buy large bottle just one scent . also , this stuff preserves very well . i still some philosophy eggnogg (!) shower gel i bought holidays , i now used it through 2 christmases it still smells great ..	1
clinique products , key knowing your skin type . i took quiz [ ... ] order decide which products buy 3step system results showed clarifying lotion #2 appropriate option . i little worried when i read reviews amazon.com said it too strong given some individuals rashes , but i used it anyway . it works beautifully . if you buy this lotion get rash or breakout it because you didn't consult clinique source or unaware your true skin type . so long you buy right products you , it going everything it promises more ... i highly recommend it	1
daring provocative , enigmatic mysterious , delicious perfume much say . dazzling its spicy heart notes , karan message seductive perhaps even troubling . way go donna karan ! 5 stars you	1
finally i found delicious , light , everyday scent . not heavy or over-powering , this refreshing apple scent great any day .	1

this purchased gift my son 14-yr-old girlfriend valentine day . heart shape container , well nice color lip gloss made it perfect gift her	1
it probably smaller than one inch cube so it isn't whole lot gloss , but key chain so it can't too big . very cute	1
this classic fragrance , not your overpowering j-lo , b'spears , etc . i wish i could explain scent ... but it tough describe . it isn't fruity or flowery . perhaps bit lavendar though ? basically , you don't overpower room it . it bit " old-world " -ness it ... but far i am concerned , wonderful thing . i am 31 year old professional , i wear it daily out night , i just love it	1
i bought this product three weeks ago i seen great improvements my skin already . i never really used skin products but i living florida over 20 years i lot spots due sun damage . friend mine told me this product his wife bought him . so , i decided give it try it really shown great results ! spots my skin diminishing my face looks better . i decided try some other menscience products . my wife also started using product , so you may buy two	1

i received this lip gloss few years ago christmas present , then i couldn't find it forgot it . but friend mine this using this same lip gloss couple weeks ago i remembered how great it . this one best lip glosses/balms i've ever used . flavor fantastic moisture it gives your lips unbeatable . it not sticky , it not even really noticeable . it very " natural beauty " if you know what i mean . :	1
i extremely oily skin . it wasn't unusual me wash my face three four times day keep it shining . result oily skin humid temps ( i live . georgia ) , makeup would just slide down my face i'd end up feeling like i stuck my head crisco end day . friend suggested clinique though oil isn't completely gone ... which wouldn't desireable anyways ... it finally manageable . i got ddm lotion part three step program clinique offers , but i think lotion solely responsible changes my skin . i could leave or take toner soap , which don't seem any different than less expensive versions readily available drugstores . lotion though ... wow ! it doesn't go greasy or watery . instead , it nice light consistency easy smooth over your skin but thick enough it not hard contain or control your fingertips . soon you rub it , you notice mattifying properties . lotion actually helps reduce shine itself , but without any tightness or depriving your skin its moisture . some stuff i've tried past only dried my skin out temporarily then oil glands would really start kick vengence , but this lotion i haven't any those problems . my skin now smoother than it ever , oil glands apparently appeased well because i haven't wash my face middle afternoons anymore .	1
this product really apply like butter very rich moisturizers . i using it years giving it christmas gifts . i use it very rich treatment dry legs , heels , elbows . i love fresh mango fragrance . before bed , i often cover my feet mango body butter , slip socks , let good stuff soak overnight . then i feel very pampered i wake up soft feet	1
it seems no one escape . there times when even best tressed need help their hair . sun , sand , surf may leave you many happy memories , but it also leave hair looking like ... well , let not talk it . perms , coloring , all intended make us look better - let face it , sometimes leave hair dry lusterless . time get serious shea butter . frederic fekkai moisturizing conditioner shea butter rich , creamy healing potion less than healthy locks . it truly hydrates , smells delicious , nourishes damaged hair . if your hair thick , it also marvelous detangler . only small amount needed - simply apply after shampooing comb through . what difference fekkai makes	1
i am believer now . i bought this because i saw demonstration qvc . i really needed great scrub since i use spray tan great exfloliator helps . i'm not sure what amazing grace really smells like , but i liked this smell . its not over-powering not over-perfumed . its got nice clean smell . i bottle expensive peter thomas roth scrub but find philosophy brand actually holds together you feel scrub . there no dripping . this truly great rough exfoliator . warming sensation , i didnt feel it . buy it sephora where you return it if you're not satisfied .	1
i alittle hesitant first ... this my first lush experience , but soon well rewarded . i thick , curly , long color treated hair . so say its damaged understatement . hybrid worked major tho . i doesnt lather like your normal shampoo , so i concerned if it really working . it ... no fear . i use quiet few swips tho , because how much hair i - but still - ive this bar month now , barely see where its used . i store mine traveling soap case always let dry before closing dont store shower . i still need condition afterwards , but not much normally . when dry ... my hair just feels healthier less frizzy , but not caked down .	1

all philosophy line , i find this best consistency-wise . it much thicker than amazing or baby grace gels , leaves your hair skin much softer , smelling like ivory soap . very clean scented , not too girly .	1
this bath bomb little deceptive . it fizzed fast made water beautiful color . it smelled great . then i thought , ok this enjoyable three minutes until i get used smell novelty bathing purple water wears off . boy , i wrong . after few minutes i started feel sooooo much more relaxed . i already bathing plain , hot water awhile , so it wasn't just effects hot bath . this little ballistic something . my skin smelled great until i took shower next morning .	1

i never problem acne until my late 20s , when suddenly my skin seemed turn me . i found myself bumps my cheeks ( where my skin dry ) , around my nostrils ( where my skin super red inflammed raw looking ) , my nose ( oily prone blackheads ) , my forehead ( also oily ) . i tried several high-end drugstore brands none them seemed work . months it this way no matter what i . i tried proactiv , which dried my skin out horribly , stung while i applied products - i even used those products only every other day my skin still peeled ! i all set go dermatologist when i decided give philosophy line chance after hearing so many good things it family friends . i've using it religiously two weeks , while i can't say my skin flawless , it considerably improved . bumps gone down every area , my nostrils no longer red unsightly , no more blackheads , best all it feels great while applying after . each product also very little scent it which i liked well - no antiseptic smell here ! i find moisturizer wasn't quite enough me so i started using philosophy hope jar sensitive skin my cheeks neck . fact it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely my reasons giving it four stars rather than five . overall , i've very satisfied product intend continue using it quite some time .	1

love all items laura mercier spring collection - sheer madness . " sheer " operative word here - makeup subtle , refined very flattering . stick gloss rates ten all a me . what not like lip treatment soothes , smooths , plus adds color fullness ? stick gloss combination lip balm , lip color , lip glaze - three one winner . my favorite colors peony , deep rose , poppy , festive crimson . when applied each color much sheerer than tube color indicates . instance , peony appears burgundy tone yet lips it lovely rose . perfect warm weather tones .	1
i've used others past , but they end up losing their concealment power short time , or end up making me look shinier . this one easy apply ( it like drawing your face ) it stays long time . i really love it . :	1
thanks coverage play sticks , ! coverage significant my emerging age spots , yet play sticks not look heavy , chalky or cakey all . using play sticks , my face looks like i am using little make up , it sheer look dewey finish . problelm : finding my color online shopping ! it out stock i don't live up north where department stores carry benefit !!!! it so worth effort ! i love this foundation , i tried regulars : bobbie brown , este lauder , clinique , etc	1

i've got pretty oily skin - i always . these my absolute favorite oil blotting sheets . i've tried wide assortment other brands , shiseido ones truly best . i really like light powder sheets . you know it absorbing without leaving tons make-up left your face . i detest those oil blotting sheets which " rubbery " . hopefully you know what i'm referrring . i don't feel like those sheets actually absorb anything - more like push oil around . after using this product you visably see all oil grime removed your face . i haven't found anything i like better than these . 5 stars	1
burberry london definitely compliment-getter . it also versatile , it worn any weather any outfit . it notes peach , black currant , vanilla , cedar . please not judge this scent only sniffing nozzle or smelling scent strip paper . it smells nothing like it skin . allow it settle 5 minutes , if it works your body chemistry , you'll know right away . :o ) first sprtiz , i get peachy/cedar blast quickly mellows into gorgeous , clean , but warm scent . vanilla isn't sweet all .. just warm inviting . i received lot compliments this . lasting power wonderful ! end day , it only sniffed anyone who gets close you , but it developed into super soft , clean vanilla . burberry london expensive , but there lots places where you find great deals it . bottle very sophisticated , simple , classy . try it !	1
i ash brown hair few blonde highlights found dark blonde/medium brown color very natural . i used sephora slanted eyeshadow brush apply very happy results . it so much better than lancome pencil i used use	1
i'm so glad finally came out this gloss . my sister got this gift set . i wanted my own ( just gloss ) i got it off ebay . this gloss smells like chocolate , color subtle , it makes your lips tingle . color doesn't last long i would like but my lips look great dolly they soft when i'm not using this	1
i purchased this conditioner after used fekkai color-treated ( pink one ) version thinking it would even better my high-lighted damaged hair . while it still fantastic conditioner compared most market , i really thought pink one better job . both leave my hair smooth relatively healthy , but my hair honestly gorgeous after using pink fekkai conditioner -- shiny , bouncy , like i never colored it . maybe this one little too heavy my hair ? i haven't quite figured out difference . previous posters noted , this rather strong smell -- sort floral , almond fragrance -- which little stronger than most hair products . i didn't find it particually off-putting , but i prefer clean , simple fragrance pink fekkai conditioner . all all , great product , but i'll go back my original fekkai conditioner when this one runs out . i never thought i would say this $20 tiny bottle conditioner , but it totally worth $$ . ( comparison purposes , i medium-length , straight , dirty blonde hair highlights )	1
i bought this my boyfriend , he thinning hair he said it made his hair feel thicker more attached . i love smell , i contstantly sniff his head now . also shipping really fast	1
i absolutely love this stuff ! i purchased it bare minerals starter kit ( foundation powders w/ dvd all ) because i wanted some color add foundation . i think it worth your money - actually you would save money rather than buying all items separately . it nice you get your eye , cheek lip products all one kit . i particularly like buxom lips stuff can't get enough it ! it so minty , tingly leaves light shimmer . clear radiance great ! i use it blusher , if i wet it it makes great eye shadow base . eyeshadow brush fabulous ! i like how there two ends - one eyeliner , other shadow , although i also use eyeliner brush eyeshadow . gold glimmer great if you wet it comes stronger . my only concern it get messy - particularly onyx color which comes strong so only use very little . otherwise i think it great buy !	1
despite what britney spears might mean you , this one sexy perfume . it smells hot . all girls should wear this	1
i saw this local dept . store , quite intrigued unique packaging , name . i sprayed myself tester bottle , loved it , straightaway ! my hubby got it me valentine day , i use it faithfully . it fresh , crisp , green apple aroma it . not too light , yet not too overpowering . perfect balance . very girly . reminds me walk apple orchard , autumn day . good way get your apple-a-day	1
yes , this just water , but packaged wonderfully . i very dry , sensitive skin , little evian spritzers ( i carry one me all time winter ) help immeasurably . i spray little before moisturizing , or when my skin flaking . i always take these planes -- spritz my face every two hours -- find this keeps my skin drying out becoming too oily ( reaction dryness ) long flights . some reviewers scoffed this product , pointing out it just water speculating brand name draw . i don't drink evian water very often ( i prefer other brands , if i'm drinking bottled water ) , if i could find comparable product i would definitely try it out . similar products , like body shop face mists , tend scented irritate my ( very sensitive ) skin ( exception this face spritz boots botanical line , but hard find outside uk ); i've considered just getting spray bottle putting regular water it , but those tend larger , more forceful sprayers i don't want point one my face . evian brumisateur , you're getting just water , but that all you need ; it conveniently packaged , lasts long time such small bottle , i love way it feels . highly reccomended ( thank goodness they're carry-on approved , if you buy small size !	1
i love this fragrance but even when i layer falling love body wash , body lotion perfume spray , it seem fade lot faster than other perfumes . falling love really great scent so when i wear it - i continue refresh scent occasional spritz throughout day .	1

" marinating " oil not what you might imagine " oil " . it penetrates hair , treats scalp , smells really good ( very subtle ) doesn't feel heavy . it easy leave all night , washes out so quickly it instant gratification - beautiful hair . leave it great skin care company apply beneficial treatment properties hair care . this marinating oil also multi-tasks me . i use tiny bit rub it into my cuticles nails . i use few drops tame frizz before i use my flat-iron . i've rubbed few drops onto my hands feet when i've felt extra-dry . this good stuff ! i highly praise this product . this not just random addition confusing mass hair care lines . this serious * treatment * won't put shelf rest " things i've tried " . it worth it . i actually love my hair again . my color lasts longer , doesn't fade , shine just won't quit . it taken years years damage away . i blow-dry , flat-iron , curl ... without fry-factor . shampoo conditioner last forever . little really go long , long way . thank you again philosophy , you've yet let me down .	1

clinique " pore minimizer instant perfector " indeed change appearance your skin . it incredibly light , just touch glides your pores disappear instant . you wear it alone or under regular make-up even more coverage . i really think this great product it just what it says it . i recommend you use it no more than light moisturizer or else it won't able get your pores work its magic	1
not everyone wants smell sexy i guess , which why i caved gave 5 starts delicious smell ... no one mentioned this but overall smell reminds me coconut . i recognize this perfume other people it always distracts me ( good way ) . i would not wear this myself though . best winter .... it'd annoying spring/summer . now perfume which person not wear yet still give it 5 stars got something special :) . only one other perfume me , amairage i think ... would never wear it , but i enjoy smell others	1

i browsing bath body works store saw it , opened up " tester " bottle it smelled devine ! i know it pricey , but i thick , straight hair recently become very oily , even though i not use any products . first day i used it , i washed my hair blow dryed it , thinking smell would not last long . wrong ! it happened raining day when my hair would get wet , nice apple smell came back . my hair very soft bouncy . i purchased 18 oz bottle ( yes , sure pricey ) so far i've used it every day ( week ) . i try taper off maybe 3 days week , order conserve product . it keeper	1
this first foundation i ever bought actually matched my skin color exactly . i seriously can't see it all my skin ! it goes velvety smooth isn't greasy all , after minute or two , it feels totally natural , soft matte finish . i don't even use powder it set it . my only complaint very light sheer , so it doesn't really cover up lot flaws ( i freckles around my mouth it doesn't cover ) , but it works fine little concealer . i haven't noticed much way line reduction all , either , i'm sorry say . but still good foundation itself	1
i usually add salts bath oil my baths well bubbles add skin softening properties .... but this bubble bar , i don't !! it pink , it smells so good , water bubbles feel so soft against my skin !! i absolutely love this one ~ i tried many , lush brand others ~ so much i got rock star soap matching scent . i say , however , i found it necessary keep it fridge during summer months although it arrives solid-i live florida so humidity makes it soften bit more than i'd like cabinet . overall ? 20 stars !	1
you won't find these unusual nail colors any other brand nail polish . these colors long-lasting , durable , offer great shine	1

this most invigorating facial/skin product i ever purchased . it gentle enough use your face leave it polished smooth ( note : use only once week if you dry skin ! ) . if you've long day work , or mall x-mas shopping all day , grab ocean salt scrub . rub it all over your feet instant foot massage don't forget rub your hands , well ! you soon decide this lush product you cannot live without ..	1

most masks made clay seem dry out so fast you hardly time put them your face before you need wash them off . they also only seem serve one purpose , drying out your skin or removing oil . there some leave your face feeling nourished this one healing clay masks . i sensitive skin tendancy towards either dry or oily - guess it lovely combination skin problem . so , this mask seems deal both issues once - removing dry skin deeply cleansing pores . mask magnaminty made bentonite , water , kaolin , honey , phaseolus angularis seed powder , evening primrose seeds , peppermint oil , flower extracts , vanilla fruit extract chlorphyllin-copper complex . this fun use bath or shower while you shaving . put it few minutes , let it dry slightly then rub off dead skin cells . seeds provide exfoliating power . almost immediately upon looking mirror after leaving tub , i could tell this mask healing powers . dreamwash , my skin looked especially cleansed calmed . i recommend both you if you need skin brightening calming . these two products seemed work well together create radiant complexion . you may also want try prince shaving cream dream bath bomb . figs leaves soap also very moisturizing . ~ rebecca review p.s. if you find someone rub this all over your back , it feels so good easy wash off yourself later ( unlike some clay masks i've tried ) .	1
i bought this lush product due high reviews other lushies couldn't wait get home try it . when i opened pot , first thing i noticed color - it little turn-offish , but don't let stop you slathering your entire face it . smell amazing not too minty or strong . like previous review said below , it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream . i put mask all over my face ( you put it your neck back well ) , lie down 15 minutes get full spa feel , then wash it off shower warm water . i find it much easier shower because when mask dries , it takes some rubbing get it off . when mask , your face tingles mint feels so refreshing ! when mask rinsed off , your skin feels even better . great cleanser exfoliator one ! sure keep eye out ' best ' date because this only shelf life 4 months	1

this day-time fragrance i can't live without . i'm type person who doesn't like things smelling too florally or girly-girl ( e.g paris hilton or maria sharpova fragrances , which don't suit me all ) . same time , i don't want something that too " mature " leaving me smelling like old lady ( too strong musky ) . eau des merveilles somewhat in-between fragrance that hard describe very unusual . it woodsy but it amber , pepper , citris notes . it refreshing , modern , chic . you don't need overspay this stuff either . it potent you'll probably mistaken wearing cologne if you overkill it . people like how i smell this fragrance , some even say i smell like " clean laundry , " which good thing ( me atleast ) . you should try this stuff sephora or fragrance dealer before buying it though . people body chemistrys ( amount perspiration , oil production , foods they eat , etc . ) make perfumes smell differently . spray it seell it after few hours .	1

time come - time some serious reassessment my skin toll time elements taken it . i'd read ads lancome line - absolue - which stated it " one product addresses effects chronological aging .

" she right ! i went back get more ( several months later ) , sephora no longer carries this brand . luckilly , i found it here . bubbles fragrance long lasting , no harsh chemicals or greasy residue left bathtub . fragrance nice but not overhwelming . bubbles full lasting ... they won't end up mound your feet . somehow , they're distributed all throughout bath water ... just waiting you slide ! you don't need use lot bubblebath , which good .. because price .... but even small amount , you'll tub full bubbles !!! enjoy !!	1
it hard find perfect skin products , but this one flawless my opinion . it not heavy or greasy goes skin just perfectly . i tend sensitive/combination skin now use this treatment everyday . i strongly recommend it	1
i fekkai product , loved it so much i wanted take look what else dear frederic offer . i've always wanted product would put waves my hair , but every one i tried before just made my hair stiff , crunchy , icky looking ! i read good reviews this product , so i decided give it try . it amazed me ! my hair really doesn't much natural wave- maybe one or two semi-waves back . frankly , if i leave my hair air-dry without doing anything it , it looks like cave-woman hair ! but not this stuff ! i towel dried my hair until it just damp . then i sprayed it all over my hair , flipped my head over scrunched . ( if your hair tends get frizzy , you may want add little cream- such fekkai glossing cream- this product doesn't much combat frizz ) then i blow-dryed low just minute or two while scrunching , let rest air-dry . i few pieces hair front quite damaged coloring , waves weren't defined there . but rest my hair- wow ! i never imagined such fun waves my relatively straight hair ! frederic fekkai genius !	1
get dramatic look extend your lashes three times their natural length this mascara . it doesn't irritate comes off easily night	1
i got it , i love it . simple . i little suprised there wasn't much lather , but it get my very thick hair clean . upon further thought i took reading ingredients again , it mostly all natural stuff . kinda makes wonder what rx bought stuff ??? try it , yes , it fragrant but i like it . however , it could overpowering some , especially if you over sensitive sents	1
i skeptical first . i mean , shampoo/conditioner bar ? i haven't super impressed lush other solid shampoos or conditioners ( least , not enough write review , good or bad ) , so i doubtful this 2-in-1 bar . but i loved idea , i curious , so i bought it i must say godiva far surpassed my hopes ! my hair shoulder length , it only took 6 or 7 good swipes wet hair work up incredible lather ! ( 3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough , 10 too much ! )my hair felt clean , but not styrofoam-squeaky clean where * everything * stripped your hair . conditioner light , but doesn't really kick until your hair dries . i don't personnally recommend using hair dryer , so i don't know how would affect conditioner , but air drying worked great me . i also recommend it travel since it size your palm , 2-in-1 , won't leak ! ( only warning i'd give shampoo tin . i got it free , so maybe i shouldn't complain , but ... let shampoo bar dry before putting it into tin !!! it pain get it out if you don't . ) i also love scent , but could too strong some people ( or not strong enough ) . everyone different , but if you don't live near lush store , you'll never know until you buy it ! :	1
i don't know why so many reviews say they get six or seven shaves . aren't you using hot shaving soap ? i average european beard . i shave shower each day mug soap bristle brush . key . i get good hot lather going . lather just keep your whiskers wet soft . using merkur blade , i get well over fifteen or twenty shaves .... or more . i don't really keep count , but one blade lasts me least four weeks , i shave daily . i reluctantly change blades when it seems it bit dull .. but i think i could use it much longer ... honest . i can't imagine spending three dollars multiblade razor good seven days . love my merkur razor , too	1
fragrances marvelous , yet after shower they not interfere your scent choice . i find shower gel very creamy not drying all . i use it well shampoo , but found dry harsh winter i still need conditioner . i highly recommend this product	1
entire line fabulous , but rose zircon lip gloss far best . i never one wear lipstick , but since i first tried this lip plumping gloss , i rearly leave home without it . it doesn't feel like you wearing anything , yet it stays while eating drinking . rose zircon matches my lips all my friends who borrowed it not returned it because they love it so . it just makes me feel glamorous	1
it shiny ? oh yes , it . my hair dull boring after week using this shampoo , it shiny lustrous . like magic . i scared use solid shampoo but all you rub wet bar top wet head lather form	1
smell only caveat me , it little bit sour/bitter/funky smelling . thing i find strange i use alot this feel like i've saturated my skin . i go through it pretty quickly compared other spray type toners . whole hauschka regimen so amazing my skin . use , spritz after cleansing press gently into skin	1
i stated my other reviews , i color-treated otherwise normal hair which wavy prone frizz . i like this shampoo it calming effect , best experienced after couple uses . if you straighten your hair , this work great because shine smoothness most noticable . those you worried your boss may think you spent your lunch break pub - stout scent fades quick only really identifyable while washing . word wise , this shampoo bit drying . i make sure deep condition least once week avoid crispy hair .	1
i love this exfoliating cleanser , especially way my face feels after using it . i even used it my feet .... remarkable ! i love every murad product i tried .. but this sure one my favorites	1

while it seems these days most shampoos specific purpose ( ie- volumizing , de-frizzing , curl-enhancing , color-protecting , etc . ) this one amazing all-around shampoo , wonderful daily use all types , colors styles hair . smell incredible - truly invigorating wake up morning shower . it doesn't leave any buildup or residue many shampoos often , so you don't worry switching your shampoo every few weeks . its great classic which i hope stays around forever- i'll remain loyal fan !	1
i don't like liquid eye shadows because they seem wear off but thisstayed all night all colors pretty it also worked great liner under my bottom eyelashes . i don't care wand it goopy i used eyeliner brush apply . also little goes long way	1
this stuff goes easy , stays well ( but rub off water , won't withstand good cry ) . nice . not quite nice victoria secret liner ( i swear stuff , discontinued 3-4 years ago ) , but way better than anything cheaper . i tried other things . plus , won't irritate my very sensitive eyes	1
i received smaple size this face creme my recent order my hunny anniversary present estee lauder . it came bunch other stuff i either swapped or gave away , but this real winner me . it came 5-day supply , i just wish i more . i used this creme supplement other lotions i wasn't thrilled , namely , neutrogena whip moisturizer spf 15 or 30 , clinique super city block spf 40(but i'm still undecided this one ) . both these weren't smooth enough . they didn't nice slip spread easily across skin . former i use lot its owen really moisturize lower half my face , latter i rub very hard order get it spread without this creme . i love this creme gets job . out all moisturizers i used my face , i use this one most sparingly order moisturize , i like . i imagine it coests more than other two moisturizers , but it also better job . i don't like when i first put it , it seems warm up my face bit around nose mouth . ordinarily this wouldn't bother me , but seeing how almost every other thing breaking me out recently , it makes me teensy bit paranoid . howver , this sensation not persist , so i don't worry too much it . other thing it takes alittle longer sink into skin , until it , it gives my skin look if i sweating , but then it my skin just feels good . isn't what moisture all ? recommended : yes amount paid ( us$) : gwpskin compatibility : improved my skinfragrance : pleasing scent	1
i'm usually drugstore mascara girl -- my current fave maybelline full soft -- but i opportunity pick this up cheap , so i decided try it . immediately , i liked thinner-sized tube ( can't stand those overly fat mascaras ! ) stiff-bristled brush . product bit dry side , but i much prefer wet gloppy . there wasn't too much product brush , it easy apply . i definitely noticed lengthening effect beyond what i've seen any other mascara , which great because it made my small eyes look much more open . also , product stayed put all day long , absolutely no smudging or flaking . my only slight disappointment it left my lashes looking bit thin , effect long spidery ; i guess i'm used fullness i get my everyday mascara , full soft . i continue use definicils times when i particularly want more length , i've found i layer it my full soft get both length fullness i want . i would repurchase this if i could get it discount again , but i would not pay full price	1
deep clover votiva nicest aroma any candle i sampled . it not over-powering yet it job . it warm , sensual fragrance	1
i don't know what i would without this mascara !! this mascara me beyond best i ever used , ( i my share investments other brands mascara only sadly disappointed ) . i would give this product 10 stars if amazon would let me . i confess i carry this mascara me everywhere ( not you re-touch up during day -- because you dont , but just so i won't ever lose it ) . truly product worth trying .	1
i got this my boyfriend , who works all day lifting heavy plants nursery . he loved it minute i applied it his sore back . smell calming , spices warm up sore muscles like icy-hot patch , but much better . it melts easily into skin , but lasts long time . it feels so creamy warm . now he always begs me give him massage	1
i bought solution 2 roller ball it works very well . refill amazing deal i love this product	1
normally our house , we threaten wash cats ( they don't like water too much normally only peer curiously into bathroom when i'm tub . now then they played bubbles ) , but this amusing name . i think it more like " honey , i lost soap tub again . " this one melting dream soap easily slip away into depths luxurious lush bath . this soap good think pink bath bomb some creamy candy bath bubble bar . if you love this , you may simply faint when you order sultana soap ( oh my ! ) . avowash ( avocado olive oil ) , ooh la la ( lavender ) bohemian ( lemon ) also fun . ~ rebecca review	1
loved scent feel this soap ! i'm bath product junkie my latest cravings anything honey scented this soap wonderful . my only complaint it use up pretty quickly left mess dish . i'd not leave it shower next time .	1
if you tried such products proactiv help clear up your breakouts haven't impressed , try this line murad products .

my mother bought this perfume me two christmases ago . first i thought it too heavy . however , once i started wearing it i fell love it . i've never received so many compliments perfume my life . men women randomly stop me hallways , restaurants , street ti ask me what i am wearing . " you smell so good ... " i wear it everyday now am my third bottle .	1
every time i wear amor amor lots people ask me what i'm wearing . it my absolute favorite fragrance i got great deal it . thanks , annett	1
so true this product . i admit when i first saw price tag this product , it half out curiousity i purchased . i mean could pair $20 tweezers much better than ole $1.75 or $3 pairs home ? well if your asking yourself question , yes ! these things amazing grip pull tinyiest hairs . things you would dig normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw . without doubt , you get your moneys worth this product well amazed their performance . it type " wow " makes you feel like , " how i ever get without these before " . worth every penny i'll never buy cheap tweezer again . these lasted years still retain their fine point .	1
tweezerman really best tweezers market say , cutest . different colors choose , fact they're reliable strong only adds them . tweezers gone dull you need them sharpened ? you don't need go store anymore buy new ones . tweezerman sharpens them free charge sh so long you send envelope . my final point : i don't see point buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair it lasts you rest your life	1
i am definitely beauty junkie . i tried probably every volumizing product market ( including much lauded phyto volumizer ) but i absolutely love love love this kerastase product so much ! it far best ! it leaves your hair silky smooth tons volume ( even after blowdrying it 15 minutes ) . it doesn't leave behind gummy or sticky residue . it little expensive but it lot bang its buck i would even pay more it if i . i never use anything else again !	1
i really long hair i use lot conditioner . this good treatment winter when my naturally blonde hair starts grow out bit darker than my summer haircolor . it doesn't lighten hair very dramatically all its own , but it conditions very well smells really nice , like lemony custard . i use this warming it slightly microwave so it sinks better , then applying it dry hair . i tie my hair into bun wait twenty minutes or so , then rinse it gently , wash my hair using blonde shampoo , condition light conditioner . if you don't really want your hair lightened much just want bit extra shine highlight your blonde hair , this great its own . if you want more dramatic effect , blonde solid conditioner works stronger effect . blonde drying though so i like use them together	1
it delightful remind spring , daises true love during cold dreary winter months . i love using this set while traveling , bring back home memories make it easier away .	1
i've fan roger et gallet soap ever since i went paris late 1970 . products world class just thing make one feel like king	1

i rabid fan lush products years , often them shipped me form canada before they so easy buy states . each product certain earthy quality it its nice knowing people who make each every single these luscious concoctions love them much customers it shows ! karma soap looks like slab gold shape but really reminiscent candied carrots i would find fruit cakes i used eat kid growing up poland . clarity fiery jewel like color quite attractive it makes nice soap put guest bathroom or self spoiling hand made soaps beat other cookie cutter types mile . scent itself breezy breath citrus mother earth embedded deep core . lavender patchouli whisper , shadowy backbone zest freshness . multidimensionality layering scents makes fore very uplifting experience i smell heady aromas every time i my hands it . i also love karma perfume , which smells almost exactly soap . i find my hands don't get dry when i use this glycerin soap opposed regular soaps laden chemicals lards . but i always use hand cream afterwards , preferably one those gooey burt bees creams come heavy glass jars . my hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry air or how cold it when i used lush soaps good hand cream . - kasia .	1
i make my own hand body soaps , so i'm pretty picky anything store bought . i given this sample order lush , i loved it instantly ! i haven't able duplicate smell exactly my own soaps , so i am willing buy it just alone . i'm not fan patchouli general , but it doesn't smell strong this soap . it blends very well other scents smells divine ! my entire bathroom smells great when it hung up drying shower . i highly recommend it even given others karma gifts , too	1
this cologne smells great ! it much more appealing than chanel allure sport , versace blue jeans , or ralph lauren polo . if you like slightly stronger , sophisticated scent , this great option	1
i initially bought sympathy skin because smell ( i just love it ! ) reviews i've read . i really excited get home try it , but little disappointed . lotion smelt wonderful , but when i used it , my hands felt like lotion didn't really sink it . sympathy skin left slight shinny coat my hands felt little oily . first i realized i using too much , so i started use less really cut back oiliness . since i use this night time , it not big deal , but i wouldn't use this day cream because it little heavy me . besides oiliness , lotion work well really helped moisturize my hands , which usually dry cracked because so much dishwashing . i follow lush lemony flutter cuticle butter my hands never looked better . try some lush other lotions first before i buy this again . overall good product	1

this scent very light sugary . i enjoyed it because i prefer fragrances more spice-based than floral-based , this scent note sugared almonds stands out me most . it good summer scent because it isn't too heavy it very sweet . i gave this four out five stars because while it enjoyable , it just didn't certain ' something ' makes fragrance truly memorable	1
i love this ! it powdery , clean smell isn't overpowering- but even if it , i could probably stand smell it all day long ! i used maybe 1/4 bar , but it still made nice masses bubbles ! unfortunately , bubbles disintegrated pretty quickly ... i didn't mind though , didn't feel it worth taking off star , because it left my water scented my skin soft . this something i wish i could use every bath	1

all i say wow . i'm 24 . my first razor same kind de razor my dad used ( some gillette ) . around 17 mach 3 came out since full knowledge shaving never really handed down me , i opted mach 3 which easy use gave decent shave . i've essentially stuck mach 3 until now , but generally unsatisfied closeness my shave i decided investigate turned back safety razor picking up this merkur hd . i just used it first time it turned out significantly more satisfying than i hoped it would . i nicked myself few times without really noticing so there some learning curve but now i've only used it once i tell you it won't take long get it down . couple thoughts : 1 ) i'm really glad i went hd . i thought hd may heavy ( it may compared other de razors ) but i wouldn't want it any lighter . it already feels light my hand . 2 ) biggest thing keep mind shave razor cuts keeping it perpendicular your skin . most notable difference shaving mach 3 . merkur hd centered around this . mach 3 i kind feel like i drag blade across my skin ( kind scraping it ) get close shave ( which i don't notice much irritation ) . said most shave hd close , but since aim keep blade perpendicular , razor felt more like it gliding over skin . very nice . 3 ) put new blade you unscrew bottom top part comes off . you pop blade , put top back screw bottom tighten top . it should noted i've started shaving night so i tell what i'm doing ( i'm not morning person ) so morning if i'm not really going pay attention mach 3 may still better . also , i'm using cheap soap boar brush cvs until stuff i ordered comes so any luck it even nicer next time	1

this soap awesome . what i like it it doesn't sweet scent it . fact , you really sniff it smell it . it leaves your hands feeling super clean hydrated , if you just put light lotion ( but without feeling something " " your hands ) . what i not like this soap it leaves reddish-brown film after you use it . i buy special soap holder ( one little " pillars " hold soap up so it doesn't touch surface ) so it wouldn't make mess . i really like this soap , though . it winter , i like anything keep my hands smooth soft without use lotion	1

i've only used this twice so far ( last night this morning ) but already i've noticed my skin not oily it really soft after i rinse it off . i'm intrigued entire lush product line - glad i stumbled upon this . i've got some samples way ( won off auction site ) i can't wait try them . also , this seller awesome when ups some reason thought i moved . when i called lush live person answered phone called ups me . ups called me within 30 minutes offered bring it out night . wonderful !! my skin oily lg pores blackheads - go ahead give this try if this sounds like your skin . only drawback it little messy side but not too bad	1
i dont know what they put it , i just know it works . within three days getting this product chicago lush store , my face cleared up beautifuly . i've really awful skin , blackheads , whiteheads , deep cystic acne , since i around 14 , i've tried anything i could get my hands take care it ( proactive , everything else ) i problem finding product would clean up my super oily skin without irritating it because its very very sensitive . this trick beautifuly ( followed up some celestial mosturizer after some hardcore exfoliation ) made my face feel very soft smooth after washing instead all itchy flakey . my pores also looked noticably smaller well . plus it smells great	1
this super-rich bath those very dry skin . melt basically oils , luscious scent , some soaping or foaming agents make oils disperse into bathwater not float top like they would otherwise . it sometimes little too rich my skin , but i love scent so i use it occasionally anyway just rinse off afterwards some rock star soap . scent lovely rock star scent , vanilla-y candy scent kids also love .	1

while sephora looking new nars lipstick , pretty dior rep approached me . i would normally declined her offer mini-make-over , but i feeling rather adventurous wanted update some my make-up items , so i followed her her chair where she went work me . i say , past , i nonplussed unimpressed makeovers like these . but when rep handed me mirror , i gasped . even under harsh lighting , my complexion looked pretty darn flawless youthful grandmother trying hold any vestige good looks . i bought foundation , finishing powder few other dior goodies . i figured i would probably use it few times realize it didn't really look good me home or office it when dior rep my makeup store . then i would experience buyer remorse continue my quest perfect foundation . lucky me , i wrong . this product become one my top choices foundation . it doesn't settle fine lines around my eyes , or my pores . instead , it what it says -- smooths out my complexion . color chosen me looks natural no lines demarcation . coverage what i prefer this stage my life . i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because i am still searching this type lush coverage gives my combo skin less shine mid-day . but now , i finish using bottle , probably purchase , which something i haven't other foundations some time . my biggest tip this foundation little goes long way . dior rep used make-up brush tends give more sheer , even coverage . $50 , it wouldn't seem bargain , but if you use it i've described , it should last you several months .	1
walking through airport security just last week , i stopped tsa employee who asked " who wearing cologne ?! " i said " not me !

although it great others love this product , i not get same streak good luck . i using clinique years , merely because it affordable lot people i knew used it . however , every time i took pictures i couldn't help but cringe after i saw way my face looked . i'm naturally tan person , but when i wore clinique foundation ( i used honey 07 ) it would make my face look extremely pale ghostly , compared rest my body . it got point where i got so upset i went back clinique counter macy insisted this just couldn't right color me . they insisted it correct color didn't even bother trying new shades me , even though i gone back couple different times . overall , i really miserable this product . lady , i want look my best . i definitely don't want look like someone who doesn't know how put her makeup , but whenever i took pictures saw way i looked , i couldn't help but think everyone thinking . those you who may my same problem , i recommend switching over laura mercier . i made switch it best makeup decision my life . my face never looked better	-1
this only lush product thus far i've absolutely hated . smell this downright revolting it doesn't anything my hair . try retread ( my favourite lush conditioner ) , veganese or even american cream over this one	-1
this soap washed really well , but after i rinsed it off , it felt like my skin soapy film over it . it also made my skin feel " stipped " . i not really like this soap instead recommend basis facial products instead	1
i this gloss carney . while i like color , gloss very gooey gloppy it doesn't stay long all . i would not buy it again	1
i found strivectin-sd eye cream nicely textured cream , but it too heavy my skin . this rather strange , i dryish skin around my eyes like heavier eye cream . this one clogged up my orbital area so much i got millia ( which i never suffered before ) . cream not absorb very well , but feels good touch . terms wrinkles , i 0 effect . i my late 20 am strating notice first crow feet . strivectin-sd nothing alleviate them . i express opinion price though . if you like product it works you , price should not issue , tube lasts forever . i used it 6 months easily am now getting concerned eye products should thrown away after such long time . yet it hasn't run out yet . i give it 2 out ot 5 - nice texture . impressive advertising campaign convinced me try it !	1
i received vanilla grapefruit sticks gift one my boys . sticks very thin only burn halfway down entire length . re-lighting useless bc there no fragrance left bottom half stick burn . scent doesn't remind me vanilla grapefruit- more like plain burning sticks , which won't cost you $13 . votivo candles well , but aromatic sticks leave something desired . not worth money .	1
love when amazon deletes all reviews product ! well , this one used 3 five-star ratings . i added my two cents- this product nothing me whatsoever . so , some people love it . i don't get it . , it pretty much opposite anti-oxidant , so doesn't make sense . i pointed this out my review . wonder if vendors choice delete all reviews if they get one bad enough ? also , it listed $45 amazon well . same supplier . huh	-1

i chi turbo ( 1 " ) , but i got worried after reading some reviews it unreliable . so part reason i wanted buy t3 iron it comes 4-year comprehensive warranty . other difference solid-ceramic plates " infused " tourmaline which i found intriguing . 1-3/8 " wide plates perfect width my long-ish hair . ( i've used 2 inch wide iron , which i found harder maneuver . ) it heats up fast , stays hot . it great job gripping hair without snagging . my hair stays silky straight all day , not feel damaged after while , like it cheaper irons i've used past . thing this iron other irons not well - it really curls . it heat vents sides plates lets you curl your hair twisting it near root pulling it through ( different usual method gripping ends strands then winding up ) . it creates springy curl better than any flat iron i've used . ( however , heating vents make exterior iron hotter touch . so there drawback this function . ) overall , i enjoy using this flat iron . very happy this purchase . eta : i've learned hairart not honor warranty unless you buy it authorized distributor ( e.g. , sephora ) . so you might want check before you place your order	1

rock star soap appeals my playful side scent this soap leaves one little giddy . sweet vanilla fragrance blended perfumes result something like spicy vanilla strawberry milkshake . i say yum ? this absolutely delish i think they may added little cinnamon mix . i love keeping lush soaps sink because they don't seem dry out my hands much gel soaps . this one perfect combination smitten hand cream . rock star soap left me dreaming buying other " vanilla " themed items like think pink ( which i tried ) , creamy candy ( bubble bar ) , sympathy skin ( which i'm dying try ) honey trap ( which i just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart ) . candy fluff sounds like it would go well this experience . if you love this soaps creamy consistency , gratuitous violets , sultana soap alkmaar impress . any chance vanilla toothpaste listed here soon ? wish , wish ... ~ rebecca review	1

this pur minerals starter kit great introduction this brand . i am absolutely love 4-in-1 pressed mineral makeup ( included kit ) . it so much better than bare escentuals makeup , which i using years . 4-in-1 provides great coverage , it foundation , concealer , spf 15 pressed powder all one . bare escentuals , i buy mineral veil , foundation concealer all separately , i still felt like my dark circles blemishes not covered well . pur minerals wonderful makeup , very lightweight , even brush soft my skin ! i highly recommend it	1

now let get its effectiveness out way so we talk love it or hate it scent ! it really thick conditioner works great every other day or every few days . i really long hair this tames it smoothes my split ends , it leaves my hair shiny . it isn't greasy all . if you used drugstore or salon conditioners , don't judge effectiveness any natural conditioner month . how long it take silicones mainstream conditioners leave your hair ( silicones all those things conditioner end " cone " , like dimethicone , etc ) . detoxing your hair off silicones well worth it though , my hair much healthier shinier without buildup . so scent : it green , kind melon fresh , hint violet ( like bathos , gratuitous violets , daddyo ) it . it took some getting used , when i first got it i thought it smelled green beans or some vegetable-like smell . but when you use it rinse it out , you left rich green scent , tiniest hint gently floral violet . it isn't everybody , but if you buy it , give it chance work its magic your hair before you make your judgement , because lovely violetty smell combined how well it works makes it kind addictive . i use it daddyo shampoo enhance hint violet fresh green scent i get it . i use it rotation american cream which bit lighter	1

i don't excessively oily skin , but i've never able wear mascara without smudging . waterproof , smudgeproof , expensive , drugstore , you name it i've tried it . every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours . i'd given up mascara completely , but thought i'd try one more time this ( money back guarantee spalook , what risk ? )this mascara lives up it name smudge-proof . even wearing sunscreen my under-eye area , it doesn't transfer . even 100+ deg phoenix heat , it stays . i * love * it this reason . it also comes off easily night ; no problems there . however , i'm giving it only 4 stars because it flake little throughout day . not lot , not enough make me stop using it ( first truly smudge-proof mascara i've found ) , but it there . since it advertised smudge flake-proof , i can't give it full 5 stars	1

i bought this after using other murad products loving them . i like this , but i wouldn't say i love it . first , it bit overpriced . i get comparable drugstore product fraction price . toner itself decent , but doesn't seem clean deeply other toners . however , those who find toners bit harsh , this may good option . non-drying doesn't toner " burn " . overall , decent product , but not one i am sure i would re-purchase	1

chisel brush works well all-over . actually , it better than - it swept over everything my skin without depositing powder unevenly . that rare brush . usually you spend some time sponge or fingertips blending , but not this . light cream powder , named 4-in-1 foundation , provides excellent coverage without thick . ( thick powder base terrible - it always looks like you dunked your face bowl flour ! ) my freckles still there , but my skintone more even . this stuff concealer , foundation , powder , spf protection . awesome . so much easier than doing everything separately ! no oil , talc , alcohol , fragrance , chemical dyes , or preservatives , but what it vitamin shea butter . universal marble powder spreads into tint looks fairly natural - sun-kissed perhaps . it need darkening darker powder - least me . but only touch . mineral glow didn't go dark it looked either . i actually kind surprised this one - most dark powders end up everywhere if you try shade them out ... or impressively dark one location if you don't . this wasn't like all , though i think i'd like darker color eyeshadow accents . some mascara ... eyeliner ... .. .. .	1

diorskin airflash very easy apply , gives light matte finish wonderfully evens out skin tone . once applied , it very lightweight- you can't feel it your skin all . not much needed , however , there barely any product . i used it off month , perhaps 15 applications my estimation , bone dry after . $60 , this unacceptable ! i wasn't piling it or anything , i would just light mist over my nose cheek area . if this half price , i would give it 5 stars , it really great product , but mostly filled compressed air , i hard time shelling out kind cash	1

i haven't outbreak acne 5 years until i started using this cream . i kept using it thinking my huge cysts couldn't possibly this very pricey stuff . i went dermo she said stay away these thick creams specifically anti-aging because they horrible your skin . i went back my cheap neutrogena lotion anti- aging it felt sooo much better lighter within week my skin cleared up . i didn't even realize how very thick this stuff until i started back my neutrogena . i feel so bad $$$ i lost i wish i would've gotten sample first . i encourage you same .	-1
i bought this eyeliner expecting great things , sorely disappointed . application difficult , mistakes almost impossible correct even if immediately , i can't soften line ( it * * smudgeproof ) . if you used brush-on-liquid-liner , very steady hand , want dramatic look , this might work you . i prefer softer line , so this didn't . also , it almost completely flaked off over course day . i'm giving it two stars because it really smudge-proof , no sliding or transferring . i didn't dark shadows smudging but i flakes , so i'm still not happy i t.t his definitely not worth pricetag	1
i used entire tube faithfully face cream over course several months . while i thought it moisturized fine , i not notice any change my lines , tone , texture . money i'd go get several tubes neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better , nicer texture smell much better	1

after great success merkur classic i decided own up get futur . i super excited because i thought myself , " shoot , one pass instead two ... " not quite . starters razor bulking plain heavy . not kind heavy i'm comfortable trying shave i shouldn't feel i might drop darn thing . i started 1 first day get handle razor . not good shave , missed alot spots patches hair . so day two i went level 2 razor . same story , second verse . it left patches didn't shave well some areas . 2.5 areas got smaller but still ... they there . went 3 setting razor almost mangled myself . so next week i went back 2.5 it more consistantly , still gave me crappy shave . i give this one star because if it supposed better razor than anything before it , there shouldn't learning curve one double edge . least not one this severe . i get way better shave using my merkur classic i really think least me , this way go . i say use caution merkur futur . i also say if you're already getting good shave double edge you , don't buy new style sake buying new style . if you're double edge gets old ... buy new one same kind . only suggestion .	-1
i love cinnamon buns shower gel , so i thought i would try lip gloss . one thing , it smells/tastes nothing like cinnamon buns . i don't know what flavor , but i don't like it . maybe they added almond or something . secondly , it way too sticky . my hair kept getting stuck my lips . it reminds me vaseline . since i got this product kit , i cannot return it , but i not using it again	-1

ick . i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would similar discontinued grapey color i used love loreal . smell - fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out . feel - i like lip gloss feels glossy . this stuff not shine enough or last long enough . color - color mild me . i very disappointed . i felt like i wasted money time . i still recommend loreal lip juice , though . i believe it same company , lip juice glossy , shiny , long-lasting way more cost-effective	-1
i used this product few times , trying justify money i spent . i could leave it my hair all day , effect essentially zilch . hair dead . it doesn't matter what propaganda beauty/cosmetics companies use promote their products , there no way vitamins , minerals , etc . going " feed " or strengthen your hair . when products washed out , so moisture . it dumb idea my part think putting guacamole my hair going make it a)smell good b)feel good . it really dumb me pay so much this stuff when i could've just easily much more cheaply made it myself	-1
its good waking up , because once you put it you feel refreshed because your lips feel fire . i like sting shine it . it finishes pretty fast roll ball may feel like little drag keep rolling lips , but i think it worth trying it unless you extreme sensitive lips , this stuff strong . i mention great smell ? yum ! me my boyfriend loved it .	1
its effect very much depends climate you live . if you live colder dry climate , especially during winter it exactly it promises - great moisturizer , lines diminished , puffiness . i really love using it - i am 35 currently living cold dry climate . but hot sometims humid climates , or during summer it just doesn't work well - i don't know why . i like it lot this my 3rd bottle , although i am using it seasonal eye care	1
if you like me get occasional zit when you least expect it , then this works out well . it not remove zit , but it cover nasty monster pretty well !! i put it under my lancome powder it really made difference . because it clear it blend whatever foundation or powder you use . oh yes it covers all redness comes those nasty zits . girls new best friend :	1
this currently my absolute favorite scent . i get so discouraged when smell somthing store love it , buy it , take it home put it , smells completely different me . i never problem this scent . it smells delicious bottle skin , if you like citrus . it smells like fresh , ripe orange , slightest hint spice . man my life finds it quite cuddle worthy . if you not familiar perfume oils , just somthing note . they highly concentrated , little goes long way . it also phases nicely , intense pleasently subtle long lasting . bonus there only few ingredients , so it less likely irritate sensitive skin . one bottle last last , there flexable applicator wand inside lid . i really can't say enough this wonderful fragrance	1
when i first tried this perfume , it reminded very much victoria secret pink -- it same distinctly sweet , strongly scented unique floral note , yet here bouquet significantly softer , sweeter . it would work well someone who likes sweet , girly scent light yet still pronounced . one drawback staying power poor : i couldn't detect any trait this just few hours later . this bit disappointing give high price , yet this still might good choice someone who looking everyday fragrance doesn't mind reapply	1
i : long , thick , fine hair naturally wavy . i don't color my hair but i get frizzies split ends , some dryness . i tried this product out after receiving small sample [ ... ] order , fell love it . i -love- smell , surprised other people didn't seem . i vastly prefer it some faker , more chemical smells lot shampoos seem use . i didn't use it leave , but deep conditioning treatment , afterwards i kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder , both smell it just feel how amazingly soft it . this product left my hair looking healthy , shiny , gorgeous days . i get fair number compliments my hair general , but after i used this stuff i getting stopped street . everyone lady starbucks my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked . i highly recommend it . i tried lot hair products , including some ( like fekkai glossing cream ) made olive oil , better results ojon ( though i like lot fekkai products ) . other products i recommend : healthy sexy hair shampoo , conditioner , leave-in conditioner , jonathan product anti-frizz serum , origins happy ending conditioner , fekkai products curly straight hair , depending your mood :) products i don't recommend include suave fekkai glossing shampoo ( left my hair shiny all right , but frizzy . ) i would suggest ordering it sephora , they carry several sizes , give samples all online orders , very , very good taking returns , even if you've tried product out just don't like it	1
i like this scent . my first thought pears , before reading what notes , yes , apples . this not hardcore apple scent , but enough so . very fresh sweet but not too sweet . crisp spring-like . hint , tiny hint dandelions tiny bit rose , just tiny bit . my husband likes this scent me well , which saying lot . he hates roses foody scents , but still likes this .	1
i really like this product . i would not , however , agree person who said it entirely too strong scent . i would actually like it stronger , less peel more juice smell . but it nice scent , cleans very thoroughly . not best i've used , but very nice	1
this soap smells great ! smells just like cherry lollipop ! continues smell even after shower throughout day . mix i love juicy shampoo , american cream conditioner candy dusting powder	1
excellent pair shears . sharp durable . i expect them last long time	1
i thick , coarse , african-american hair relaxed ( permed straight ) . i usually use this product wet hair ( after shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight . it makes it really smooth shiny . i received lot compliments my hair since i started using it . warm temperatures it melt down but my opinion it makes it easier use . when it solid you supposed rub it palm your hands liquify it then put it your hair . it smokey scent it but no one pays attention ... they looking how great my hair . i love ojon conditioner ( it very best i ever used)but shampoo my opinion seems dry my hair .	1
very good product great kind fruity smell . leave hair soft full " bounce " . easy comb hair after using this product but might combine kerastase conditionner very dry damage hair if your hair very long . price here still more expensive than europe : around 22 euros	1
i absolutely love clinique eye shadow . all their eye shadows go so smooth , never crease , just perfect shades colors my skin tone . almost peach color great because i use it highlighter under my brow or just base , either way i use it just every day ! :	1
okay so i love love love this kit . it includes everything you need awesome brows except aestician .. lol . i look forward see what else this young lady presents us	1

smells great ! not too harsh my thin but long hair	1
i'm not makeup or product junkie any means , but simply can't miss even one day using my all lips . it cream ( much like moisturizer ) exfoliates smoothes your lips makes them fuller/plumper . it also fills any lines you may around mouth so i recommend using it not only your lips but also outside lipline . although i using it twice daily many years , i believe someone using it first time should see results fairly quickly . friends mine who wear lipstick ( i don't ) also claim if they use it right before they put lipstick it makes it go better last longer . ( apparently you also use this product eye cream smooth crowsfeet around eyes , but i havent tried this- i prefer caudelie eye serum cream . ) simply put , i highly recommend this product know you'll see results i !	1
it lovely light refreshing perfume . lovely daywear . loves it guys	1
this one my favorite perfumes . i love anything vanilla this great combination it violets , musk iris . it strong smell , so go easy it . one spray lasts all day .	1
i received tube philosophy cinnamon buns flavored lip gloss christmas ( other philosophy products ) . i super excited try this because i've told numerous people philosophy products spectacular . first , i must point out there sparkles this lip gloss . although they're very subtle your lips , if you're type gal who hates sparkles shimmer your makeup , i'd stay away this product . smell , it smell like cinnamon buns . it certainly not taste like it however ( which good thing ... i tend lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good ... this lip gloss not taste good ) . it very sticky thick so you don't use too much . it also stays your lips good amount time . would i suggest this product ? if you're looking good-smelling , long lasting lip gloss , i'd definitely recommend this . however , if these two things don't matter you i'd suggest you skip this ($10 tube lip gloss isn't cheap after all ) go drugstore brand lip gloss	1
i never found compact foundation , cream or powder , looked lasted even remotely well liquid foundation dusting powder over it . until now . this amazing makeup , best part it doesn't take whole lot product achieve perfect coverage . my skin tends red , but this doesn't even hint it . plus , it nice matte without too dry . everyday , this my time saving , face perfecting miracle .	1
i using this cream almost 2 months now results amazing . my sun spots lightened it also decreased redness my face . i continue use it highly recommend it .	1
emotionally healing benefits orange oil lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this your scalp . if you find someone give you head massage this product , then you truly relax . if applying this yourself , it works well home hair treatment nourish hair follicles promote healthy hair growth . you also notice your hair becoming stronger retaining much deeper shine . essential oils this product help activate micro-circulation which may cause slight tingling warming scalp . leave this 5-10 minutes then wash your hair normal . you may find you need less conditioner when using this product . many hairdressers use this product when giving conditioning head massage where i first found out this product . i bought my first bottle day i massage . i impressed i keep buying this product . ~ rebecca review	1
this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise bright , shiny hair me . i nice hair begin ( if i say so myself ) , but i used this conjunction one lush conditioners(american cream)and my friends told me i shampoo model hair day . i'm not crazy beer-ish smell , which why i'll give it four rating . however , it doesn't seem very strong once you wash it out benefit worth it	1
i don't know why nobody else likes this product , but so far it only one works my ingrown facial hairs .. yes , it stings bit when i put it , but it quickly goes away . it doesn't dry my skin out , it actually helps get rid dry , white-looking flaky skin after i shave . i used get ingrown hairs so bad my face they would there months . eventually i'd get point my own surgery needle try extract hair . if i get ingrown hair now , i just use tend skin once morning once before bed , it actually extracts hair it own ! it gets rid redness swelling also associated ingrown hairs . only time my life my face actually looks clear , tend skin product it me . before i finish , i'd just like add i'm kind person nothing ever works . any product i try , never advertised . whether it shampoo , deodorant , medication , etc . tend skin one rarities actually work me . believe me , i've tried lot products ingrown hairs	1

avobath bath bomb turns water lovely luminous pale green . avocado , olive oil , lemongrass , bergamot , rosewood oil , gardenia extract makes this skin calming , soothing , moisturizing dream . " green luster " makes this bath especially beautiful gives it mermaid mood . i loved this one so much , i'm ordering two next time . scent lemon/lime , but time you get tub , floral scents more prominent . you add some bubbles , but they don't seem last very long - well , i using bath gel . so , you may want find bubble bar because olive oil seems make them disappear pretty fast . least , my theory because i've noticed bath oil same thing . avobath goes well whoosh products or happy hippy shower gel . if you mood , you might want amazing " godiva " shampoo conditioner 2 1 bar ( magical quality - makes hair super shiny ) or " i love juicy " shampoo " veganese " conditioner . last two also citrus scent especially delicious . when i use lush products , i'm good mood all week long . it truly amazing how happy content i am long i some lush products around . :) ~ rebecca review	1

oh my gosh ! i love this lip gloss so much . i first bought one last year , it best item makeup i've ever bought ! it goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone . all colors great , but i'd start our pink first . my personal favorite " spring fling " because it not so bright , but it still juicy . you deffinetly not regret buying one these . it worth every penny	1
i using this product years . i really oily t-zone , i find this product keeps it control . it very good cleanser removes oil without drying your skin . no matter what color your skin tone may , i think you like this product !	1
tounge-and grove way handle detached make it easy use shower ( dont my glasses ) . detachable brush medium soft bristles easy skin . strap brush cotton , so this probably isn't once-in-a lifetime purchase , but very good price . everybody needs one	1
i long , thick , wavy hair loves frizz up . i tried every anti-frizz , hairstyling product out there , they either didn't work or weighed my hair down . i didn't want like this hair dryer hoping it wouldn't live up hype ... but , it excellent my hair . after using dryer ( no styling product ) my hair straight , shiny felt great . me , it didn't change amount time i dried my hair , so if your considering buying it speed , don't , unless you thin or short hair . it worth $200.00 price tag ? depends you personally , but i recommend you shop around because there better deals out there	1
i tried just every hair product market this very much surpassed my expectations ! i wasn't sure when i put it my hair , but i styling it , i amazed . it created lot volume my hair stayed shiny . i am ready try rest product line	1
this one philosophy 3-in-1 products . it used shampoo , bubble bath , shower gel . i've only used it shower gel , so that all i'm able review here . shower gel , this product exceptional . it extremely rich thick gel , produces generous lather abundant bubbles . i find it somewhat moisturizing- it doesn't explicitly moisturize my skin , but it also doesn't dry it out , even winter . addition , gel opaque creamy , rather than clear , like most shower gel . melon daquiri scent summery fruity . it pleasant sweet melons scent . it doesn't smell especially alcoholic ; though it part philosophy line 3-in-1s meant smell like fruity cocktails- like margaritas pina coladas . scent more fruity melon than alcoholic melon . said , people who like juicy , fruity scents likely love this . while i haven't tried using this bubble bath or shampoo , rich lather i get shower gel suggests me it would probably work very well other two parts 3-in-1 . one thing may problematic people- scent doesn't last beyond shower . i can't smell it my skin anymore when i get out shower , though scent quite strong while use . some people may find problematic . i like it doesn't clash my perfume , so it okay me .	1
i admit i tried find cheaper sunscreen same things this one without irritating my skin , but i keep ending back this one . it awesome . it feels great your skin , works great , so lightweight . it so easy wear under makeup if necessary , it leaves flattering look skin . when it first showed up i thought it awfully small amount , but then i realized it only takes tiny , tiny amount cover your whole face because it water-light . so it lasts ( least me ) least month daily use . my opinion only thing they could improve this product would make it sweat/water-proof , but then it might not feel good skin it . i can't find better facial sunscreen money	1
i love pine . i want eat it . i am nature detective so i love out doors so this woodsy perfum great me	1
... what you've doing or last night . this stuff feels nice cool leaves this great shimmering highlight which looks absolute natural best out few other types i've tried . really nice stuff !!	1

i've using this product , mild facial soap dramatically different moisturizer , fourteen years now . i remember my consultation clinique rep like it yesterday . therein lies rub -- if you've never used these products considering doing so , it best visit clinique representative help you decide which products best your skin . lot times , people not know what skin type they or think they one when it really . if you're not using right ones your skin type , you won't get results you need . clinique reps help . talk them first then you purchase anywhere ! i myself combination skin . clinique rep warned me i might some initial blemishes , i , but they tapered off after week or so . just out shower , or after long day who knows what may gotten your skin , this uplifting , cooling-when-it's-hot , breath fresh zinginess . often one all over swipe this cotton ball not enough -- so use other side puff , dab more clarifying lotion apply again , maybe more cotton ball till it no longer turns any shade . this worth it . you taking off not only makeup facial soap may not caught , but any impurities daily activity attract skin -- dirty fingers unconciously rubbed over neck or cheek , etc . follow up clinique moisturizer that right you your skin feel five times lighter . your skin important . these products helped mine stay amazing shape over years	1
i've mild case eczema , so am also always keeping eye out products help my skin , without resorting cortizone creams ... i've some success past using straight jojoba coconut oil eczema patches - but not enough keep up hassle oily spots skin . i even tried making my own recipes - some success . but , it time consuming i just don't time mess around kitchen cosmetics hobby . after looking reviews various types lotions/creams lush line , i decided give this one go . i've only using it couple days , but already my skin less irritated , scaliness seems diminishing some . ( eczema strikes top my feet bit ankle ... makes wearing combat boots bit annoying when its acting up)i'll probably need week or two steady use really know if it works i'm hoping , but so far so good ... there no real strong scent lotion - so it shouldn't bother those who sensitive smells . so also pretty cool end well :-) works great rest my skin well !! no more dryness winter weather anymore	1
used night cream or moisturizer under makeup .	1
white linen lovely , soft , exquisitely feminine fragrance . it floral notes tone down true soft lingering beauty . this one my favorite lauder fragrances one i really recommend . 5 stars estee !!	1
this product really what it says - it lifts smooths , conceals too . it best concealer i've tried , i've tried many . one note though - lightest shade very light . i very fair skin found it too white , so i exchanged it 2nd shade , which would also work well fair medium skin . great product	1
i like clean fresh scent . it not too heavy not overpowering . it comes cute pink bottle	1
i looking new scent stumbled upon this . i sold instantly never gotten so many comments any perfume i ever worn before . well worth it !!	1
i've always really dry , chapped lips always putting lip balm under my lipstick , before bed , probably million times throughout day . but nothing seemed help ... lipstick always seemed dry them out even more nothing looks worse than dry lips lipstick . it just makes your lips look even drier . buzz latte lip balm most amazing product ever !!! it smells like coffee really strong first but then goes away . it doesnt taste bad either . yes , its $8 bucks tube ... but tube twice size normal chapsticks so cost evens out . this product lasts forever ... why ? because it stays so long ... even lipstick or lip glosses . first time i put this when i tried friends . within hours i noticed dramatic difference so i went out bought my own . my lips never so smooth full . bare escentuals continues suprise me all their products !!! i dont think i every try makeup line . i think what makes this product work so well its got lot shea butter it . but this product amazing ! you even dip it bare escentuals blushes or eyeshadows create matching lipstick . this absolute must any makeup collection or anyone who suffers dry , chapped lips . you wont sorry .... you'll notice difference right away	1
years , i paying more imported french mattifier devastated when company stopped selling here . i tried other popular mattifiers ( namely smashbox photo finish ) , but this far best . turns out it good thing i forced find product . this product makes my shine huge pores my cheeks just vanish . i'm matte longer during day , since blush sticks this product well , i don't need foundation . i'd recommend it anyone wants their skin surface look smoother less shiny . i'm not huge fan clinique general , but this one product keeps me coming back	1
i love this shower gel , coming me , high praise , since i not love shower , am especially crabby when this activity must morning . you see , i much prefer languish warm bath , letting bubbles work getting clean me , instead devoting my energy good book . yet when i'm standing shower , enveloped clouds delicious blackberry steam , i am miraculously transformed crabby morning shower girl into very happy girl who then goes her merry way walks up friends work offering arm encouraging them " smell me " . lovely !!	1
i've used this product year couldn't happier . i am not ' makeup person ' this product just what i need smooth out my complexion moisturize my oily skin . fine lines large pores appear less noticable , skin remains shine-free , skin tone appears more even skin feels softer . one recommendation ..... directions tell you wait 2 minutes allow product ' set ' . get best finish , especially if applying powder ( like i ) or foundation over primer , you need wait full 2 minutes . this can't stressed enough .	1
product tip-top shape , itself wonderful fragrance , but i ordered hopes getting it here certain date it not arrive time i hoped . gift-wrap very lackluster could much better . good product , bad delivery	1
i love baby grace !! it so pretty mellow girly . i usually spray am i keep this solid my purse refresh during day . it long lasting doesn't stain clothing or make you sticky	1
lush famous scent , this one unforgettable . check ingredients this one -- great soft water shampooing	1
i love taste this , it so yummy . tastes like lemon cookies cake . looks good too . i would give it 5 stars except only downer philosophy glosses they pretty sticky , so if you animals , you get fur stuck your lips sometimes , or whatever . you know what i mean , sticky gloss attracts things . but it looks good tastes very good	1
always , this delivered very timely manner i completely satisfied	1

this cutest packaged eyeshadow market . brush sits down shadow perfect amount powder gets it . if you don't get much shadow tip , just shake bottle little brush fills up more more dramatic effect . unlike other loose eyeshadow powders you use your own brush , this doesn't get too much brush or your eyelid it easy layer . it fantastic shimmer it each color looks good my skin color ( which really rare most cosmetics ) i can't tell you how much i love this stuff ! so go ahead buy it , don't forget shake bottle cap brush each time you apply so powder re-dispursts bottle . :	1
karma smells just like head shop me . you decide yourself if floats your boat or not . powder smells even more delicious than perfume . my only problem it texture . it slightly gritty . i wish they would fix . it may sound strange , but also , if you use powder white undies , it color them orange ..	1
this product good . only problem eyebrow tint looks kind weird part where you don't eyebrows . i only use it when i am putting lot makeup , otherwise it looks kind fake everyday use . coloring really good blondes	1
i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1
i've using this product years . every now then i try product hopes finding something little cheaper . i never found anything comes close this one . i'm over forty , but still somewhat oily skin , get breakouts occasion . if i use this two three times per week , i definitely notice i fewer breakouts . my skin smoother more even . i like menthol feel . i don't smell it all , find it refreshing . i've also tried 7-day scrub don't find it come close this product . grains 7-day scrub few far . exfoiliating scrub , they very concentrated . too much ? just add little water . i only hope clinique doesn't stop making this	1
i stumbled upon this shower gel collection this past christmas season . i knew right away this would perfect solution lot holiday gifts my list . i pleased i could knock off number ladies off my list one purchase . i even happier free shipping $30 amazon gift card offer they going time . i couldn't wait package arrive . i ripped into it soon it got me . gels all packed nicely sturdy box handle philosophy . i restrain myself keeping all gels . i managed give away nine them after some agonizing deliberation . ( mint chocolate chip , lemon custard , berry ones mine . ) plus cool box made perfect container all my other gels i rotate according season . i'm big fan most philosophy products . they some awesome smelling shower gels well wonderfully working skincare products . i already familar excellent cinnamon buns double cocoa scents so i figured most these should pretty darn good too . mint chocolate chip nice but lemon custard weaker smelling out bottle . all their 3-in-1s , oh well , some hit where others miss . all their 3-in-1s , shower gel makes mounds lather , cleans your skin usually without drying , works fairly well shampoo too - though conditioner typically needed . i like shower gels lot . i know my gal pals enjoyed their christmas gift too . all things considered , this fantastic deal !	1
scent cynthia sylvia stout shampoo fabulous , sticks you , shampoo also great . price steep , yes , but worth it . don't bother 3.3 oz " trial size " because you'll most likely only waste shipping charges go order bigger bottles next time	1

i using these since sometime early 1990s . before web made them easier find , we used ask family friends visiting hawaii pick them up us . i've recommended them many others over years because they easier than back brush , more vigorous than wash cloth , quick-drying . salux brand rougher ( i think better ) than imitations i since seen	1
i don't know how many mascaras i own but there always two or three i hold my favorite or just different occasions . one those hypnose i really like it when i go out or just looking dramatic look . postive : 1 . ) look : i've never neccessarily wanted wear fake eyelashes but they look almost perfect . unbelievably , hypnose gives you look . it amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look . 2 . ) flaking : this mascara never really flaked bottom my eyes . that really important me . negative : 1 . ) this mascara starts out great but after two half weeks it starts emptying out you . this might just because there days when i reapplyed it or simply because i just used it pretty well ( 1 coat just everyday because how much i liked it ) . summary : if you want natural yet " those real lashes ?! " look , then you'll like this mascara . i'm giving it four stars instead five simply because how long it lasts but if you use it once it while , then it last you while	1
my background : i used gillette sensor . it okay . i upgraded sensor xl . it pretty good . i tried mach 3 , i hated it -- it felt like i wiping my face wall blades . i finally settled sensor 3 -- nearly 2 bucks blade . it got job , but there no real joy shaving . considering i it least once day ( twice if i'm going out night ) process should more enjoyable . after quite bit research , including newsgroups customer reviews , i splurged got merkur futur ( though i got chrome finish ) . shaving awesome , i literally look forward it . lathering up shave cream ( i use crabtree evelyn sandlewood ) this brush real treat . super soft , holds ton water , results thick lather . ( warned , first few times you use it , it stinks like wet badger ... but it goes away ) . razor itself heavy ... i mean heavy . which good , because you need let razor work -- no pressure , or you take off you face ) . main difference this razor shaving cartridges , you actually feel blade against your face ( opposed chunk plastic ) . anyone who shave barber knows how great this feels . once i got technique down it close smooth shave i ever . finishing up cold water splash , non-alcoholic toner / aftershave , moisturizing lotion , invigorating way start day . please note : stated above brush smells little " badgery " first , but it goes away . head razor not pivot , so you follow contours your face . head itself it bulky , so you work your technique around your nose , under you chin . sum , this razor adds old-school , refreshing routine my mornings . i love it , would whole-heartedly recommend it .	1
i fine hair , little dry but not too bad . always controlled it gel . try conditioner - it thickened settled my hair one use . i'm hooked	1
i merkur razor i bought one year ago . i dropped it locker room gym it chipped . so i kept it spare , but new one ( merkur heavy duty safety razor ) best ! i should bought this one begin . it makes shaving pleasure ! i enjoy shaving everyday ! it helps start my day , looking my best !!	1
