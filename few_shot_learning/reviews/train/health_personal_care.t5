pedometer arrive held prisoner difficul t-t o-o pen plastic cell -- what these " packaging engineers " thinking ? it took me ten minutes two ruined fingernails open it , then i took scissors it , hard packaging almost broke them ! but i thrilled . handsome object , thought i , i loved clip back you pinch open . so much better than wrestle it down over soft waistband . i yanked out plastic battery protector set work rev thing up speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions they written .

first shave seemed good ; but second time me fusion . instead just one nick , i managed around 3 or 4 nicks once . but looking cost replacement cartridges put me into state price shock . i got merkur heavy duty double edge safety razor blades huge savings . merkur blades or feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece . feather blades extremely sharp ! gillette sensor more practical me when big hurry . good old fashioned shave using double edge safety razor , badger hair shaving brush , some proraso shave cream tube alot more enjoyable relaxing me !	-1
like many other negative reviews , i've experienced same problems this razor . i guess less blades more i'm going back m3 power . i'll brief problems : 1 . there more " pulling " when you shave . it felt like hair my face pulled out than cut . 2 . razor harder clean off . 3 . i would get slight razor burn i never get razor burn . 4 . it more expensive than other better razors out there.so there you it . if you try it out , hey it might work you . but please , keep your receipt ( packaging ) case you want get refund . ** if you're reading this 2009 , chances gillette money back guarantee no longer around . however , there probably gillette razor 12 blades then	-1

i bought this cushion because i move california new york expected drive torture my back . i researched these types cushions decided get this one because it lot motors compared cheaper units , because i recently bought mogu pillow really liked soft feel i t--t his cushion " sqush , " which similar feel . cushion middle portion sqush which concentrated into 3 " lumps " -- your shoulders , lower back , under front part your thighs , near your knees . lumps soft squishy covered spandex-like material . rest cushion feels like fleece . when i first plugged it , i immediately disappointed weakness wimpy motors . even highest intensity ( i never even bother lower two ) , it felt like nothing more moderate vibration -- definitely not enough un-knot aching back . pre-set programs fine but i rarely use them . it comes straps but i hard time trying install it my car because instructions non-existent it wasn't intuitive all . i ended up just attaching them some hardware underside chair , which worked well . i can't decide if cushion made drive any more bearable . lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but shoulder padding must too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward forced me into slight hunched position which strained my back made it hurt . thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult slide into seat because it effectively raises level seat ( my car doesn't fancy seat controls ) i wedge myself into seat . massaging feature helpful because it fun thing boring drive it helped little keep circulation going , but it simply wasn't powerful enough really effective . worse thing thigh motor died only few hours into my trip !! it 2 year warranty , but you pay $5 " handling " fee ! i'm mad myself throwing away box because if i hadn't , i'd return it amazon wash my hands it . overall , this cushion underpowered , unreliable , not orthopedically correct it should . it definitely not worth outrageous price . i regret not buying simple lumbar cushion instead . i wish i saved my money homedic highly rated shiatsu seat cushion instead , although i'm somewhat leary their product reliability now	-1

i've using this shaver almost year , am disappointed it . years , i've used older style remingtons shaped like rectangular prism . i suppose this new shape intended fit hand better , but i never got used it . i find myself supporting shaver my other hand because i feel like i'll drop it otherwise . big problem screen . try very hard avoid letting your skin come contact edge screen . otherwise , blades bite you sometimes draw blood . clean , it easy enough remove screen assembly , but getting it back tricky . if not very careful , it goes unevenly gets stuck . practice , it usually works first time . funniest thing this shaver plug plugs into wall . it looks like cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug 1920s	-1
these glasses bit disappointment . convenience out weighed uncomfortable fit - they really snug no possibility adjustment . actually they annoying how they hung when not use . great idea but maybe some " fine tuning " would help ... like more flexible strap rather than plastic frame just super long go around your neck .	-1
this unit all marketing features , date , time , memory stores up 48 prior readings date time , but there one problem its not acurate . my doctor said wrist cuffs -10% off just because taking reading wrist not arm next heart , just like taking your bp right arm . further you heart lower your readings . example : doctor takes my bp then i take it cuff monitor he/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min . we tried it several times each time it incorrect . so he told me not use it . i bought simular unit , no date , time screen , but stores 99 prior readings , tested again doctor nurse found it within limits . she said you never get same reading twice row . some nurses doctor even take three readings take average .	-1
i am african american woman long , chemically relaxed hair . full-time undergraduate student , i cannot afford visit salon weekly basis . i purchased this flat iron whim market because my previous flat iron recently shorted out ( it older model no swivel cord ) . i chose this flat iron because it same brand my last one , i overwhelmingly satisfied its performance . i cannot say same this product . retrospect , it exactly what it claims , but nothing beyond . my previous flat iron , i could straighten style my layered hair same time , which significantly cut amount heat damage my hair endure . any attempts style my hair underwhelming say least . after using flat iron , my hair looked fizzy unkempt , even bit damaged . any curls i managed produce looked undefined limp . it chance i purchased curling iron addition flat iron , able successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight applying frizz control serum . needless say , you won't able produce " fresh salon " look this flat iron , which sadly exactly what i needed . i not feel confident my hair when stepping out house after using this product . if you don't use this tool anything but sleek , straight looks bottle frizz serum handy , then this great product you . while i am not happy its results , it now . i'll saving better iron while praying straightening curling my hair doesn't leave it severely damaged .	-1

it what it supposed , my bras came out wash without any weird creases . however , some bras hold up better washing machine than others , i think one i put into brababy one more durable ones . while it what it supposed , it definitely not easy use . i difficulty putting b-size cup without squishing bra . clasp also badly designed . if it breaks , it not big deal tie outer ball closed , but whole thing poorly engineered . i think it made even harder seeing how i tried using brababy front-closing racer back . end , i think it would easier just effective use lingerie bag . i don't recommend this product	-1

i use three razors . last year model this braun , triple blade rotary leading manufacturer rotary razors standard double edged disposables major manufacturer razors . ok , now , let some math . i get 10 great shaves disposable razor . i pay , average , 40c or so disposable razor . nickel shave including shave cream . nickel shave , it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $150 . would take me over 8 years . now , anyone says any electric razor shaves better than double edged high quality blade razor ( not even expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) dreaming . blace much better job much faster . but , sometimes , they irritate skin , but electrics too . i get irritated both , sooooo , i rotate them , find reduces my skin irritation problem quite well . i bought this braun ( last year model ) after reading positive reviews here , later bought rotary razor . basic difference cheap model rotary major manufacturer much quieter , shaves just well , cost me 1/3 price . only thing better braun battery lasts longer . it possible also , some cases , it gives slightly closer shave than rotary , but it also tends miss spots no matter how many times i go over them . braun also problem my beard when it longer , like when i two three days growth . rotary disposable razor breeze through three day bush . cleaning machine/charger comes braun joke . yes , it cleans razor great , but it way oversized you need large space it your bathroom . even then , say you larger space , you pay $5.00 $8.00 each cleaning cartridges . i found they last month before drying out . add $60 your annual cost just clean your razor . rotary cleans fine brush disposable razors water . finally , switch turns razor right where you hold razor it also locks blade . so i am constantly locking blade position accident . inexcusable design flaw razor this price . don't get me wrong . this razor shaves fine . it works best short beards works better than cheap razors . but $50 you get better rotary razor $150 you shave over 8 years disposable twin blade . price difference sound rational you ? if it , click " proceed order "	-1

ok i picked up corded vidal sassoon hairclipper target . thing so absolutely horrible i come amazon vent it . blades seemed blunt , if not nonexistent . it would only cut little tufts hair , hair taut , literally held my fingers . it literally tried rip hair out my head . my follicles still hurt hour or so i spent trying shave my head this terrible clipper . most hair i actually successfully removed , due scissors . lubrication blade adjustment screwdriver no effec t--t he blades weren't * stuck * , they just * suck . * i don't care how much money vidal sassoon spends trying portray themselves trendy cutting edge fashion maintenance -- judging this horrible experience , they really , really not know how make decent hairclipper . i shaved my head plenty times over last few decades , i seen some bad clippers , but never i experienced clipper so bad it would probably bested haircut given sharpened stone instead .	-1
this item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks i bit hole right side it came apart i only wear it 4-6 hours night . this product very poor because it expensive if you replace them every 6 weeks or so . i like design it doesn't cut up my mouth but i can't replacing it every other month	-1

i bought two clarisonic brushes - one gift one myself . although product works well , unfortunately , both brushes defective . trouble started occurring two months after using . one brush started out two speed settings , but eventually only functioned low setting . other brush started turning itself eventually could not recharged ! my experience customer service terrible . they would not replace my brush me even though product still under warranty . careful if you going travel abroad . warranty brush nulled if you use brush power outlet other than 110v !	-1
this remington razor actually too sharp if you ask me . i used it period several weeks it caused my face blister it actually gave me more cuts than 10 cent disposable razor . ouch . however , shave very close - expect use lot cooling lotion this razor . design shaver mechanically fine appears fairly reliable - although its touch hard clean because blades super sharp underneath foils . i owned norelco braun more than 15 years whole found them more agreeable shave	-1
scale everything manufacturer claims . however , minimal use one average sized adult , our scale lasted only nine months . balance part scale very sound , but battery clip powers electronics poorly designed built very cheap components . i suspect poor qa result fairly high percentage these units failing recommend you go elsewhere . today , my scale not function unless i hold batteries hand ( not too practical when someone standing it ... ) . conclusions : * scale design nice -- looks good . * construction balance components solid , glass very strong . design construction power unit ( battery ) rather poor . * scale functions advertised normal sized ( 80kg/175lb ) adult ... until battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale favor something more solid battery compartment connections . hope this helps !	-1

i first bought standard , then large size attempt pair fit well . i used them riding bike winter months . neither pair fit well there most likely very few people who obtain good fit . goggles snug enough prevent wind entering ( prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above ear . rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses motorcyclists .	-1
i purchased this humidifier , it worked wonderfully soothing blue night light my son week . one night , it just stopped producing humidifying mist could not coaxed into working again . i called company , who told me promptly cut cord throw it out , they would sending new one replace it ( no cost shipping me ) . i received new one week later , which my disappointment , not nightlight feature . i also noticed it different brand company . i can't remember name but it also began word " sun .

i overwhelmed choices , selected this model , part , because reasonal price . i read reviews which mentioned problems need return product , but i decided there only small possibility happening . instructions said use lowest setting initially , which certainly made sense . however , instructions said move adjustment " toward tip " , which turned out highest , not lowest setting ! diagram handle indicated movement toward larger opening , but i read directions not look diagram until later . spray very powerful actually " hurt " , especially when it my tooth crown . next day i tried adjusting settings pik over my sink , not my mouth ! it felt wonderful lower setting ! i reread directions again ( again over next several days ) see if error mine or theirs . i still think directions not written properly . third day i trouble getting any spray all . this continued week , some days getting more or less , but never full spray any setting ! my guess it permanent " pause " mode . i gave up pursued returning item . it needed returned " authorized repair " , which luckily only few miles away ( there only three my state ) . repair man told me , over phone , it discontinued model hadn't made year . when he looked it , he found it made 2006 . he said he could fix it , but wasn't allowed ; i am awaiting replacement arrive mail .	-1

i recently purchased obus forme lowback backrest , seat cushion . although i heard people rave excellent support , they felt comfortable enough me , i can't give them more than 2 stars . material used their construction drove me distraction . this obviously personal preference type thing . other folks may no issues material all . these just my feelings matter : i found texture fabric little rough it didn't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just few hours work . also , when making any movements , compression foam , friction it fabric covering , made really annoying noises . it reminded me somewhat snow compressing down when walking it . backrest even worse than seat cushion because it thin plastic wrapping ( looked sort like shrink wrap or saran wrap ) around foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time i even twitched . it awful ! however good science behind backrest cushion , sound effects unpleasant texture distracting enough , me least , return both items .	-1

these hair topia pills nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used buy them . i first bought these pills last year june 2005 after hair formula 37 unsuccessful promise producing longer stronger hair four months usage . well , these pills not expensive previous brand mentioned , promised also change dry brittle hair long healthy , it absolute nothing . i said myself , like hair formula 37 , maybe i just need give this more time , so i bought 2-month supply gave it 3 months all there no difference all . this product might just work others , which it , but it certainly didn't work me . i must admit i brought this myself , my mother warned me not buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they nothing hair grows naturally anyway , if you really want get hair pills then just buy them whole lot cheaper regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills too damn expensive , so when you paying all money then you expect it work . fact it not infuriating because $39.99 + $7 shipping , total little over $46 , lot money spend something nothing . thus , i am here warn others not waste their precious money . if you going , please don't it this site-you buy this product little cheaper hairboutique.com .	-1

before you buy , sure check where pen made . i number older cross pens say " usa " near top , they great pens . however , i bought three different ones past few years not indicate where they made , they inferior quality . top bottom halves loose , carefully manipulated come together without gap . first one i got , i sent it back cross warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only receive it back unchanged telling me it just fine - " handling fee " attached . i willing believe it simply anomaly , one bad pen . so later when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only see they same quality defect . my advice : if you want good cross pen , go secondhand store buy one made usa . they aren't making them same anymore .	-1

i surprised find positive reviews this heating pad , since i just returned mine after one use . perhaps one i got defective , but even highest setting this heating pad barely warm touch wasn't hot enough penetrate my sore back muscle . i also thought convenience strapping pad would excellent target lower back area , found shape pad flimsy elastic strap provided very uncomfortable wear . placement strap doesn't allow pad conform body , but only press against it where strap runs through - just center , not rest pad . i realize there probably now safety standards heating pads preclude them getting too warm , but hopefully they not so stringent not allow any electric heating device getting warm enough penetrate sore muscles properly . time i'll keep wearing thermacare(tm ) back wraps ( which expensive - could bought two heating pads now ) but last 8 hours time provide intense enough heat . also , this disposable product surprisingly comfortable wear more directly applies heat area where i need it . if you need intense heat sore back , i'd skip this heating pad	-1

i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer over year ago because it retractable cord folding capabilities . even price attractive . it really take up little room my bathroom drawer retractable cord plus . i thought i perfect blow dryer because it what it supposed quickly . now bad news : retractable cord became chewed up frayed after daily use it became apparent cord ultimately going fray completely due time . then , folding handle , low behold , broke half one morning . ( course , warranty long expired ) . this dryer too fragile consider using daily basis i consider myself careful person when it comes handling small appliances such hair dryers . when i've replaced hair dryers past , it because they've simply reached end their lifespans burned out . i'd caution anyone consider this before buying because these 2 features alone , while very appealing , shorten otherwise good hairdryer lifespan . i've now purchased t3 tourmaline ( featherweight , quiet hairdryer no retractable cord or folding handle ) which seems work just fine appears much longer lifespan .	-1

i bought this item my wife exactly four months ago ( 9-15-06 ) she said it working well most four months . she concerns because electrical cord which attachs unit rotates when it rotated certain angles , heat would turn off ( indicated green light which either off , flickers or solid ) . she used it , problem became more more frequent . now , unit not work unless it one point certain angle ( which i guess allows electricity go unit ) . i tried taping it location but cord also stay certain angle which impossible maintain when using iron . this not very good such expensive item which gets alot twisting turning use should highest materials workmanship prevent electrical . my wife admits like anyone unit dropped , but should not cause electrical cord problem . dropping iron risks breaking two flat iron ceramic plates , which still perfectly intact . problem because cord , way flat iron used , there alot cord twisting . what advertised " professional " device cost which only professional would normally purchase , we cannot believe this could used " professional " environment . my wife only uses it six or seven times week , not six or seven times day like salon . we highly recommend you stay away this product .	-1

this isn't what i thought it would . instructions unclear , so i refer box guess how install it . i finally figured it out after 10 minutes fiddling it . you push down top get more than tiny bit gel out - so it takes two hands . means once you put gel your face , you get gel machine . i set mine machine hottest setting it feel warm . this must safety thing , but i can't imagine what lower settings . gel cools extremely fast , so time you apply it your face , only gel where you first apply it feels warm . i same machine foam worked lot better , but i don't use foam shaving creme anymore . once i use up this gel , hot gel machine gets retired .	-1

definitely best heating pad i've ever experienced . i'll never buy any other kind heating pad again . this far best well worth money . i love it set temperature precisely much higher than any other heating pads i've ever seen ( only " high medium low " settings , usually high medium settings cause burns , or don't get hot enough , or go barely any heat burning ! ) this heating pad lcd shows actual temperature it , which great . yes it feels very moist , but not like you're getting dampness your clothing . my only complaint it shuts off after 60 minutes . i could easily this all day :	1

my bedroom receives inordinate amount morning light , light sleeper , i've tried numerous ways protect my slumber . it doesn't help my husband ( god love him ) snores loud small jet plane . i've tried silicone ear plugs satin eye masks only find plugs make me feel like i head cold masks leave unwanted gaps let light . i received tranquility zone eye mask birthday present i could hardly wait try it . i love this thing ! it thick large enough block out all light , due design , mask positioned perfectly over my ears . sounds pleasant ( i'm big fan " babbling brook " track ) i love able plug my mp3 player so i listen my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i've given this 5 stars because there no option 4.5 . all honesty , there few drawbacks . first , when i say this thick i'm not kidding . without my a/c summer it might get bit warm . second , sound clips themselves very short loops ... so if you brain like mine tunes what you're hearing you'll notice clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . it not this i'd bigger fan first track -- one sounds like you're forest -- but i get distracted ( awakened ) hearing bird sound comes closer then fades . even these things mind , i say i haven't slept this well years . i love this thing , i wish i'd found it earlier . fact , i love it so much i've given it gift two friends who'd tried my mask while they visiting fell love it , too	1

i read these reviews before buying this , i probably wouldn't purchased it . but i looking much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked . i didn't ask if there certain model he recommended , so i assumed i'd pay $40-$150 sonicare . when i saw this one $30 target , i figured i didn't much lose . i've no problems any other problems mentioned happy how it makes my teeth feel super clean even cleaned this spot even my dental hygienist couldn't get . it turns off automatically after 2 minutes , so i know i'm brushing my teeth longer . one thing takes getting used not removing it while it going ... you'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself ! :d plus not your tummy jiggle like it manual toothbrush !! only negative it goes thru 2 aa batteries once month , but directions said it lasts 60 brushes per battery change that right . i've started using rechargable batteries no problems .	1

jerdon 7p7506cf ( or i call it , ol'6cf ) nice , reflective wall-attachable mirror . i can't say enough how reflective this thing ; i'm bit amateur facepainter ( although i zero artistic ability- my spider-man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes ) , so i need good mirror whenever i self-paint . i gone through three similar models before finding 6cf , none clear user-friendly . short , if you're looking best mirror value your dollar , i can't recommend this thing enough . it mirror 21st century , beyond	1

unlike many other reviewers , i actually bought this shaver use my head . i shaving my head past 2 years during time used panasonic es8066 . it fine product ( able used either wet or dry , unlike braun ) , but i no idea upgrading braun 8985 would make such difference . i shaved my head one third time it took me using panasonic ! no longer i need keep going over same spot again again . braun took off hair one or two passes , cutting just close considerable ease less irritation . i can't believe i wasted two years shaving my old shaver ! i know panasonic since come out new improved shavers , i can't comment its new vortex shaver , but i know i won't returning my new braun any time soon	1

over years various jobs , i seen this flashlight several times . it abused subjected most terrible chemical physical abuse . it may end up looking beat up yucky , but they always work , no matter what contractor or whomever it . if you need reliable flashlight toolbox , work truck , pick-up glove compartment , etc ., this only one you need . if you need good flashlight home , tired buying throwing out all those junky flashlights grocery store , this one last flashlight you ever buy . i finally bought one just my home , i am only sorry i not this years ago ( i am also happy one these things not totally beat up like one my toolbox ; i refuse replace it ) . i like this version because it strong magnet , you stick onto refrigerator or side your truck . i also like it switch guards , so it not accidentally turned because it buried beneath 25# stuff your toolbox . one nit-picky complaint . it clip spare bulb behind reflector . however , it comes empty you supply your own , so buy spare bulb same time you buy this flashlight .	1

i all set typical 10 day antibiotic course sinus infection ( i even bought antibiotics ) , but decided try this first . it very effective clearing sinuses , nose , throat lungs . couple things : 1 . it makes minor mention using solution ( if desired ) tank provided . i used vicks . it more than doubles steam output . so even if you don't get solution , use plain water . without it , output not impressive . 2 . if you get vicks , get your magnifying glass out read dilution instructions . they not make it clear without reading fine print it highly concentrated solution . if you add it undiluted , i think you'll go blind ... i highly recommend this unit	1

i really liked this product . i am late 30 woman whose skin basically pretty good . i occasional mild breakouts some blackheads , but even before i bought neutrogena microdermabrasion i would receive compliments how smooth my skin . but around age 35 i looked mirror realized my skin getting middle-age dullness it . unwilling pay professional microdermabrasion , i decided try neutrogena home system . neutrogena microdermabrasion cream easy apply . cream slightest pleasant smell , not sticky all . i used well less than teaspoon , so little goes long way . it no problem rinse it off my face water , sponge very easy clean well . treatment took me less than 10 minutes , fit easily my bedtime routine , after initial start-up treatments you only need it couple times week . my skin definitely felt softer , smoother more invigorated . i could notice difference after only one treatment . but real proof came way my husband double take couple days later commented i looked younger . ( he didn't know microdermabrasion . ) even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty . there clear noticeable difference -- after only few treatments my middle-aged dull skin definitely gotten back some its youthful glow , few large pores i appear smaller . lazy , i not incorporated it into my regular routine like i should , but i pull it out few days before special occasions , vacations , or anytime i feel need little brightening up , definitely always keep it hand . if you particularly sensitive skin , this may not great product you , it bit , well , abrasive . me , it painless process , i would highly recommend it anyone looking give their skin more youthful glow	1

i bought epilator because i tired shaving my legs waxing just too expensive me . i've my epilator several weeks now i am already seeing amazing results ! i used it first time my legs . i'm not going lie ... it painful . i just made sure go slowly , pausing every few inches , making sure my skin pulled tightly i could get it . eventually , i able get most thick , dark hairs off my legs . ** please know epilator not immediate " cure-all " . hair grows stages , so soon you get rid some hairs , several more grow behind them . ( eventually you probably get rid most all them , but it take some time . ) because this , it good try epilating couple times week . since it winter , i just let it all grow out so epilator get more hairs . however , when new hair grows , i am finding they thinner blonde instead dark brown . it doesn't hurt nearly much pull those out ! i also know i'll able this spring summer because hair lighter . my legs smoother i don't get razor burn ! right after epilating , sometimes i experience little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just short time . neat thing , unlike waxing , epilator grab teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . this gives your skin smoother feel it gets hairs beginning stages growth ! i used wait two weeks or so my hair grow long enough waxed . now , i get smoother skin just whenever i want ! i little nervous first spending money product i not heard much . exception few reviews i read online , i pretty much dark . i went ahead went it , then realized this thing paid itself two weeks ! not only i epilated my legs , i also used it under my arms , my upper lip , my bikini line . results better than i could imagined !! again , i'm not going lie ... ouch !!!!! epilating under my arms hurt initially they sore few days ( i very thick hairs ) . however , i got majority hairs after first time , i realized i'm never going shave again ! yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they all thinner much less painful . fact , sometimes it tickles little . :o ) i epilate there once twice week ( five minute job if you're careful , two if you're hurry ) i smoother underarms ! i used get my upper lip waxed once month . now i just epilate . it hurts , but just second . plus , i keep up it so instead 50 hairs pulled once hot wax , i only need pull 5-10 each time . ** word caution : our skin more sensitive some areas , so if you choose epilate around bikini line , careful . i managed give myself burn going too slowly rotating " blade " . now i just make sure i don't leave it one place more than couple seconds . if i miss some hairs , i come back time get them . this epilator comes little loufa pad help reduce ingrown hairs ( i've only few pad fixes them ) little cleaning brush . epilator very easy clean . top ( dark purple section ) pops off you run it under hot water . when it dries , you put it back . ** note , epilator not store hairs inside it . when they pulled out , they tend either gather front epilator ( i stop periodically wipe them off ) or they go flying . i sit towel when epilating catch most hairs . i hope this review helpful you your decision buying epilator . i am very satisfied this product i recommend it anyone who least little pain tolerance really wants get rid hair stop shave all time . ** few minutes pain worth it ??? absolutely ! :o )	1
i decided buy this product before i read reviews . my opinion trays stay better than strip kind . there alot whitening goo you press into your teeth it helps trays stay place . first morning goo came totally out my bottom tray but becuase i pressed too hard . i havent problem since . i noticed difference after 3 days they much whiter after 7 days . my gums turned white if whitening goo touched them full 45 minutes felt tingly hurt slightly . pick color returned within hour . it really isnt bad other reviewers make it seem . all all if you looking product works , this good one . i truly surprised how well they worked . i purchasing these future	1
this model all features elite 9500 ( 2 brush heads , 2 cleaning modes , programmable quadpacer , guage indicate how much charge remaining battery ) , but it $12 cheaper amazon ! all " programmable quadpacer " feature amounts ability leave it extra ( i.e. , fifth ) 30-second interval , or ability turn timer off so it just on/off . i regard most features functional ornamentation ( " bells whistles " ) , but elite 9800 also happens dependable , super-lightweight model run good three weeks charge only one person using it . i went three-week trip didn't bother pack my charger , it charge spare when i got back . note : i always allow nicd battery run all way down ( exhaustion ) before charging it , enhances both charge battery life . ( nicd only so many charge cycles . ) if this your first electric , you might like way it comes out box programmed gradually ramp-up power over first fourteen brushings . what difference 9800 9500 ? models appear identical . only difference i found one comes box says 9800 , other says 9500 . :-)	1

i purchased this hair dryer unusual reason : my old 1875 watt conair actually too much wattage my bathroom ( circuit kept tripping ) , so i actually looking dryer less wattage . however , i didn't want sacrifice power , i hoped not devote any additional drying time my shoulder-length hair . so far , i've pleased this hair dryer . it seem bit louder than my previous model -- not obnoxiously so , just higher , more concentrated fan noise . dryer extremely light compact ; it actually smaller than my folding travel dryer . it very basic , choice high/low settings only ( there no heat/cool option ) , but it seems dry my hair just efficiently my old higher-wattage dryer . overall , this very good basic hair dryer which gives you wide variety use options great price	-1

i tried ear thermometers never could get them work . our pediatrician used one these " rub across forehead " kind her office during checkup said it accurate ear kind much easier use ... especially when kids earaches ( ... grabbing itty-bitty earlobe sticking hard end into swollen , sore ear canal ??? ... ouch . ) minute practice ( after reading instructions ) , you get hang using it never dread checking temperatures again	1

i preemie who temperature needs monitored pretty much constantly . every diaper change we taking axial temps one those standard digital thermometers . torture ! took forever baby screamed her head off whole time . then my sister got this thermometer us it fabulous . what we like : 1 . when baby screaming , light blinks then goes solid when temp , great when you can't hear beep . 2 . it truly take second unless baby thrashing . 3 . produces long beep when you taking your own temperature , no guesswork when it finished which improvement over earlier models . what we don't like : 1 . preemies tiny ear holes . so we wait till our baby ear big enough able use this thing . 2 . lens covers pain switch out keep hand , it would nice if there way just sanitize lens after each use . 3 . we see discrepancy almost one degree left right ear which makes us question accuracy somewhat . enclosed brochure explains various causes this , but doesn't help when trying determine what exactly your baby temperature . we both axial ear temp found right ear our baby corresponds digital thermometer reading her armpit . however , enclosed chart shows variances oral , rectal , axial , ear temperatures which make it somewhat confusing . so we alternate digital ear thermometer just sure . i personally would recommend this thermometer older babies kids , just sure you test it out when kids healthy figure out your baseline what normal . it takes some investigation develop your method based what your needs , but it nice , quick use product my family loves using it adult temperature readings . we think we happier it when baby bigger we using it sick readings only	-1

i installed this unit my basement 6 months ago , it working flawlessly ever since . things i noticed : if power goes out , unit not turn back automatically ( some other units . ) if you want use continuous drainage ( which i highly recommend ) via hose , you punch out plastic disc side unit . i would designed screw-type plug replacable , but they didn't think . anyway , once you punch quarter-size disc out it out forever . if you choose use continuous drainage feature , you need pick up hose inner diameter 15mm ( . 59 " or just over half inch . ) i went local diy center found some clear tubing worked well . unit operate down 2-degrees ( 36-degrees ) , which great continuous operation garage keep tools rusting . three fan settings : med , high quiet . " quiet " really quiet , could probably work just fine bedroom . though , it warm room it . how much it warms it depends humidity setting . four settings : humidty level ( humidstat ) set " continuous dehumidification " ( which default setting ) , 50% , 60% 70% . fan continue run but dehumidification processor turn off when it reaches selected humidity level . cool . i mean , that when fan just blow room-temp air . full drainage tank stop unit illuminate " tank full " indicator ligh t.t he unit not heavy -- maybe some , but not nearly heavy some people make it sound . it 30.8 pounds . according instructions : you need least 21 cm ( 8 inches ) clearance front , behind side side . air blows out top unit , so you'll need make sure it clear well . there movable louvers top direct air straight up , 45-degrees or almost straight ahead . power consumption : cfm-25e 220w // cfm-40e 330wi highly recommend this model dehumidifier	1

shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like norelco those who prefer foil shavers . those you who like foil shavers , this one you ! i've owned latest braun 8985 it excellent , while it lasted ... charger kept breaking me ( once first month [ 11/2006 ] , then time 4 months later [ 3/2007 ]) . it expensive , refills pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided try norelco 8140xl ( speed xl)rotaries , while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got panasonic say it definitely shaves closer than both tried razors . they shave much faster than braun norelcos . i'm not sure if i like " side side " pivoting head , only time tell . heads don't pivot up down much braun , but once again , time tell if this necessary . one major advantage it cleans soap water ... no expensive refills hassle over . panasonic two noticeable downsides : 1 . it louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2 . you can't plug it shave ... you wait until battery charged charger disconnected turn it . this my favorite razor far .	1

this pedometer accurate you could reasonably expect . features suitable it even looks good . only problem i this product minor , it why i gave item 4 stars , rather than 5 . plastic holder/belt clip comes pedometer cheaply made very puny little spring . if you don't plan using belt clip , this definitely 5 star item . otherwise , just treat holder gently hopefully it last longer than mine , because omron won't sell holder seperately . holder only weakness speak if omron redesigns it , this 5 stars across board ( record , i wouldn't let my opinion holder stop me buying one . i'd make same suggestion anyone who fence - buy it .	-1

reading some these comments , after sampling hooah bar , i understand why these bars give you long lasting energy . they're oily sugary . lots sugar quick energy oil stays stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that why much fast food so popular , it tastes good its satisfying , but it ain't necessarily good you ! recipe makes it sweeter , certainly oilier , than eating ordinary candy bar . i think snickers tastes better . those who using these meal replacement bars , i'd real careful . bar might ' balanced ' but it isn't meal . whatever energy bar you consume , they're good before workout or post-workout recovery but don't confuse them proper meal all components found there . me , i prefer odwalla bar or cliff bar . less grease , true natural ingredients , less hype	-1

i drink lot bottled water . it not make me feel full - sometimes quite opposite . course , drinking water before or during meal lessens chance overeating , but effect skinny water goes beyond . i love its taste because it not overbearing too sweet like other citrus-flavored water i've tried . it replaces my soda curbes my apetite pretty well . i also bought bottle friend mine . he wondering why he wasn't getting hungry long time , only later realized it must skinny water . it costs quite bit . however , bunch drinks cost same negative impact your body . so , even if this placebo effect ( , fankly , i don't care long it works ) , i think it worth it . you'll judge yourself . i can't afford three bottles day , but buy this water sporadically , most likely my local 7-11 . i would like point out most people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like taste water , or never tasted it first place . course some people don't like taste - you can't please everybody - but it bears no relevance its efectiveness ! people who review stuff without trying it ... well ... they obviously don't understand what review means , too bad their preconceptions count towards overall score product	1

i'm 26m , 6 ' 185 growing . work out regularly , mostly weights basketball . i'm allergic peanuts , which makes most protein bars off-limits me . this only bar i've found where non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts peanuts set off my allergies . incredible , if only reason . but there more . 20g protein . wow . this meal replacement if you're road or it mid-morning , early-evening or even late-night snack , especially if you're trying build lean muscle shooting 1.5 or more grams protein per pound body weight . it easy 20 . carbs real , review says . it clean energy , effective either before or after workout . i prefer take liquid protein after workout , body absorbs it faster , but pinch this would great choice . beyond it little crispy little chewy , there physical satisfaction eating it makes experience complete . but , review said , this isn't intended diet bar , it men women who work hard use lots energy throughout day , hence name " builders bar . " i guess if you ate half one instead meal , it might work way . finally taste outstanding , when stacked against other bars ( although i haven't tried many , due peanut allergies ) . if you close your eyes pretend , it really could dessert . i stick cookies cream or chocolate . chocolate yummy dunked hot coffee mid-morning . i buy box every two weeks keep stocked home , work oftentimes one car just case i get hungry . review said outside chocolate got crumbly , this true , if it gets hot melted . when things solidify they crumble . doesn't change taste but it messy . keep them cool you're good shape . i've even tried putting them freezer prior eating , not bad but no significant difference . thank you clif	1
these bars absolutely fantastic . they very nutritious good amount protein ( 20g ) . they taste pretty good , far better than most bars . i prefer builder bar cookies cream flavor clif bar flavor . out flavors my current favorite cookies cream , next peanut butter , then chocolate . chocolate mint flavor just released but i yet try it . i recommend these bars anyone looking healthy snack or needing protein working out	1
i actually bought this book based all negative reviews it not enough " fill blanks . " i wanted baby book would give me topic let me journal it without too much prompting . there few fill-in pages ( see below ) , but most part i write my feelings thoughts my baby my own words . this seems like much more personal approach , one i think my son appreciate more when he old enough read it , than fill blank pages . previous reviewer complained pages thin newspaper-like . true , they simple white pages black titles , but pages themselves not all flimsy -- thicker than average novel page more like lightweight cardstock . illustrations small , simple , non-intrusive . black white line drawings more iconic than cutesy . my only complaint this baby book i would like more topics ( birth story , tooth chart , food , favorite expressions , favorite toys/games . . . ) however , pages look like they 11 " 8.5 " it bound ribbon , so i think little creativity , cardstock hole punch i may able add my own pages . topics covered ( one full page allowed per topic ): baby name ( fill blanks)family tree ( line illustration fill blanks)all momall dadexpectationsparties showers ( 2 pages)first impressionsbirth certificatehandprintsfootprintslock hairvisitors giftsfirst family photofirsts ( fill blanks)baby favorite thingsdoctor visitsgrowth chart ( fill blanks)medical records ( fill blanks)first birthdaysecond birthdaythird birthdayfirst vacationholidays celebrationsletter momletter dadkeepsakesreflections there also small pouch baby first haircut , pockets back store cards , documents other loose memorabilia	-1

i went too long without replacing blades foil my shaver . shaving getting real chore . but replacing these like getting whole new shaver ! it sounded felt different , i could feel i getting much closer shave . only reason 4 stars rather than 5 after month or so use , i noticed blades already dulled bit . i may start replacing mine every 6 months or so . but even then , compared what people pay those refills their fancy mach 7 nitro nuclear fission razors , i think we're getting good deal	-1

i offer this not professional opinion . there no consensus this . i just offer this off-the-record word-of-mouth opinion . but ... past several weeks , i heard few different psychiatrists i work , people i respect , tell me they patients who take omega-3 fatty acid supplements believe it helps mood stabilization . ( this , addition other well publicized below-the-neck benefits . ) so , take it what it worth . it relatively benign supplement , i've heard people worry mercury but it should filtered out any quality supplements . if it helps , great . if it doesn't help , no harm . probably . again , i'm not talking double-blind controlled studies , just cocktail party quality anecdotes . even so , i thought you'd want me share . they always say it better get your nutrition foods opposed supplements , but if you eat enough fish get same equivalent omega-3 fatty acids , you consuming some mercury . i'm not toxicologist , i don't know how big deal or isn't . given my off-the-record opinion , i'll now give my expert opinion : talk your doctor any supplements or herbal medications you interested taking . , please , talk your doctor if you feel you need mood stabilizer this hasn't professionally evaluated . if your doctor too much hurry , or too dismissive , time new doctor	1

i no idea why other reviewers commented smell parts this excerciser . it made steel except plastic pedals rubber floor grippers ( which work great way ) . rubber grippers come seperate plastic bag , which , when opened , smelled little bit like new rubber , but i don't think that even bad smell . anyway , this thing heavy enough durable enough replace excercise bike . let face it , how many people buy excercise bikes how many people don't use them after short time . there tensioning knob when tightened provides harder pedal , but now i'm using it more motion than tension , so i think this thing great	1

these great reading glasses . i'll down couple pairs these current 8 pairs regular reading glasses . here my list positives negatives . plusses :( 1 ) freak out all your friends when you pull them apart first time . ( 2 ) very convenient - i always them when i want them . ( 3 ) fit comfortably , easy adjust . ( 4 ) no more " hair grease " inside lenses . i don't clean them all time . ( 5 ) no more glasses falling ground ( top my head ) when i bend over . ( 6 ) great geek glasses ! negatives ( all minor ): ( 1 ) if your hair slightly over you ears , you might need " tweak " them occasionally when putting them your face ( i'm thinking i need haircut ) . ( 2 ) when reading kicked-back recliner , they tendency pushed out your nose bit ( i don't read recliner much anyway ) . ( 3 ) you may get annoyed first trying find them - when they're hanging around your neck ! (4 ) don't get clear frames if you're going use them bright fluorescent light setting - too much glare . ( 5 ) great geek glasses ! thanks clic	-1
[ ... ] i big head , i never wear baseball caps , but they fit fine , both ways . i easily gotten habit clicking them together dropping them down my neck . it freaks people out all time , which pretty funny ! i only wear them work , because size makes them not very portable , you can't keep them your purse . only thing really bothers me them , they get smudged easily because i touch them all time open close . also , admitedly , they little dorky hard wear pony tail . i usually slide them under my hair , it more comfortable . but , all all , i love clics . very best thing them i don't put my glasses top my head anymore . i hate way they would always get tangled my hair i rip them out ! ouch !	1
i want more . i want sunglasses ( i've checked ; they them ) sunglasses reading magnification included ( if they ) . they're not perfect , little crooked , given plastic one-piece construction no molding individual head possible , but minor gripe overall i love them . caught myself slipping pair old reading specs when clics around my neck . proof they . comfortable forgotten ! i'll picking some up gifts eye-weary friends	-1
i hate hate shaving my legs , seems i doing this everyday !!!! end same day i " prickly " . i originally saw this item qvc wanted it ( thought ice idea good one ) , but fearful pain i heard it caused . first time i used it , it bit rough but now several times later i don't even blink . i not used ice part since first use . hair grows back thinner i even recently attempted slowly introduce bikini line ! great purchase	-1
it very good product but ice not decreases pain . so you buy model less expensive . it very nice legs underarms , but not bikini .	-1
i am extremely pleased this product . understand two things : i am moving up electric epilator sugaring , i don't overly heavy hair growth . it works very well , even underarms which sugaring useless . i agree one reviewer folds tricky , but stretching skin helps . i didn't find ice feature all important , but then i sugared before so i familiar stinging ( yes it sting ) . i definitely used product much more than 15 minutes no motor problem , but i only owned it couple weeks so i not speak long-term durability . i would hope person motor trouble trimmed any really long hair(such bikini area beyond if you first time user ) before using because several machines recommend this however directions using satinelle ice six panel wordless cartoon left me scratching my head wondering " this joke ? " especially when warnings cleaning instructions multi-page , mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet : one quibble otherwise great product . there may better better epilator out there so read other reviews . i thought ice would better thing than it , but then i used stinging sugaring - if you never epilated , waxed or sugared - you may find it very important . i liked narrowness it bikini line handling . i wish it light like some other models . still , i am very pleased my purchase	1
my dad actually introduced me this stuff when i college , i am really happy . this stuff incredible getting rid headaches little boost energy when you hungover . only downfall some people whether or not they stomach it , because you drink it pretty quickly . but if you don't mind , then you luck . it works instantly too !! my only problem now i am possibly taking it granted i take it if i even slight hangover , when past i probably wouldn't use it . but just shows how well it works . *** alert *** it appears this product may not sold stores anymore . i've seen it pulled off shelves many drugstores supermarkets , so you may only find it online now . i don't know why , it probably wasn't selling well . maybe it isn't well known yet . my advice .... get it while you !!! it should fixture your medicine cabinet	1
after night out drinking ( red-eye flight or never-ending business meeting ) , alka seltzer morning relief must-have . whenever i wake up heavy head , achey muscles , hollow " i can't believe i polished off bottle red wine " feeling , i turn this stuff immediate relief . within minutes taking dose this fizzly , citrusy goodness , i'm back my feet ready go ! it not just good hangovers ! i bring this stuff me business trips when i find myself trade-show floor long hours get up 5 am after business meeting got out only couple hours before ... stay alert ready face long day , i reach my morning relief ! booze bags workaholics rejoice ! this stuff great	1

this really cool way getting your teeth clean short amount time . 2 speeds allow you start slow until your gums get used brush . i started faster speed love way my teeth feel after 30 or 40 seconds brushing . what really awesome you brushung upper lower , inside out one time . i recommend this all my patients they too really like how clean their teeth feel	1
without spend great deal professional whitening systems , these crest whitestrips pretty decent job . i personally would not recomment whole 20 day program though , because after just 3 or 4 uses you see some noticeable results without stripping too much enamel off your teeth	-1
i'm ex-dental hygienist who delved into depths people mouths 20 years , so healthy teeth mean lot me -- especially my own . when in-office dental bleaching first came around , i wasn't interested trying it because , time , i felt i really didn't need it . cost patients then close $500 . ten years later no longer practicing dental hygiene , i ready try some home products market . i regularly used , continue use , whitening toothpaste ( which basically just removes superficial surface stains coffee , etc . ) then i tried night effects " paint " liquid . besides gooey sort pain use ( not mention looking like cletus slack jawed yokel when i went bed -- not attractive look , ladies ) i really didn't see noticeable whitening . it couple years since attempt , so i ready try this product . but i tell you i found it half going price seller well-known online auction site ( which shall remain nameless , but you know one . ) you also go crest website right now ( may 2006 ) get coupon $7.00 off if you want buy it drugstore or supermarket . i found these strips easy apply , but someone large hands or not lot dexterity might bit difficulty . could overcome little practice . they " stick " quite well your teeth , but you also maneuver them around easily if you need reposition them during treatment . i haven't experienced much sensitivity after using them , i back-to-back treatments , which okay if you don't want space them out over course day . you even skip day if your teeth especially sensitive . i upper strips alone first ; way you lighten lowers gradually match upper better . most people aren't concerned whiteness their lower teeth because uppers more visible when smiling . i don't think you'll get " blue-white " teeth like ed mcmahon , but who wants anyway ? especially if you're over 50 , because let face facts -- there lot other things give away your age faster than less-than-white teeth ! ( now if they came out age defying face strips -- face lift box--i'll take one ! ) seriously , renewal whitestrips lighten up my teeth quite nicely got rid grayish look they taken over years also some yellowish areas where enamel become thinned . overall , i'm pretty happy product would use them again when my teeth , inevitably , begin look dull . ( oh , i'm going turn 60 next year , so i guess i official " baby boomer " spokesperson this product !	-1

this curling iron best market its teflon coating . it glides over your hair , leaving it shiny smooth curls . it never catches or tangles your hair super easy clean	1
this hair dryer never feels hot , even high setting my hair never feels dry ... which means frizz appear later . switches impossible operate if you even slightest amount hair product your fingers . instead taking half time dry , it takes much longer than my previous $19 blow dryer - or without ionic switch . also it awkward hold because " cool " button located right where your thumb should naturally go so you cramp your hand unless you want blown cool . not good product . i plan return mine try something else	-1

this nice variety oils , my favorite jasmine though , not sure how much i use some	-1
these oils seem higher priced , but when you consider they last so long , especially when using mister or water potpourri pot , they last you good long while . scents all aromatherapy types . my favorite green tea , it clean smell it . also , scents linger long after mister or pot turned off . i am always getting compliments how nice my house smells . when you consider glade and/or candles cost so much last such short time , these oils even better bargain . i order more when mine gone ( 4-6 months ! )	1
this wonderful item . we tried every kind humidifier tabletop ones huge multi-tank " whole house " type 2-4 large tanks roll around wheels . my main problem i only one strong enough fill carry tanks , so i permanemt " water carrier " duty . huge ones wheels i hooked up hose faucet dragged it humidifier fill it . what pain ! this kaz personal far best choice . it small tank , but it so light my elderly mother or kids fill carry tank themselves . it also cheap enough put one every room . it great travel ; just pop it your luggage use it hotels or wherever . we 1 each bedroom , living room , kitchen office . they last almost 2 years then it just stop steaming . larger , more pricey ones last same amount time but way more expensive replace . low setting it go almost 10 hours so size really isn't inconvenience . kaz used change style every year , but hopefully they'll stick this one . first kaz personal took 1 liter plastic bottle instead tank . great idea , but thinness bottle you use affected steam ; too thin walls water would run out , too thick nothing happened . i found myself supermarkets squeezing bottles if i picking ripe melon . now kaz personal its own small tank it absolutely best !	1

i lot research before buying new beard trimmer , it seems most panasonic beard trimmer best one available today instead usual names such norelco , wahl or remington . this particular model seemed best choice based not only it features but price reasonable too . best things this trimmer it cordless , there many settings beard length , there mini trimmer detail touch-up work , it quiet , charge holds long time---i've this trimmer month it still going only 1 charge ! drawbacks blades ( except mini trimmer ) aren't very sharp , you only adjust settings when it off , there more maintenance required than some trimmers require , you careful when removing attaching beard comb . i would say it worth checking out , but it definitely takes few good uses get used it	-1
i'm glad i got it . it light , looks nice works well . smaller head backside really makes difference when you're trying trim your mustache , etc	1
i bought product keep my hair shortest lenght possible . product what it designed , but pulls when going against grain . possibly dull blades or slow speed cutting	-1

i got this item idea using each piece stocking stuffer little girls - i put pretty pink bow each . it comes white cardboard box if given one child gift , it looks like you went got wholesale gift similar items especially since there big label bold capital letters reads " box sold 1 item not open " . best if distributed seperately . each piece cute within itself but too small hand out alone - best when combined primary gift .	-1
i enjoy how these glasses function . i don't lose them there no strings get tangled . people remark them . they little goofy , but fun goofy . enjoy	1
i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	-1

i bought this epilator 3 months ago here my thoughts it . pros- saves money razors- good large areas- entertaining if you're boredcons- no matter how many times you use it , pain not go away ( you drunk use it your bilini use tranquilizers use your armpits)- ingrown hair problem ( especially bikini area)- hair doesn't grow back much slower than shaving ( after two day you shave anyway smooth)- epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it , it just rips it .	-1

this shaveer given me christmas gift . i liked loook titanum blades remington line so i gave it try . i am overall very satisfied razor . company advises you replace screen blades every 6 months but retail store those cost over $25-35 . if you allow your facial stubble get too long this razor pull hair but no where near bad blade . i am pleased it it still shaves ok minor irritation but i not replaced heads screen yet . battery life i would rate very good this type shaver . if you very picky this would make good travel shaver if you not want take your clunky $100+ shaving system	-1

maybe my unit just defective , but here my experience this scale : first impression : it look beautiful . closer inspection : although it german company , manufacturing china . legs body cheap plastic . after switching pounds , i placed scale floor . noone standing , scale started displaying weight measurements quickly changing range 1 30 lbs . i figured it trying calibrate itself zero itself out ( manual not mention anything calibration or zeroing scale out , so i am not sure ) . couple times it display 0.0 , but then it would change again . after couple minutes doing this , scale turned off . manual says after programming , last keypress , it should show 0.0 , then you immediately get scale so it recognizes you next time . me , last keypress , it went back into " calibration " . make story short ... scale showed my weight 150 230 lbs different measurements ! ( my real weight around 210 lbs)at first i thought it problem " calibration " , so i tried resetting scale catching 0.0 reading before getting it . then i tried waiting , hoping it would eventually calibrate itself , but it would always turn off last reading not 0.0 , depending what point calibration stopped , you would get different range readings . getting scale , locks calibration , but even then consecutive readings measurements would vary within 15 lbs range . according soehnle website , accuracy tolerance those scales should within 3 increments . 2 , so even assuming it calibration problem , accuracy still unacceptable . warranty 3 years , not 10 stated amazon website . all features others rave , there ( aut o-o , auto-recognize your settings ) , just hold your fingers crossed it not defectiv e.p.s. amazon return policy it pays return shipping if product defective , if you just don't like it , you pay return	-1

electric razors usually not compete blade shaving cream but this one . results shaving this electric razor close shave no stubble 3 minutes ( heavy beard neck hairs growing sideways it gets them all ) . i know because it tells me how many minutes i used razor keeps track how many minutes left one charge , 60 minutes . self cleaning part works fine also but every time you clean you also charge batteries . cleaning every fourth shave means batteries not nearly discharged . i am concerned they get short memory . other than its great	1

this little different than i imagined it would . you're not going wipe it across your skin like cotton towel , you pretty much blot water off your skin - it stick drag across wet skin . once most water removed then you " towel down " like you're probably used . it very good job it absorbing water dries extremely fast . its very light weight even wet not weigh anything like wet cotton towel . it makes very good sports towel i'll probably taking one me now when i travel after experiencing " sandpaper " towels some motels . i also purchased pet towel different color , only difference it labeled " pet towel " but exactly same size material . overall i'm pleased them think their worth try but probably want large cotton towel my bathroom - i just like feel good rub down plush towel after shower .	-1
i love this towel . it doesn't leave lint . its lightweight yet very sturdy . its perfect size . it dries quickly feels good . if you never used microfiber towel before it little strange first but you soon grow love it . i not go back conventional bath towels ever	1

i bit apprehensive spending this much money acne " device " , but i desperate .. i big date two days i starting develop two large cystic zits right my forehead . i completely floored device , my zits gone day my date . zeno works described other reviews , i used it every 4 hours . i found it most effective immediately reducing swelling . i dont usually write reviews , but zeno definetly worked me i recommend it my friends . i started out 60 count cartridge , but refills only $25 , same bottle proactiv cleanser	1
zeno worked my cystic acne . it took four days , but cyst gone ! after first full day , there noticable reduction pain size . after two days , there just small red bump . three days almost nothing . fourth day , completely gone . best thing zeno treatments , me it immediately takes away pain cyst . it also reduced swelling much quicker than if i not use zeno . i friend tell me leave zeno place even after ending beep . tip seems get little warmer , but it seemed help my situation . i held zeno place until i heard continuous beeping . please use your own common sense this . i don't consider tip too warm , but some people it may too painful . i used it every three or four hours four days . i used it mostly pain relief cyst . i never expected cyst itself go away . 18 treatments cyst gone no scarring . wish i would this sooner . me it worked . i definitely not " one time it gone " experience . course , mine huge cyst ( one half inch wide ) my chin , so i diligent treatments , sure enough , it completely gone . i made sure i used zeno until there absolutely no bump left all . without zeno , it probably would taken more than week come ugly head , then month it heal ( probably scar ) . it worth it ? me it . i hate inconvenience going dermatologist then waiting office cortisone shot . also my dermatologist office closed weekends which according murphy law when i tend get monster pimples , so this perfect me . tips expensive , but considering cost gas , time , office visit , it still much cheaper alternative . thing i liked , i could use it over makeup . so , while i covered redness concealer , i still able zap cyst right over concealer . pretty nifty device	1
i bought this my daughters room i really like it . vapor stream shows it working soon you turn it within few hours my daughters room warm dewy . only reason i can't give this 5 stars after letting it run all night ( my mistake ) i woke up mess condensation all around base humidifier . table floor mopped up . i'd certainly buy this again but never run it long periods unsupervised	-1

my 2 year old son heavy wetter . after turning 2 he must started urinating more night , because he started leaking out his diaper every single night . we used all different brands , including luvs huggies regular ones . we went size 6 even though size 5 still fit . ( he slim ) . well ... still leaking . i decided get huggies nighttime diapers , but amazon didn't them anymore i couldn't find them our small town . after reading review , i decided try supreme diapers , they worked like charm ! he only leaked out these maybe 2 times , it 6 months . so i highly recommend . i love fit elastic band them . exterior so durable too . i let him run around these without shorts they don't shred like other brands .	1
i am very happy diapers deal i got . if you ordered $99 worth you got $30 free free shipping . i only wish they more selection sizes i ordered next size so they would come immediatley instead month later	1
my son fits into these diapers very nicely . he big boy , 11 lbs when he born . hard time finding diapers fit , still hold without leaking . these very nice , they fit perfect , they don't sag , or fall off . they cost little more than pampers , but worth money .	-1

i bought this scale week ago found it most accurate scale i've ever . it consistent one work i use , which weight balance type . i've found body fat measurement very consistent . tanita recommends monitoring yourself consistent time ( few hours after eating evening ) . i'm consistent . 5% . if i try it any other type , it same . not much variation . however , i am bit skeptical results . both my wife i fairly lean folks ( lucky gene ) . i fall under normal range ( 15%) . however , she consistently registers very low percentage rate ( 7%) - which neither she nor i believe	-1

so much easier keep your humidifier clean .. it really seems limit mold buildup . i would rated it 5 stars if it lasted longer than 30 days	-1
same experience earlier reviewer ... thing leaked like crazy after installation . washer didn't want stay place two pieces didn't thread together snugly . use plumber tape get it stop leaking , even then it touchy . worst yet come -- couldn't get darn thing hold itself upright . it very top heavy ( head size/diameter small pizza ) plastic components just don't support it . it flops forward no matter what we . that fine me , i'm short . my tall husband , it nightmare . after two weeks use , plastic piece holds showerhead cracked . i rubber band it together keep it functioning , which prevents me using it handheld . today , i'm sporting fat lip because thing popped out it jerry-rigged holder smacked me . needless say , i'm ordering something else today . it such inferior product i probably never buy waterpik item -- suspecting they abandoned any quality-assurance standards	-1
i purchased this showerhead after buying much cheaper one left lot desired ! friend white version this showerhead , it seemed like good fit my shower . i bought chrome version because i thought it would hold up better than white one . i really like showerhead ! it heavier than bad showerhead i before , but it works so much better ! it completely adjustable stays place without use any tools . i suppose it would tighter if i used tools ; however , package doesn't recommend it . overall , i think this worth buying	-1

received item record time , good condition . saved money buying replacement heads ( opposed buying whole new razor ! ) didn't go store store find them - good deal	-1
razor awesome . i replaced blades this replacement set , it works fine.amazon.com packaging tremendously wasteful . it mailed 12 " x9 " x4 " box , postage quite high . product itself size index card could sent cd mailer or " letter " -sized package . i understand efficiency they reduce number packaging options , but this seems little excessive . if you bought one cd , would it come foot-long box	-1
once , i don't " public service " going clifbar.com looking up ingredients nutritional information ; amazon.com it all top product page . now , i focus taste!that good thing , because this ( clif z-bar , chocolate ) one better tasting " nutritional " snacks its kind . it just enough chocolate ( brought you chocolate chips ( which include organic cane juice , unsweetened chocolate , cocoa butter , unspecified " natural flavors " ) actually impart chocolate flavor . not heavy or rich chocolate flavor , but unmistakable one : you don't close your eyes , convince yourself it chocolate . ( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1

this my daughter favorite perfume which she requested christmas i purchased it her	1
this biosilk makes your haie so soft silky . it really work	1
i longish wavy hair i color occasionally . my hair tends frizz up look frazzled out , even though i never use blow dryer . i tried lot different hair-smoothing products , shampoos conditioners leave-in lotions . but this stuff ! it makes my hair sleek silky way no over-the-counter stuff i ever found could . it not goopy or gel-ly or oily like many anti-frizz products . i think it silicone-based , so it just slithers onto your hair then makes it look like ' 70s shampoo commercial . ( if i also use straightening wand special occasions , it looks like " princess hair . " ) my hair also feels 500% softer than it without it . not just subtly softer , if you're paying close attention , but like difference those new kind plush toys extra-silky fur , compared old-fashioned kind stuffed-animal fur . ( i've guys compliment me softness my hair since i started using it . ) this " desert-island " product me ! i shampoo-sized bottle ( not sure exact ounces ) it lasted nearly two years	1
i really lot fun first month i owned it . two aa batteries lasted almost one month . compared other rechargeable models , this one fairly cheap . but after 5 months , now , it so annoying i change batteries every 3 days ! how come toothbrush eats up power so crazy ?! i'm thinking buying rechargeable toothbrush .	-1

i've used lot eyeliners my time . i prefer self-sharpening pencils used loreal , avon , you name it off shelf .. you use what you find like it , you know , until you find something better ... finally ! i found this vital radiance eyeliner one day decided try it . it more expensive than others , but i thot , why not try yet one . other ones seem harder or more waxy or something ... they just don't go smoothly they used . who knows , maybe my eyelids not firm they used ... but that better reason find eyeliner doesn't tug or pull . so even tho other ones say they're " kohl " eyeliners or " glide without tugging pulling " , hasn't case . so i decided try vital radiance one ... wow ... big difference ! i'm very impressed ! i've using these 7 months now , won't ever go back brand . it goes so smooth soft stays all day ... which difference others , they seemed flake off after midday . i sharpen it every 3 days or so , but it still lasts just long other ones . they're just much higher quality eyeliner , worth every extra penny . oh , they're just good anything higher-end you'll find department store . i just hope i keep finding them . hope this helps .	1
this great shaver . it quiet , it holds charge long time . ability wash hair off business end shaver convenient . above all , shave much closer better than expected . i highly recommend this gizmo	1
i hesitant buy this razor replace my 20 year old norelco triple header , but after charging it up using it , all my reservations gone . this razor shaves nice close extremely quiet versus my old razor ( it sounds so quiet , i think once while charge going down , but it not ! ) . ability rinse it out water clean it nice feature not mention i think it light weight easy hold . if you get past unusual looks , you'll like feel quality this razor it stays charged long time . ultimate test ? i'd buy it again heartbeat	1
this far nicest callus stone i ever used ! it almost produces " massage " like effect . highly recommended	1

i really like my new product . i using epilady least 10-15 years old . seems i it forever . it beginning slow down it not cordless . thought it time new one so i ordered it through amazon . com . i really like it also fact it cordless . there no going back razors me . new one seems more gentle than way my old one felt when i used it . can't say enough !! great product	1
i got tired shaving , so i switched waxing year ago hopes my hair would quit growing eventually . my hair grown back finer , but i still hairy legs most time because waxing never removed all hair before my skin gave out , or hair would grow back different rates . so i decided give epilator try . i bought one back 80 it medieval torture device . this new epilady great . it far less painful than waxing . i just feel slight prick rather than giant skin pull . it no worse than plucking eyebrow hair . charge lasts long time . i recently took it ten-day trip it never ran out . next time i won't even take cord . unit isn't very heavy , so it packs well . i am using it once week , i actually enjoy process somewhat . you careful stretch skin taut underarm area . i nicked myself one day soft skin there , but no problems legs . i also make few passes some hairs get them stand up catch , but it hasn't huge problem . i also like how i quick touch-ups my way out door if necessary . i couldn't wax . overall , worth money time	1

i used this product both my girls it godsend ! it small portable easily carried restaurant or friend house or your own dinner table . one simply take food one own plate put teaspoons selected fish , rice , veggies , fruit , meat etc into top grinder ... what emerges smooth , tasty real food your own plate ; just right baby palate . you choice blend fish veggies or grind separately baby . consistency food like mashed potatoes gives your baby chance accustom herself taste real whole foods , not pasturized overly seasoned , processed baby foods . both my girls adore vegetables result fed them their real form ( ground smooth ) happy baby food grinder . there no product i found convenient , or efficient feeding young babies food you select grind them . i applaud company made these great baby food makers over 30 years	1

i love idea epilator ... i waxing many years . this just easier than messing wax . so , i tried this one . it work very well . i bought this one price ( not sure if i would like epilator ) . i think i wish i purchased one light , only because i think this product which i use lot	-1
very few things make my list favorites but this little item just . this little pain-in-exchange-for-beauty -- convenience device several rows tweezers , which metal parts purple separators . they open up bottom close they come over top while they spin around separate directions , grabbing tweezing out numerous hairs fairly rapidly . it 2 operating speeds , fast or slow . ( 3 only if you consider off speed)i'm shaver , not waxer , i'd estimate my pain threshold average , but i wouldn't so much say it hurts much really stings , even my underarms , which really surprised me because i expecting lot pain when using this , especially my underarms . more hair you given region more you pull out same time naturally hurts more than when there fewer hairs remove . also , it hurts more pull out longer than shorter hairs , i'm not sure why . it definitely helpful stretch surrounding skin taut make hairs stand up little , but they still don't tend come out one pull . it sometimes take up four passes hairs coming up little more each time until they're out . i also noticed it better hurt less thicker , stronger hairs rather than finer ones ; still , i surprised how well it worked hairs seemed like nothing , barely visible first place . initially you may looking significant time investment get point where you're smooth shaved , me it equivalent time i spend entire week shaving spread out over few days . it really odd feeling , going stubbly smooth without actual shave . i got 3 4 times more hair removed than if i shaved , without nicks or cuts , giving me 3 times longer go until i remove those hairs again . six days later i went touch up hard put find anything remove . my legs underarms actually smoother than when shaved stayed way instead getting stubbly within few days , that why this made my list favorite things . now some recommendations : before you use this , let your hair get lightly stubbly but not overgrown state , once you use it you gauge yourself your own best level . you start using this while hair still shorter than when you might normally shave , its best way because even though you use it few days get all hair it cycles through growth stages removing less hair one time means less pain , that especially important when you're first starting out . i would also recommend showering or bathing exfoliating areas you plan remove hair first including washing off deodorant underarms but make sure your skin not wet or damp when you start because damp or wet skin more pliable means pinching pain during use . i seen models cordless state they used wet but i can't imagine why you'd want since it bound hurt . i've run this thing long periods time ( up 45 minutes ) but never problem jamming , probably because i clean exfoliate my skin first clean unit out after each use . first few times you use this your skin may become irritated bumpy , so i would not get this use immediately before big event or trip , i would want give myself minimum 2 4 weeks get used it , especially since you may decide you don't like it . it takes some time get as-smooth-as-shaved condition , so i would plan using it over course few days reduce irritation give some time hairs cycle through their growth stages become long enough remove .	1

i bought this cologne based many many favorable reviews . i over 20 major brand colognes this one my favorites . it almost identical acqua di gio except it kept check aspects di gio i didn't care . it just tad less sweet , perhaps addition grapefruit top notes gives it more sophisticated distinction di gio . there no unpleasant tones this cologne it seems last while . bottle stylish very tall compared all my other ones , but box pretty plain . it not quite casual hugo would work well when you must make good impression . it doesn't appear overdone popular some others , so you still mark your territory , perhaps because it bit pricey	1

cheap junk . we got this sale plus $10 off combined purchase so we paid very little , but even too much . it made so cheaply it falling apart inside package . this dollar store item , even then we would not recommend purchase . copper too soft , so you can't get any pressure . if you try use it , it bends arc , so you use it one second then you fix it use it again second . wood handle cracks slivers , metal ring base comes right off needs glued . sadly more thought went into package then product . pictures may worth 100 words , however item not worth dollar . avoid all cost . we would return it , but amazon charges us more return it then we paid product . however it may work whisk .	-1

my son rash cleared up . fragrance free . very good hands too when you out . i would recommend using plain water cotton cloth afterwards but these great when not available . they not stink cheap perfume like more toxic brands	1
these perform just aswell their chemically altered cousin	-1
i use these regularly also bring them trips everything messy	1
" painless plucker " isn't painless it isn't very good " plucking " either . it looks fairly sophisticated ... but it isn't . too good true ? yes ... if you're looking decent tweezer , best i've found diamond-coated tips ... i strongly encourage you find one these instead	-1
heel smoother just okay job . i disappointed	-1
i bought this advice friend who tried it loved it . i little reluctant after reading some other reviews , but my friend neighbor , cheryl , swore it . she bought similar product few months ago really disappointed it - so when she tried this one said it wonderful , i went ahead ordered it based solely her recommendation . i am so particular my feet i even trim my own nails before i get pedicure ! i only pedicure get dead skin off my feet , them smoothed enjoy experience . ( i live desert i wear sandals most time . ) so i would say i'm pretty tough cookie please . i got my heel smoother yesterday couldn't wait try it . it perfect ! fact i just called cheryl thank her turning me it . i love it so much i think i'm going get them my mom my sister holidays . i usually pay $28 - $40 pedicure - so after just one use , this paid itself i'm ahead game ! it took off all dead skin it didn't hurt all . unit powerful enough without scary ( when i tried dremel tool few years ago - disaster ! ) it actually easy access my heels this instrument ... i like way it shaped it lightweight . i really surprised how efficient it . cream comes it great , too . i put it before bed could really feel difference this morning . i sold cosmetics 25 years ago i know keeper when i see one . this awesome . i could sold ton these if they around back then . i believe expression " if you like what we , tell friend .... if you don't like what we , tell us . " i live - believing business owner , we would want know if something wasn't good . consequently , i always say when something isn't great , ( particularly food or service restaurant - since i wrote book business lunches ! ) so i also feel need share my opinion when i find something really super what it says it . i wholeheartedly recommend this . if you want your heels look feel nice , smooth keep them cracking , polish them down this fabulous instrument . then polish your toenails slip into your sandals confidence . i wish more women ( men ) would take better care their feet ... what i've seen , this heel smoother should mandatory	1
i tried many different types joint support formulas found them somewhat lacking their effect . after doing much homework research , joint vibrance offered exactly ingredients i would put my own formula . tried it within days , chronic inflammatory tendonitis joint pain diminished . great stuff	-1
i've it month now i say this great electric shaver ! i sensitive skin , but didn't any kind " break " period when i started using it . i owned electric shaver 10 years ago experienced two or three week period skin irritation . not so this one . fact , my face cleared up since i started using it . i used shave every other day my mach 3 razor avoid skin irritation . i not only shave every day now my braun , but i also shave again evening if i date . charge right what others mentioned . you get good 40 50 minutes shave time it . it shaves very close . my skin never smoother i don't put shaving cream or anything else my skin prepare it shaving . all you need dry skin your shaver . it take little extra effort my neck , but i've adapted over past month . i just shave it different angles , pull my skin tight , apply bit pressure . again , it very close shave . least good if not better than my mach 3 . also , like other reviews , i'm still trying figure out what braun thinking when they designed travel case . where am i supposed put my electric cord ? poor design travel case my only complaint this shaver . it very easy clean . don't spend extra money shaver cleaning solution you purchase again again . little practice , i've reduced time required clean my razor under minute . all you need hot water ! i remove foil cutting block clean them after every shave . i then leave parts counter next sink air dry . this great shaver i strongly recommend everyone who still uses blades	1
pretty inexpensive effecitve . takes few shaves get hang it . i never skin irritation again	1
shaver works fine , but name " rechargeable " bit misleading . it " rechargeable " replacing batteries , sense , every device relies battery power " rerchargeable " . this small stand-alone shaver , easy pack , convenient reliable . i use it standard shaver i don't shave while taking shower	-1
i love my little razor , but based upon amazon description ( not manufacturer description ) i felt i ordered razor rechargable batteries . unfortunately , device requires you go buy replacements lithium batteries every couple months . this direct conflict what amazon " chris " product reviewer says page . despite extra expense you'll buying replacement lithium batteries ( not cheap ! ) , it great shaver . i coarse beard i get very clean shave out this guy , it packs easily travel . very well made	-1
i shave once every two days decided try m3 power nitro ( black ) . it attracted my attention innovative idea combining regular razor electro-vibration , thus making hybrid . i'm not impressed it all ! i don't like it several reasons . vibration actually mostly reflected handle so i felt uncomfortable because it making my hand too shaky i'm 26 years old not drinker ! it doesn't cause cuts or burns but it felt really annoying my hand while shaving even few minutes later ! due better lubricator-strip it glides better , softer than regular mach3 but shaving performance same . handle grip ok but bit worse than regular mach3 because it doesn't fully rubberized handle bottom . it used mach3 cartridges , i tested shaved . while shaving i concerned not getting wet its battery compartment . i would rather use it regular mach3 razor , vibration turned off , but would not buy ! why pay more " fancy " but fact useless/annoying vibration function if regular mach3 practically same , if not better , job ?!	-1
my husband purchased this heating pad me . i neck problems needed new heating pad . first its takes forever warm up then it would shut off no reason . after two weeks , it would not turn any longer . this worst heating pad i ever used ......	-1
century ii good alternative century series which i consider too small my hands . black finish more comfortable than metal finishes	1
this replacement one just died . i my first one several years loved it . only problem you can't replace rechargeable battery when it dies . i guess keep toothbrush waterproof toothbrush sealed . i got manual toothbrush while then just sonicare back . i bought this one instead newer model , because i felt i didn't need extra bells whistles . basic model works excellently	1
whether you get basic model , or elite , nothing else works better . this my second model , battery finally quite old model after 5 or 6 years .	1
i bought this item ross 6.99 ... i wanted it before found it cheaper there . i love it . first it seemed kind small but i amazed how much i could fit it . it keeps food nice cold i no trouble ice ring or lid .. i highly reccommend it	1
i'm giving it 4 stars because , though not perfect , it good job money . re-arranging rocksyou vary amount splashy sounds . downside because ark-shaped bottom there willbe corresponding amount outside splashing . so you'll want use tray and/or absorbent mat . also , thereis slight motor hum but sounds water pretty much override it . ultimately , it help me relax	-1
i used homedics rock garden foutain but i didn't like too much because water would get everywhere . this garden leaves foutain , there no splash all . it uses same pump rock garden foutain it not really super noisy . rocks provided like rock bits though	1
i like auto shut off because i fall asleep it . i wish it little linger , though .	-1
we actually purchased this our cat . we kept it low heat she could curl up it during day if she got chilly , we didn't run up our heating bill heating entire house cat . she loved it , we love using it aching muscles ... works great	1
these items neat little towelettes their own handy little plastic container , come extra refill package . they very handy , work wonders insuring cleanliness . personally , i now consider them necessary part my toiletries ! down side , flushing these things * * result plumbing problems , i experienced . apparently , if your sewer line relatively new clear , they should give you no problems . but , if your system any place it where things collect , you face problems . according plumber , toilet paper begins break down quite quickly , but these towelettes take over month so . so , overall , i like this product , i recommend it . i just recommend if you live older house , you not flush them	-1
i work health so i recomend this product my patients . you use it before baby birth prepare nipples feeding , after birth protect nipples . there no cream like it , pure non toxic your baby when nursing . works almost immediately when your nipple hurts . you use it all times you want during day without washing or cleaning before feeding your baby . great product !!	1
these pull ups work great my skinny boy-hipped two year old daughter . they never leaked night they don't leave red marks . even size 4 they fit pretty snug so i wouldn't recommend them child " baby fat " like my older one . i use other ones pulled apart sides it comfortable fit . can't think name them , they may huggies , but they too big my two year old . hopefully these thing past soon . wish us luck potty training	1
ever since my daughter starts wear these , she refuse wear her usual pampers cruiser or huggies supreme . easy ups absorbs well . they look feel very comfortable . i love easy side-tear feature - perfect poo-poo clean up	1
this very convenient cost effective way get right size model razor heads . there so many different makes models shop store nearly always unsuccessful	1

this face scrub great use before shaving . scrubby balls within soap effectively break down tough facial hair letting razor get closer skin cleaner shave . i've using stuff since it came out , must 1� years now ... simply best . every man should it	1
i decided buy this heating pad strength number good reviews , although i noticed there some people saying they felt pad highest setting didn't produce enough heat , others said it " really hot . " anyway , my pad certainly doesn't get nearly hot i'd expect it . it very disappointing , actually . i don't know if it defect , or if there variations individual items this regard , but it hard me imagine how anyone could possibly say my pad gets " really hot . " i'd describe it more " luke-warm " -- that highest setting	-1
i several these sunbeam soft heating pads . i already used this new one high setting pretty hot , thus i am using 3 4 heat setting . i like new fancy control too . i like i put it 2 hour setting or continuous setting too . i am hopeful they " bugs " worked out control system it usually what goes bad ... i am going hold my receipts packaging just case this one goes bad too . i tried other brands this same type heating pad control them goes bad too . probably all made same company .	1
i through many trimmers many different brands . i used enjoy norelco trimmers but since they moved production china their entire product line going downhill . after few bad decisions i finally came this wahl . it right choice . it trims well efficiently many included combs . build quality very solid . it also one last wahl products made usa . only qualm i it not able accept worldwide voltage . my old norelco austria this feature but their new products single voltage too . oh well . over all this trimmer highly recommended	1
i user straight razors , then battery operated shavers which not give me efficient shave day they irritated my skin badly . when mach 3 came out i tried-it i'll damned it worked good , it kept my 5 ' o'clock gone 2-days . when gillette came out mach 3 turbo it revolutionized shaving it soothed my skin each pass vitamin . but i think next time i'll buy m3 power , it better cartridge ( one came m3 turbo cartridge box promo ) . i may also try fusion but wait until they drop price they too expensive . til ' then i'll stick m3 turbo power	1
this only blade i'm allowed buy my husband . he normally shave least twice daily but these blades allow him go all day without second shave . they don't tear up his face process either , but get it so close he doesn't worry rushing home shave again . truly great product well worth price . it great ladies too	1

great idea . bought two pairs clear frames got free shipping . my husband always misplacing his reading glasses . these hang around your neck you lift them up they clic together nosebridge . would nice if they came out more variety styles . noticed several tv personalities using them also .	-1

rechargables last only 1/10 time regular battery . two small children lots toys need batteries , i extremely excited getting rechargable batteries . however , i used them one my daughters toys shocked when they needed recharged 2 days . regular batteries last 3 weeks . i called energizer they confirmed rechargebles not last long . regular battery 22,000 mah versus rechargeable 2550mah . think before you buy	-1

this chair like high-tech cocoon massage , it amazing . first , looks : good leather , deep black , overall chair looks like it high quality , like you paid $3k it . construction seems quite solid . chair take up good bit space , perhaps 4 feet wide full extension 6.5 feet long . function : control panel pretty extensive , sort quick massage functions swedish etc , well controls picking out specific areas focus . so you go pre-built massages or use customization create one spot what you need ( save it ) . customizing massage takes probably 20 minutes tinkering figure out , so not totally easy but certainly not hard either . only negative i see it chair clearly designed people under 6 feet tall . i am 5'10 just barely get my legs fully extended chair , so it works but would not if i 6 ' . so seriously , don't get this if you tall , it just frustrating . overall chair well worth it us , chair purchased ease back pains after giving birth carrying around baby months , quite well .	1

these panasonic 8100 series shavers excellent but you save bit some shopping . this shaver essentially same panasonic es8167a arc shaver ( i believe only color different ) . you also find this amazon ( i more complete review there ) . this model sold certain high-end catalog $249 but purchased much less through amazon . during christmas , it down $99 this included vortex cleaning station . i believe it bit more now , but still worth comparing 8168 if you want save bit	1

but i love this cologne . it hard review something like this considering it all smells different different people , but black code nice , mellow scent isn't overpowering or distracting all . i get so many compliments when i wear this out . i'd compare it preferred stock , but less potent . black code little more than i'd normally spend something like this , but it worth it ! while no cologne guarantee someone tear off whatever clothes you're wearing just your scent , this one definitely inspires compliments people !	1

i bought this model refurbished $70 i'm highly disappointed . good point razor definitely very quiet , but it not cut close all . also , i don't know why new one comes all cleaning equipment , when refurbished model i got says just rinse it water came no cleaning unit . i've only used this few days , i'm not willing " allow 30 days my skin adjust " because my return policy expire . so i'm returning it . i've using previous panasonic model over year gives me closer , better shave than this razor .	-1

this my 3rd braun within last 10 years . i tried other brands , but they just don't measure up . braun gives me closest most comfortable shave ever . also , cleaning/recharging system works very well	1
funny , i read some reviews here , wonder people who reviewing product . * i own different razor , but am reviewing this one ... * you can't get it wet , but it doesn't say product manual ... * you replace " expensive " cutter/head every 18 months ... * cleaning stand too large ... good grief , this stuff made up ? it cannot real , it ? " here your sign ... " any these people any research before purchase ? you see this thing any wal-mart or target america .... i think these people who sue companies ' hot coffee ' .... sheesh . come , folks , it razor ! i used norelco wet/dry years , never quite satisfied . too many passes , razor burn bad . so , after dropping it floor breaking it beyond repair , i tried this . rebate amazon , it less than franklin bill purchase shipped ! razor great ! almost close blade . after 6 years navy , where i learned hate shaving _every day_ , i am finally doing it again , no problems . there no ' tug ' like lift cut norelco , i get less ingrown hairs , continuous problem lift cut system . ' hum ' braun different than ' whirr ' norelco , but no louder or more annoying . cleaning stand great . i clean all whiskers my razor brush before putting it stand , then remove cleaning fluid after cleaning slow evaporation . i easily get two months , perhaps 3 cleaning cartridge , 6 days week shaving ( i skip saturdays ) . after trip , deep clean makes this razor sparkling new ! long run , disposable razor , or even mach 3 replacable blade , cost 50 cents day . ( including shaving cream , hot water , etc . ) heck , say 20 cents day . after year , 20 cents day adds up $70 ... i got this convenient razor ( i use it car , my desk , bathroom , etc . ) just few dollars more than . even after replacing cutters 18 months , i come out ahead $$$ . no-brainer . electric razors environmentally friendlier than disposable razors , cost effective , just close blade newest technology . yourself favor ... get into 21st century , buy this razor , or buy norelco , but give up bic , cheapskate !	1

i really love this hot air brush ! i thermalaire previously it low powered i could only use it style my hair after i dried it regular hair dryer . after it died , i decided try this one because it 1200w -- wow , what difference ! it attachment allows you use it regular hair dryer , or you dry your hair using brush attachments . i short layered hair i usually dry it using larger brush attachment . it gives my hair so much body , its just wonderful , it dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer i've ever . first day i used it , when i went work people kept complimenting my new haircut !! i keep telling them it wasn't new haircut but new hair dryer ! i haven't bad hair day since buying it ! only problem i've it tend get little hot handle high setting , but it worth it me because it dries my hair so fast , while styling it same time . i always turn it down low setting if i need . it also cool setting set your curls . this great item i just wanted contradict some negative reviews it gotten . this great dryer people who short time need great style fast !	1

aqua-jet foot spa some great qualties . such rotatable aqua jets , which work really well . they only two front where your toes though . i wish they something else back . overall spa what it says but massage nodes help relieve stress hard too feel when you roll your feet over them . it kinda struggle i friend try it she said same . heater work well long you put luke warm water start . if your looking relaxing foot treatment practically knocks you out relaxation , this it . it may just little too pricy	-1
my wife wanted foot spa i began my search via web noticed most people weren't pleased their foot spas they complained loud noises , jets ( i.e. bubbles ) not powerful , or just plain cheap . i decided give sharper image or brookstone try . sharper image claimed their spa kept water warm but out stock ( good sign ) but i wanted one immediately gave brookstone try . my wife loved it ! she frequents nail salons pedicures stated this machine just like ones salon regards features comfort . she very thankful . i also experienced jets water temperature it works advertised . you won't dissatisfied . there cheaper ones but imho this worth money . enjoy .	1
i've this dispenser my master shower almost 8 years all bottles deliver liquids like when they new . only problem i've deterioration over time fog-free mirrors . however you order replacement under $7 ( plus shipping ) . i'm process replacing my second mirror , so they lasted average four years . not bad !	1
both my husband i very impressed this product . there no more clutter our shower , it very easy install use . my husband loves mirror shaving , we gone through many other types mirrors all which failed stay secured our shower wall . i love everything one place there won't any more wasted product . i'm sure you know most shampoos coming pouring out their bottles you use much more than you need , this you won't problem any more . i highly recommend this product	1
aquis hair turban very quickly dries medium length hair just right amount leave it damp enough styling . i found i prefer using this rather than aquis towels my hair , they tend leave it too dry my needs . towels great drying off drying wash wear hair styles , but hair turban much better if you need your hair damp enough set , blow out , or otherwise work .	1
i love this turban . i used one every day last 7-8 years it stayed great shape . unfortunately , i accidentally left it hotel , so now i'm ordering 2 more . turban holds hair securely dries it well , compact ( takes almost no space luggage -- convenient frequent travelers )	1
i worried reading lack steam reviewer but most reviewers seemed happy it , so i bought it . using plain tap water ( our maryland water hard ) , inhaler made strong , gentle , steady steam less than 45 seconds . steam lasted 9 minutes before it decreased . i would like steam last longer but it trying breath fast deeply i could , i almost hyperventilating 9 minutes . unit cool down before you add more water you warned not over-fill unit . mask made soft , flexible plastic so it comfortable . i found it easiest just hold unit my face , since resting it tissue box caused me bend down . you probably need extension cord , since cord not very long ( if you using wall outlet ) although if you using higher bathroom outlet , it would fine . it very easy fill - open white top , unscrew lid , add measured water , put back together , turn . only little complaint you should disassemble pieces let them dry , so i leave unit pieces towel dry day . i always hated using old fashioned method putting my head over boiling water towel breath steam . this much nicer my face didn't get hot or feel burned . i found this inhaler comfortable convenient . i cold using this unit three or four times , i didn't get sinus infection i think it helped cold less severe go away faster . i also rinse my sinuses neti pot baking soda/salt solution very warm water . i used neti pot before still got sinus infection but this time using steam inhaler , i didn't . people sinus problems , allergies , or prone cold , i think using neti pot rinse your sinuses very helpful . i read it " sinus survival " book my good friend said she hasn't sinus infection years since she started using neti pot every day . i only use neti pot when there lot pollen , after yard work , lots people ( especially sick ones ) , when i stuffy nose or feel " something " coming	1
design quickly makes dense steam which lasts 10/15 minutes per charge tap water additive liquid your choice . i used others can't make dense steam this one . it worth price . you it long time	1
i thought this scale good while . it looked good . then i started getting odd readings . within five minutes , it would give me two different weights either 4 or 5 lbs apart . ( i would it over over scale seemed not able decide ) . i tried new battery , it not help . ( before i noticed this problem , i actually told friend get this scale , too , she reported same problem ) . i've tried moving scale , resetting it , everthing . nothing seems help . i am now shopping new scale	-1
i love this scale . it smaller lighter than most it seems accurate , i just wish it nicer me ;	1
very nice scale money , it exactly what it supposed . it accurate it pretty sturdy , i would definately recomend this product	-1

i my air-o-swiss 2 winters now . i live north east winters very dry . we only tend turn humidifier during winter times so far humidifier working good new . i not problems white powder some reviewers mentioned i change demineralization cartridge every winter . cleaning breeze i think it helps fact i use purified water refills . not sure if this recommended but i not see any lime sclae build up result . already mentione dby others , humidity level indicator not accurate result , i went out invested small amount money get seperate indicator . i found hygrometer $5 sears i tend go reading rather than built one . i think price costly but fair . you get what you paid . quiet , nice looking humidifier easy clean maintain	1
after using several other humidifiers , most which lasted only few months before breaking , i decided bite bullet try expensive one . after considerable research , i chose air-o-swiss . so far ( two months ) it seems well worth its high price . it far easiest live any console or tabletop humidifier i've owned . it performed beautifully my modest 15 ' 15 ' bedroom . no problems over or under humidification . no white dust ( so far , least ) . no more morning sore throat , dried out nasal passages or hacking cough , either . further , it blessedly quiet . admittedly , my others not ultrasonic devices , so i can't compare other machines using same technology , but compared standard evaporative units this silent delight . tank large enough it needs filled only once or twice day ( except during extremely cold weather ) . filling it presents no more difficulty than any other unit i've owned . i like easy use , well designed automatic mode , well option warm or cool mist . i use warm while i'm sleeping , cool reduce operating costs when i'm not room . ( it 24/7 because i'm home all day . ) downside , it expensive buy maintain ( filter cartridge refills sticks overpriced , but they work well ) . high maintenance cost reason 4 rather than 5 stars . addition , it occasionally slightly moisten rug nearby , although not consistently never enough soak through ( instructions warn against using it floor , so i knew i doing so my own risk ) . tank removal replacement process inevitably results few drops dripping floor , too . no leakage problem , however . overall , though , air-o-swiss great upgrade virtues greatly outweighing its minor imperfections	-1
after countless nights interupted sleep , i now wake refreshed . other reviews helped me choose this product . i chose 7135 model over 7133 added features , am glad i . sleep mode great . i am light sleeper , but this unit extremely quiet . resevoir need filled each day , but one reasons i purchased portable unit addition my whole house humidifier --- adding extra moisture my bedroom . it simply too dry . my husband , buzz saw , snores much less now lot quieter since purchasing air-o-swiss . thanks all who gave this unit 5 stars . it made my decision easy	1

30 seconds into my first shave , i knew i made great choice my new razor . now , three weeks later , i'm even more elated than i during first shave . after using braun shavers my last two , this panasonic revalation . i researched new shavers couple hours , narrowed it down this panasonic comparable ( comparably expensive ) braun system . perhaps latest braun would made me happy , too , but i won't switching back . what i like es8162 ? starters , blades move consistent speed , which higher than my old braun . blades maintain speed , even when shaver battery low , something plagued my old braun , which end i keep plugged 100% time . consistently high speed panasonic means less razor burn , least my face . other thing i love able shave wet or dry . i thought this " nice " but i quickly become addicted shaving wet , my geo . trumper shaving soap real badger brush . talk crazy combination retro modern ! but glycerin-based shaving soap feels so much better my face , leaves it smooth clean , perfect lubricant shaving panasonic . shaving brush pure indulgence . i used hate shaving . i wouldn't say i look forward it now , but it certainly become experience its own modest pleasure	1
i like these rollers because they little teeth them holds hair so they won't slip out . it take them while heat-up , but i usually plug them ahead time , so it doesn't really matter me . clips easy use keep rollers place . i've tried rollers covered velvet material , but they just didn't hold hair place . these my favorite so far . my only complaint i wish extra rollers clips sold stores , but you order them directly conair	-1

i've never used at-home microdermabrasion kit before so i can't really compare it others ( yet ) , but after my first try 2 weeks ago i loved it . my face felt baby soft like never before . i couldn't stop touching my face 2 days shocked everytime how great it felt . but after 2nd day using it ( i it 5 days row because i don't sensitive skin ) , it didn't feel great ( but i didn't break out or anything ) . i finished up 5 days while my skin feel softer than it before i started this , it wasn't silky smooth it after my very first use . i notice my blackheads visibly reduced -- even tough ones my chin . first time i used it , i just rinsed my face went sleep . i didn't use any lotion because i oily skin residue microdermabrasion cream left my face not dry . second day , i used my blemish extractor sephora blackheads came out very well cleansed murad pomegranate face wash/toner . fyi - if anyone extractor , i find " whitehead " loop works better extracting blackheads than flat blackhead loop ( which scrapes irritates my skin ) . anyway , it 2 weeks i've lazy try it again my skin back square one . i'm not sure if i'll start over 5 days row thing again or just it 2 or 3 times week " maintenance . " i'm thinking ( if i time ) doing microd , extract , then clay mask or peel . sorry write novel , but last note i just want say even if effects aren't long term , it sure felt great skin teenager again ( if only 2 days) ! if anything , it best exfoliator i've ever used ... even better than aspirin mask , imo . i would definitely buy this product again , but i think i'll try other brands first see which one best . first time , though , this great experience	1

i also their conditioner - love this shampoo ! i cream de coco absolutely love it ! it really light my scalp it doesn't irritate it all - recommend more bumble bumble products anyone	1
first off , i'm actually my 20 but i'm lazy set up account right now . anyway , i picked up this kit walgreens other day . it marked down $20 $15 so i thought i'd give it shot . high prices whats always kept me trying other teeth whitening products , but i decided i could handle $15 . my teeth weren't too bad , but they little yellow especially my lower teeth gum line . gel doesn't taste good , but i didn't expect it . nothing dentist ever puts my mouth tastes good , so i didn't expect this any different . however , it doesn't taste awful . i didn't tooth or gum sensitivity till last round but it tolerable . i noticed pretty big difference my teeth ... my top teeth almost pearly white while my bottom teeth now one uniform color , instead yellower gum line . i pretty happy results spending $15 only taking 2 hours . i some bad gum pain following day however . it only bad one day , but discomfort didn't go away completely probably 3 whole days . however i don't think i washed gel thoroughly enough space my gums my lower lip since only place i pain , so my fault .	-1
i like shave shower tried linear foil we t-t o-dry shavers ( braun panasonic ) . this first rotary shaver i've owned it pretty good . nothing like blade , but i believe this product shaves faster than braun panasonic more thorough . if you can't closeness blade , least go fastest shaver . don't believe hype - none them shave " close blade " . p.s. built lubricating lotion plus when you don't want pack shaving cream those weekend trips - it trick .	-1
this shaver terrific provides close shave- but doesn't leave your skin raw or irritated if used shower shaving cream . i used wet/dry shaver over 10 years , panasonic foil ( which cut my face)to remingtom ( no longer available ) norelco ( best ) . i shave shower shaving cream never use it dry . using it wet shaver , i no longer trouble shaving my neck , or shaving when it hot or humid . i no longer breakout irritation no longer raw neck . i also find rotary superior foil my facial hair , this shaver meets my needs . i highly recommend this shaver anyone who uses shaver instead blades recommend anyone even least trouble using dry shaver try this wet shaver	1
this shaver performs extremely well . shaves close razor , full charge lasts entire month , longer if you dont shave every day . instructions absolutely correct , it takes few weeks get used it , so dont too put off if your first couple shaves uncomfortable . if you more sensitive skin , i would stongly recommend using minimal pressure first , even if means not getting closest shave . once your skin adjusts , you still get shaver burn if you press too hard , especially neck , so resist any urge grind shaver into your beard . despite providing incredibly close shave , it sometimes fails grab every hair first couple passes its little tricky maneuvering around strong adams apple . after taking those shortcomings into account , its still superior every way other shavers ive used : top model braun foil shaver , couple cheaper norelco models . while doesnt qualify me authority shavers , i appreciate when product basically lives up expectations . even though 9160 isnt quite perfect , it comes through reasonably fast , close comfortable shave . here few tips should help , especially when starting out : 1 ) shave before you shower . shaver works better stiffer beard your face less sensitive . 2 ) shave every day if you . longer your beard , more hair gets missed . 3 ) if any hairs get missed after couple passes , leave them . its not worth getting every hair exchange shaver burn . you get more experienced shaver , youll get better using it . touch up rogue whiskers sideburn trimmer . 4 ) this shaver trouble longer hairs lie flat . if you spot any after your first pass , use sideburn trimmer shorten them before touching up rotary blades . if youve already made couple passes before you notice them , refer back tip #3 . 5 ) keep tension setting normal . if you set it sensitive , you just press harder make more passes get good shave . 6 ) if you still trouble shaver burn , use little apple cider vinegar aftershave . yes , it feel like your face ripped off couple seconds . if youre not fan sensation , you may dilute it . let it dry completely , then rinse it off . its best solution ive tried minimizing razor bumps , ive tried them all	-1

after regaining most weight i lost doing atkins diet ( gain due medication facial/jaw injury ) , i pretty upset . i didn't really want atkins again because high fat low fiber content read some pretty scary things atkins i wanted lose weight again , but more healthy fashion . i heard hoodia product bought some back-up my new lower carb , low fat high fiber diet . what i've read , i'm doing " south beachie " sort diet . my weight loss much slower , but i feel much better . thing i've noticed since i started using hoodia product , i don't desire induldge " neurotic nibbling " which bug-a-boo mine years . i really don't want eat much . i only eat enough . i think hoodia responsible my changed eating habits . weight stats : 69 " tallbefore atkins 170 - 175after atkins : 145 - 150after jaw/facial injury meds : 163 - 165i'm now hovering around 158 pounds . i think hoodia helping	-1
this my first time trying hoodia gordonii . i am bulimic desperate something curb my nightly binging . i bit skeptical first because mixed reviews overwhelmed number different brands claiming only " true pure brand . " i went dex-l10 because i didn't want one too weak or too strong first . first time i tried it during mid-afternoon no desire eat rest evening . 500mgs seemed work fine me but i small frame am normal weight , if i feel i need it stronger i always take two . i understand if you're overweight it might take much higher dose get same effects . what i've read , some people need 1000 mgs 3 times day others could get 400mg still lose weight . i think this good brand because there no other ingredients so you get full effect figure out how much works right you . effects kinda subtle . i still eat food while taking it but i am not constantly thinking food every five minutes like i used . i also try eat very healthy exercise begin , most important thing , so i would only recommend hoodia someone who needs extra push stop eating obsessively . it not " weight loss " pill per se , but one could lose weight it realistically . it only appetite supressant which why too many people disappointed when they don't lose weight . emotional eaters known eat even when they not hungry . it works , but don't expect it magic cure everyone .	-1
i tried hoodia gordonii must admit i am not hungry . i so far lost 10 lbs , it so easy . if you looking appetite suppressant this item works highly recommended ............. june 30th i lost total 25 lbs ......... keeping mind hoodia not work itself , rather you must eat healthier but if you snacker like me , it great	1

i bought this air bed january i decided not write review until i used it some time . i sleeping it every night since i bought it . it almost half year i still love it . this air bed very comfortable durable . i only pumped air few times past six months . important thing remember when you use any air bed air bed not iron bed . air bed like balloon , but much different shape . if you know how not make balloon burst , you should same your air bed though air beds more durable . before you pump up bed , you've got vacume your floor make sure there no hard sharp particles which may prick your air bed cause leaks . this very important extending life your air bed . i always take off my shoes door when i come into my house . so i less chance bringing sand , dust , dirt so into my house . result , my floor clean . still , i vacume it every now then maintain it . if you wear your shoes your house , you should always make sure floor space under your air bed clean free sharp or hard particles any kind . they may so small you can't notice , but vacuming floor very helpful prevent your air bed damaged	1

after lot searching , i finally found product i wanting . brush holds many layers my shoulder-length hair , larger diameter , it results soft curls curves . it heats up quickly , plus it plastic cap end so i don't burn my fingers . i highly recommend this hot brush those longer hair don't want tight curls .	1
i love this curling brush . it heats up super quickly , so many settings turbo heat button extra shot heat hard curl areas . i use it morning straighten out kinks sleeping , straighten smooth my hair , flip it under or out , or add some waves . it nice long cord , too . i think brush less damaging than curling iron because there no clamp you don't hold it same place long . if you haven't tried brush , this one try . note this brush heats up , not brush blows hot air - it use dry hair only .	1
this product job i wanted it . seller also very prompt i would use them again	1

our mattress only 5 years old , but last year , my husband i haven't sleeping well our bodies aching every morning . when we received this mattress pad early christmas gift , we thrilled ! once he got it unpacked laid flat , it took very little time fluff up . i slept better very first night when i wake morning , i'm not stiff sore all over . it made huge difference just last week . i concerned it wouldn't fit under our sheets , but we've no problems either . it simply squishes down corners us fit sheets over it . i would highly recommend it anyone	1
i disapointed performance this poduct . it absolutely not provide 100% lift . 75-80% . also seat small one built up 300 lbs . lets face it , if your near 250lbs up , your bottom much larger than seat resulting , hanging over edges . it very uncomfortable any extended period time . seat hard not padded well . also , " recliner " type chairs it says it work , not totally true . levers opperate seat either side , but if you sit lift recliner chair " sinking factor " hinders use leavers , makes it difficult reach them . we found it very frustrating extremely disapointed ! this not worth $ our oppinion . it would huge improvement widen seat , add more padding corded seperate remote instead leavers seat itself	-1

i've never tried any other brands pre-electric shave conditioner , but i so displeased my new electric shaver i decided give afta try ; i chose " fresh " scent . ( it kind silly name , since " afta " makes you think " after , " you're supposed use it " before " ! )afta given me dramatically closer shave , one more comfortable , too . it made difference unacceptable shave acceptable one . bottle says , it non-greasy formula . it doesn't appear clog razor heads , also claimed . i've only using it three weeks , so it may too early tell . only drawback , which i consider minor , fragrance rather strong . it reminds me inexpensive after shave lotion . it doesn't dissipate my post-shave rinse water ; you would probably need wash soap water make it completely go away . however , i'm so pleased improvement quality my shave lingering aroma doesn't bother me least	1

when you buy this product , you certain your expectations properly set . it not vacuum cleaner won't pull dirt out carpet . it isn't even traditional carpet sweeper rotating brushes lift hair surface dirt into chamber emptying . what carpet flick good picking up surface dirt litter . it no moving parts , so it depends ( 1 ) rolling over litter sticks up above surface carpet , or ( 2 ) litter light enough so small internal " breeze " moving unit back forth causes enough flick dirt into upper container . i used this unit extensively since i purchased it . i truthfully say it wonderful job cleaning up tremendous amount environmental " stuff . " compared small casabella brand carpet sweeper which i used before i bought this product , carpet flick much better job . i am very happy product , even though i recognize it not ever replace good vacuum clearner ( or even well-built , full-sized carpet sweeper ) . so keep your eyes open your expectations calibrated when you hit " buy " button this product	-1
i started using panasonic shavers 20 years go after trying almost every brand . this probably my 5th panasonic . it gives closest shave any electric . only problem you cannot skip more than one day or you need use blade or norelco catch longer hairs . if you wondering why this my 5th it because it cheaper replace entire unit than replace parts	1

my wife cut my hair 4 times using andis cordless hair clipper kit . it works well held charge least 1.5 hours so far . i not suggest using either straight comb ( points too sharp ) or scissors ( too dull which pulls rather than cuts hair ) . however , clipper itself comb attachments all work advertised . so far kit more than paid itself since i save $18 every time i use it .	-1
i owned these clippers nearly year . they cut just precisely now they when i bought them new . wide blade very nice requires less strokes . i use these clippers once week clean up my fade/blowout . they cut really thin , thin barbers , only they not cut razor thin . i yet see anything cut razor thin besides razor . these clippers closest you get barber chair your home . i am so sold quality this brand/line i just purchased " improved master clippers " accompany my " t-outliner " . it set me back hundred bucks but if it all like t-outliner than i extremely happy . you get what you pay oh yes , don't forget keep them oiled !	1
dryer very quiet powerful . easy install . night light nice green glow . highly recommend this product	1
my wife i very satisfied dryer so far . each us uses it every day . it isn't quiet we hoped , but it still fairly quite . more importantly - it works fine main thing . couple points . note 1 : night light pretty powerful stays all time , night or day . not big deal us . note 2 : installing it bit hassle , especially if you not screwdriver magnetic tip , you thread each 2 screws through two mounting brackets , screws kept falling out . i finally gave up one screw , but dryer still secure wall . note 3 : this dryer replacement wall-mounted unit just died less than 2 years . we this one 3 months - so verdict still out its lifespan ..	-1

this product sounded great , that what interested me , however it big disappointment . i tried carb blockers past they worked , this one didn't . it even stated " maximum strength , " i still can't figure out . maximum strength what ? very confusing ! not only , but most gel capsules broken open leaked out bottle making it mess waste , you could not use them . i think i stick my trusted carb blockers they worked non-messy more cost effective . least there wasn't any waste involved such these . i would not purchase again	-1
this product worked surprisingly well my feet , which get really dried out our tough midwest winters . i've seen noticeable difference my skin during first week use . i particularly liked fact this product fragrance free not greasy . my only complaint i expecting this product thick cream , but it really just lotion . most lotions aren't rich enough my tough feet , but this one seems trick	-1

i oily scalp but lots dandruff . nizoral really removes dandruff without drying scalp or hair . smell relatively pleasant ( scent little bit medicinal side , but it not offensive all ) . it stops itch almost instantly , when used regularly , it keeps off dandruff . despite high price , it definitely worth purchase . i tried many other anti-itch dandruff shampoo , but they either dry scalp too much ( e.g. head shoulders ) , or they smell offensive ( coal tar products ) . smell coal tar products remind me flea shampoo i used wash my dog ! all all , i would given nizoral 10 stars if i could . i would highly recommend this product .	1
i used this product couple times now , i really like it controlling dandruff . i noticed marked decrease flaking itching , my hair lot softer too ! only negative point i could find price . it well worth it , but little pricey . i would definitely recommend this product my friends family	-1

calvin klein escape women bit more " perfume-y " than what i usually wear , but i like it occasional alternative fragance . it powerful scent whose richness gives it almost masculine quality , yet it not all musky . rather , it slight woodsy note me , i find it more fruity than floral . fairly strong scent , it also very good staying power . finally , i don't find this fragrance particularly sensual or sexy , so it works well business wear , although it not something i would wear every day . overall , likeable scent i would rate 3.5 -4 stars	-1
i very pleased this hair dryer . previously , i always purchased " conair " type dryer under [ ... ] lasted two three years . i decided upgrade this time . i very fine hair , but lot it , so my hair tends look frizzy untamed . this dryer wonderful . my hair dries just fast before , but now it smoother stays more uniform . dryer not too loud either i don't think its heavy	-1
i've this hairdryer 6 months , it really works well . i wavy , thick hair this thing really dries it fast . i particularly like airflow concentrator nozzle it - that great option styles which need straighter , smoother hair . only odd thing it where power switch placed - it right under your fingers , i find i occasionally end up shutting it off accidentally . but even price - which little high - this great hair dryer . it gets very hot if you want it , so make sure you keep finger near cool air button	-1
i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	-1
whenever i am out i my glasses around my neck . funny thing when i go put them i pull them apart . this makes everyone jump ! thinking i just broke my glasses lol too funny . then when they see how they work they all want pair . i know i could spokes person this company . excellent product very well made i mine years no complaints ever	1

this powder it all . taste great because you add banana make it banana shake or peanut butter or chocolate syrup etc . you mix it juice or milk both ways grea t.t rick your kids add it ice cream shake . amount good vitamins minerals this more then anything else i come across . i fan this shake over 10 years now my son loves it too . when i pregnant could not keep any food down this shake kept me happy healthy . a+++	1
i love this drink . it bit acquired taste -- i found it little bit chalky , but i love it now . it full essential nutrients , so it completely worth cost . chocolate flavor far best my humble opinion . i usually combine cup ( it comes its own measuring cup ) cup skim milk blend it . mixing it together without blender causes it clump something awful , so blender definitely essential . i recommend pouring how much milk you intend drink your designated drinking vessel first before you blend ; shake tendency froth this way you don't end up excess sitting blender . generally i've found days i time drink this shake ( washing blender morning prove bit much ) i more energy just feel ... healthier . you really can't go wrong this drink . i found drinking this meal replacement aid very helpful weight loss	1

solid construction . elegant design which would lot better if name " verilux " not front . type doesn't scream out you but still , i don't pay this much money look ads . bought two lamps . one each side easel makes my mistakes pop out across room . lamps arrrived few hours ago i could see second i turned them i save lot time frustration while painting ( note : brought two only because sale . one would adequate ) reading , i'm not so sure lamp . traveling -- definately . far better light than class motels i stay afford . it portable it says . very slick how it folds up . home , i'm accustomed bright but soft yellow light . verilux light probably better eyes . matter taste i suppose . don't think it would take long become accustomed verilux reading . probably harder go it incandescent . price , verilux should use better " removable " adhesive labels front top . or not put labels all . took some effort remove gunk . best way take label dab it back repeatedly gooey areas . don't bother soap water . doesn't work ( i knew it wouldn't when i tried but all i ) .	-1

i don't normally bother writing reviews unless i really love something or really hate it . mistique air therapy fountain mister exceeded my expectations . i'm astonished negative review below only wonder if reviewer i talking same item . so glad i didn't let him/her put me off buying one these . what good this fountain : mister came mostly assembled , so assembly part no problem ; i afraid changing colours going look bit cheesy , but fact they quite beautiful watch ; i mist adjuster set high ( it sort-of flap , i it pushed all way up ) experienced no puddles water ; fountain makes pleasant swirly mist , sort like dry ice ; it gives off very soft gentle-spring-rain sound ; it lot easier clean than traditional tabletop fountains ; it nice , sleek , modern design ; mister shuts off if water level goes below what recommended ; it doesn't require frequent refills - once day lasts while ; it specifically states tap water only used - no go shops distilled or other water . i haven't yet tried pearlessence oils , but i used body shop home fragrance oils they work really well . six drops directly water gives off pleasant scent within six-foot radius , but after while scent permeates lot farther . so , turn mister , put your favourite scent , pour your preferred beverage , put some soothing music , turn down lights . if this doesn't relax you , you need professional help . february 22 , 2007 : this follow-up my earlier review . i just received additional misters work gifts . they changed design , so my comments adjustable mister flap no longer valid , because it isn't there any more . it now comes small glass disk i think place keep water spraying all over . you'll still need put mister plate or tray , but it , i think , avoid possibility getting large puddles water underneath . also , inner parts now unassembled , but so simple put together , you'd completely incapable following instructions if you can't manage it . addition , if you plan give one gift , open box first - bowl one mine arrived cracked several places . i still love my mister , though	1

this clipper replaced old wahl clipper i bought 18 years ago ( started locking up ) . only problem i i run it through hair more slowly than my older one . i tried adjusting cutting plate indicated instructions , but could not make it better ( i could make it worse ) , although i may still not it quite right . if i run it through hair too quickly , it doesn't cut . if i slow down -- which force me pay attention more carefully , maybe that good -- it cuts just fine . i'm otherwise pleased it , but only it few months	-1

this device pretty good , kids loved sleeping it running . then i purchased gauss meter discovered whopping 400.0 mg emf radiating it . considering most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0 mg , anything over 10.0 mg considered extreme cancer risk this completely unacceptable . emf declined rapidly range device increases , effectively dropping 0 6 feet . however people put this their nightstand should immediately rectify situation ! fact matter , all electrical devices should always minimum 5 feet away body bedrooms . even so , i question engineering this device if it emits such drastic level emf .	-1

i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	-1

this best product dry hands . my skin always becomes so dry ( chicago winters you ) , especially my hands because i wash them often . i've using neutrogena norweigan formula hand creme some time now , but switched over eucerin once i tried it . texture far superior - silky , light , not greasy all , but still strong enough really repair dry skin . it leaves your hands feeling amazingly soft , i noticed huge difference first time i used it . 2.7 ounce tubes great because it small enough fit into purse without cumbersome , but you don't need much per application , so it lasts while . this product actually very similar l'ocitanne hand lotion , which very devoted following . but if you don't feel like spending $20 2 ounces , i highly recommend eucerin , which cheaper alternative comparable quality	1

first all , like previous user said , it work , but it side effects . i experienced first hand if you don't take it while , you start back taking it , you get dizzy queasy . it also makes you feel way if you don't eat properly , just take capsule . you definitely eat first , then take it . said , i love taking it . don't get me wrong , i don't abuse these pills because you shouldn't any pills diet or otherwise . you also can't expect pill all work either . i needed something would help enhance my cardio workouts . when i take these pills , it helps boost my energy ( caffeine ) it helps me burn fat . result , helps keep my body fat percentage down . anything , it definitely not everybody , but i taken everything " applecider vinegar " tablets " green tea " tablets , neither one worked like this one . i say this proudly now , but i used weigh more than 300 pounds . i since then come long way , this pill , lot cardio combined weightlifting	-1

this laundry detergent cleans well , economical ( especially larger sizes , course ) , relatively " environmentally friendly ( see below some questions this ) . " 7th generation cleans using enzymes vegetable-based ingredients instead harsher chemicals . moreover , it non-toxic completely biodegradable . while it relatively easy ( least , some areas ) these days find other detergents no phosphates , concentrated , no dyes or fragrances ( although it little harder find product without any these ) , this product also contains no optical brighteners , not tested animals . ok , why brag your product no optical brighteners ? well , these colorless , fluorescent chemicals biodegrade slowly . some optical brighteners dangerous fish other water-dwellers , some produce eye skin irritation ( although i wouldn't rub 7th generation my eyes either ) . here full ingredient list product ( available seventhgeneration.com, but edited me ): ingredients : coconut-based surfactants , non-animal derived enzymes , natural water softener alkalinity builder ( borax ) , agent wash away soils ( sodium gluconate ) , viscosity control agent ( table salt ) , natural fragrance ( citrus oil ) , preservative ( less than 0.05% ) , water . perhaps ironically , i'm going lower my rating little because 7th generation full disclosure policy . borax table salt generally mined ( company doesn't mention how they obtain these chemicals -- they should ) , fragrance-free detergent contains fragrance ( ! ) -- citrus oil -- albeit natural one . if they're going make " no fragrances " or " masking agents " selling point , then addition any " fragrance " seems strange , given company disclosure commitment	-1
i've always liked seventh generation products , but closest store sells them hour away me . so i very happy see some seventh generation products available amazon.com . i've looked into ordering this detergent online other places , haven't found price better than this anywhere--it even better if you super-saver shipping ! ordered case it arrived great shape . i'm very pleased order this again	1

i've tried dozens different lip balm products over last 20 years . i first tried neutrogena solution 10 years ago . two things i despise lip balm : waxy feeling horrible taste/aftertaste . many competitor products one or both those failings , especially ones labelled " medicated " . if you use balm regular basis , you don't want know it there , it should just work ; highest compliment i pay neutrogena product . only downside product its relatively high price compared competition . this case , old adage " you get what you pay " quite true	1

i read all reviews before i bought this shaver . there couple who didn't like shaver . i agree them . i think electric shavers should quiet , shave close , shave fast , shave without irritation , some degree quality . close shave one you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against direction beard growth . this shaver not shave close . after several weeks shaving it still burns putting after-shave . it takes too much time shave . it fairly quiet . battery longevity average . construction quality average price range . it rated 2 stars overall . i not replace cutting head when it wears out but discard shaver .	-1
this first time i ever posted comment product , but i am so enthusiastic this shaver i feel i must share my experience . first use this product , i felt if i come out dark ages shaving . my most hated daily routine become joy ! i migrated blades foil shaving 5 years ago , thought remarkable achievement , addition conserving blood possibly saving my life . although last consumer reports test showed there virtually no difference foil rotary shaving , i got bug when local store put all their rotary shavers sale . they assured me i could return any shaver any reason , so i nothing lose . after reviewing online comments , wanting cord/cordless , i narrowed my search down norelco 7885xl remington r-960 , which quite bit less expensive than norelco . i brought them home , waited 2 days growth beard , performed " face-off . " ( pardon pun ) i shaved one side my face noreleo other remington . i felt my face noticed no big difference . but later , i noticed norelco side felt slightly irritated . i warned there might transition period foil rotary , so this didn't concern me . but , i never get irritated remington side . next day i felt my face could clearly tell growth remington side less than norelco side . my conclusion i got closer shave no irritation remington -- far less money ! my lifelong belief price not necessarily equal excellence product again reinforced . after first few days i went back got r-960 travel , i happily shaving first time my life because this great shaver . r-960 appears me better built , certainly more stylish , comes sturdy , high quality case . it good grip requires absolutely no pressure my face order get close shave . no more stray hairs my girlfriend usually discovers after it too late remove them . i never my life believed i would look forward shaving -- but now i'm shave heaven	1

i like this scale . it take some getting used exactly where position your body get accurate weight but once you figure it out it great . i love it tracks my weight loss , it validating ( long weight going down ) it great new years resolution scale	1
i bought this scale because i embarking new fitness plan . after losing 40lbs getting shape , i wanted become stronger , add muscle , while not gaining fat i worked so hard lose . i bought this scale monitor different fitness programs , key i could now distinguish gains fat gains lean mass -- muscle . almost i year i exercised least 5 times week , much it weightlifting , but also running , swimming , soccer many other activities . during time i kept track everything i ate . sometimes i would keep positive energy balance , gain muscle while not gaining or minimizing fat , other times i would negative energy balance lose fat while not losing or minimizing muscle gain . nutrition portion my plan i got excellent book power eating susan . kleiner . it roughly year , i feel great . when i play soccer i feel swift bird strong snake . i lift considerably more weight then year go . when i look mirror , i not only look bigger , but more defined . i believe i gained considerable amount muscle , perhaps 5 pounds , lost equal amount fat . i say i believe because according scale i am exactly where i year ago . when i gaining weight , scale always said it roughly 50/50 , when i lost weight it roughly same . i feeling pretty defeated until i stumbled across some photos my self year ago . difference striking obvious . i only conclude scale consistently overestimated fat gain , underestimated muscle gain . i know scale accurately measures my weight because i checked it against other scales . however , terms measuring changes body composition , reason i bought scale , it total failure . i defense weight watchers , they didn't design scale this kind use mind . but it seems me people just trying lose weight served normal scale while those targeting fat but not muscle , would given bad information this scale . i am now looking new scale , one claims monitor changes muscle mass , but i much more skeptical my next scale . i would very interested other people experiences , since i am now position not able assess fitness program i spent great deal effort . if you any advice or similar experience please email me suprruby@sbcglobal.ne	-1

my late twenties , i tried just every moisturizer i could find including rarified ingredient boutique lotions but my skin remained dry , hot , itchy , flaky , i seeing laugh lines around my eyes . i give up hope until my mother , who likes shop dollar stores , came visit bought me this full $20 price . i using oil olay total effects ever since . i am hesitant even try regenerist because i like this so well . occasions i try other lotions , they never measure up . my skin thanked me after first application . after few days , it looked better , less red , less chapped . within month or two ( or less , i don't remember after 7 years ) i no lines near my eyes , my skin feels soft comfortable unless i abuse it . when i abuse it , this lotion makes it feel better . people consistently guess my age 5-8 years younger than i am even though i grey hair . while they swear it not because immaturity , it either or ooo t.e. lotion . i almost never need more than tiny amount size pencil eraser cover my face , neck hands . ( keep cap or it dries out . ) i use this uv version morning non-uv version night . i recommend it anyone looking facial moisturizer works good or better than advertised . absolutely worth money	1
this heating pad worked great me 2 months i've it . i achy back i lie pad help me go sleep night . ( yes , i know you're not supposed ! ) medium setting perfect -- hot enough work my back but not so hot it dangerous sleep . auto-shutoff works fine it would hard accidentally change settings control . i haven't tried moist heat . if you want flexible pad wrap around your arm or leg , this would not one buy pad fairly stiff . this works my advantage , previous soft pad i used would wrinkle bunch up . what i use it , this pad perfect	1
i bought few boxes these odwalla bars january 2007 approximately = = = $22.00 /box = = = during amazon special $10 off promotion . price two boxes these bars came out $35.00 after discount . price one these bars retail stores almost -never- dips below $1.50 bar . so 48 bars , you'd paying $72.00 plus tax . you see , if you know you like these bars plan eat lot them , now time stock up . especially free shipping . product , bars themselves excellent . i eat these daily work where i'm too busy make myself breakfast , i find it takes edge off perfectly until i'm ready lunch . i'm especially fan berriesgomega choc . chip peanut flavors . they both delicious flavor , good texture , much healthier ( not mention mostly organic ) than many other so called " health " bars out there ( hooah ! etc ) , taste far better than anything else i've tried . bonus , these bars shipped out quickly ; i received them within 5 business days my order . 5 stars	1
hahaha , sorry length my very first amazon review . i'm sure i'll become faster more efficient i go . i've cleancut/femini combo couple months now except i shavey femini trimmer isn't t-bar . i find it great managing angles , shapes , tight spaces ( i've heard t-bar motor little stronger if you prefer ) . i applied some baby powder several minutes , it got hair down good stubble i shaped nice neat inverted triangle like i wanted . i'd holding out doing anything until set arrived so naturally , it took longer because i lot work . coarse hair wasn't problem little teeth though i didn't get nicked , even while getting pesky hair inner areas . i'd still say careful around those parts though . cleancut fit my curves nicely thanks its smaller size finishing job easy . cut closer , you should run opposite directional growth pull skin taught you go . it isn't close razor but i don't get any itchiness or rashes far less ingrowns which usually big problem me otherwise . i consider more than fair trade-off . just make sure you're clean , dry , powdered best results substancially lessened chance possible bite or irritation ... which you should probably most dry shavers anyway . i've tested it small area without dry lubricant it cause irritation so sure always use something . baby powder cheap there different kinds talc cornstarch based ; regular , scented , medicated ... i mention it cheap ?! can't go wrong couple bucks big bottle it . :p note , it true battery makes up most unit weight . but makes no difference me because it cuts through my coarse stubble no problem or lag spinning . it isn't loud but it make audible high humming noise . noise wasn't enough bother me i consider myself pretty uptight those things . you use them your facial hair too if wet shaving gives you ingrowns you hate waxing ... just uh , wash or wipe off foil if you use it your privates first , lol . sometimes i even use it under my arms . like most advertised things , it not miraculous amazing ads claim but you should already know not ride entirely them . said , i not disappointed it i hope someday they make wet/dry version so i don't worry getting it wet . i've used it regularly since i got it there no razors down there anymore	-1
i love this cleanser ! i use it all time , it seems work really well me . it really keep oil off my face my acne down managable level ! it only face wash i use regular basis , it doesn't burn my face or leave my skin dried out . plus side it " foam " cleanser , so it doesn't " dig " into your face or hurt when you wash it paces you acne . - it also doesn't nasty smell . i really like it lot . my opinion it worth $ , so try it ! if you've tried almost everything else ( like i , ) what you lose really ? - i'm glad i tried it , because it best daily cleanser i've found yet ! - i've using this product quite while now , i just finally decided write review . i've always got good results , so try it , you'll glad you	1

i really like this night guard . ones i gotten dentist thick bulky . when i would wear them i could not sleep because they uncomfortable . but this night guard very flexible comfortable i am no trouble sleeping it my mouth . it forces me sleep my teeth apart . if you very active your sleep ( move around alot ) or if your tongue pushes alot your teeth i could see it could hard keep this your mouth all night it not very restrictive . but exactly what i like it it stays my mouth all night . i would highly recommend this product if typical night guards not worked you	1
great help much more comfortable than standard-profile size . reviewer reported problem keeping this nightguard place . this user likely average or large mouth ; product clearly designed small mouths . it stay place just fine when properly adjusted small mouth - there no place it slip .	1

my son nursery sports theme so i grab anything i find that sports related ... second i saw this i knew i get it his room . it simply adorable , i it out his dresser looks like piece decor . humidifier quiet mist like vaporizer ... i haven't chance use it much yet but look forward it . it bit pricey , i paid $35 target . it doesn't seem built out very sturdy plastic , basketball tank doesn't lock into base , so i'd keep it away kiddos ( case they try play it break it ) .	-1
i think gillette fusion best disposable shaver market today . all my friends family complimented me how good my face looks . i highly recommend this product	-1
this makes my skin silky smooth . i'm 34 . i've given this gift my sister my mother . my mother 58 , multi-pack per day smoker(so you imagine shape her skin ) . she simply amazed how soft this makes her skin feel . addition this product , i would highly recommend microderm abrasion olay regenerist . two products together make you feel if you've spent day spa , pennies dollar !	1
i hate greasy moisturizers cannot said this product . i only used trial size so didn't see lasting effects but i loved feeling it left behind after applying .	1
this cane compact , fitting nicely into carryon . it also easy adjust ease-of-use factor . i only wish it came some upbeat , crazy colors	-1
i light acne scarring usually takes quite some time fade , especially my cheeks . so far , i've noticed these scars clearing up little faster , due peel removing topmost layer dead cells , allowing skin underneath breathe heal . i've also noticed smaller breakout area week before menstruation , which something blessing . my only disappointment due price , customers can't get small trial size try it patch skin before using it . even at-home glycolic peels should tested small , easily covered part skin before using it your entire face . some people terrible reaction . use caution before doing full treatmen t.t here some notable flushing skin , somewhat like increased skin bloodflow comes taking wrong kind niacin tablet . you should tingling sensation , not burning sensation . if it any way painful , remove it immediately . it definitely not good idea use this any facial cleanser contains menthol ( check your labels - menthol bad ingredient facial cleansers anyway ) , it not let your skin cool after using , burn	1
i love these baby-safe disposable diapers . i use kissaluvs cloth diapers during day my little girl , but use tushies night when we're run or traveling . absorbancy great night -- better than kissaluvs booster doubler . they keep moisture away her skin -- safely since there no gel used these diapers ( fyi , gels used other diapers never proven safe federal government not regulate materials/chemicals used baby diapers -- which means manufacturers not required law disclose materials/chemicals used diapers . kinda makes you wonder why infertility rates rise ! hmmm . ) . sometimes we poop blowouts when we're run since barrier cuff leg latex-free ( which good thing , though -- makes diaper more baby-safe ) , so i just use bummies super whisper wrap diaper cover over tushies diaper -- just case . these diapers come highly recommended if you care what you put against your baby skin . i can't protect her all bad stuff , but this just one small thing i home reduce her exposure nasty chemicals materials	1
these diapers fantastic ! i myself prefer cloth diapers , but because we high water table if we much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck ! i am also severely chemically sensitive so scent " normal " diapers even seventh generations ones gel make me ill . but these great !! they made wood pulp/paper feel if there cotton them . they no chemical scent all feel nice soft smooth my fingers . they close means adhesive strip either side closes onto larger piece thin plastic either side . if you accidentally close adhesive strip paper it tear when you pull it back off usually not reseal . this not problem if you use them only once . we potty our baby so sometimes we take it off put it back few times before it gets wet or dirty . other than accidentally sticking strips paper i haven't problem using them like this . there elastic legs but it basically encased so it isn't contact skin they snug enough my baby legs . these little harder tell if they wet than seventh generation ones ( i've never used regular diapers since i can't get near them their chemical scent ) because there isn't gel . i usually just put finger it then touch finger my thumb then i tell if i feel dampness or not . if my baby pees lot though it easy tell if it wet ... even outside because it look little more molded form , but not feel damp outside inside less damp even then than cloth diaper . packaging says you should not let baby put these his/her mouth since it paper tear off their mouth it should not held near flame - again because it made out paper . but all said , these not flimsy all , they well made hold up just well regular disposable . i highly recommend these anyone who whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or those times when impractical ( day care ) those people who want limit their baby exposures chemicals	1
i expecting excellent product norelco when i purchased this replace my worn out conair trimmer . it turns out quality just fair . it works ok trimming facial hair though not perfectly . i strongly suggest not using this trimming body hair because it very easy clip your skin . no matter how careful i am i can't avoid drawing blood . i defiantly replacing this set something better very soon .	-1
i bought this while back began finding problems it right away . 1 ) trimmer cannot operate a/c power alone . this means you can't plug it into wall use it . instead , you charge battery , then unplug it use it . 2 ) 2 weeks after i bought it , beard trimmer attachment broke . little tabs hold it different lengths snapped off so you only use it shortest setting , you hold attachment your hand so it won't slide off . clearly , i'm not only one who this happened . 3 ) nose trimmer very dull blades . i don't normally use nose trimmer nor i really need one , but i cheap one i got my christmas stocking i've used few times . out curiosity , i tried attachment came this trimmer introduced new kind pain . it pulling hairs but not cutting them . i contacted representative norelco see if i they would send me replacement beard attachment or if i could purchase just attachment . they directed me their service centers who wanted $10 just attachment . including shipping , it would cost me almost what i payed whole set . my advice : pay little more something sturdier . that what i plan doing	-1
this my favorite zia product , favorite overall skin care product . i've used it years , haven't found moisturizer , exfoliator or skin conditioner works good this one . i use it night directed , whenever my skin sunburned , wind burned or otherwise distressed . if you happen use zia products love wonderfully delicious scent their ultimate line products , you may disappointed : this one mostly scentless . however , this may plus many people	1

i looked few different sun lamps amazon ended up this one because price discounted . company website not many detailed specs i wanted see before buying product , so i called customer service . receive 10,000 lux , you sit least close 15 inches . manual says ionizer , you sit far 20 inches ( i'm not sure i believe - i think it just recommended " treatment session " , not 10,000 lux ) . also , lights should good 3 years ( there 4 lamp ) , it currently $60 replace all 4 . ionizer , i wasn't looking anything like this feature , i skeptical it first . however , i since learned it great plus light itself ; it like fresh air blowing you . ionizer lamp , i almost feel like i'm sitting outside sunny day . shipping prompt , customer service ok ( they take day call me back even during business hours- but they nice answered all my questions ) , i'm very happy lamp . i'm not morning person , but i find myself actually looking forward going work morning just so i sit next lamp . i wasn't convinced when i bought lamp light therapy would actually counter my winter depression , but i'm believer now . this lamp certainly worked well me .	1

any item neck/head rest should atleast meet your neck or head . this backrest might fit child up 13 y.o. it . it well made but identical others found here $50 . only differences 1 ) cup holder opposite side , 2 ) came power pack run massage unit instead eating battteries , 3 ) reading ligh t.t he power pack smart idea , however massage only lower back it isn't very powerful . let alone it doesn't make good contact your back . i would prefered it more shoulders . light ... well , it pretty worthless led light runs off 4 d-size batteries use run massage unit less expensive models . i guess sharper image find purpose useless battery holder justify getting 3x price this item . my opinion sharper image they charge outrageous price get you think it superior product . it all mail-order catalog junk you could find fraction cost elsewhere . this product identical ( i think it ) homedics one you get walmart $49 , or here amazon , you get choice colors	-1
i've eying foot spa while got one christmas . it gift i most excited , so i tried it out right away . i honest when i say i expected bit more , but it still felt nice . max fill line seems bit lower than i would anticipate , so i filled it little more . i turned it found out it little noisy ... but then you turn heat it very loud . seriously , you won't want heat going entire time .... it just too overpowering ! however , after 20 minutes , my feet feel great quite relaxed . you get what you pay	-1
since moving virginia , i spend least month every spring feeling like i'm waking up bad cold . i promised myself this year , i would try good-quality air purifier . i debated among sharp fp-n60cx plasma cluster air purifier , mitsubishi plasmapure quiet hepa air purifier , this one . end , they all high ratings , i am sure they'd all worked well , but i liked looks this one . turns out , it looks even cooler person . more importantly , i wake up feeling great . also , it inaudible night setting which important since it my bedroom . smell sensor really works - drop new pile laundry near it it go off because dryer sheet smell . my room just so much nicer now although it can't follow me around take care my allergies rest day , it let me get good night sleep , which all i could ask . get into technical side it , there two sensors - one pollen/dust one smells . there indicators front which show mode unit ( such turbo , pollen , night ) well levels indicators smell one side pollen other . i also need mention distributor , sparo , wonderful . i asked them email before my order shipped send silver instead white . they responded quickly no problem . then i let them know two buttons my remote didn't work , they responded immediately they overnighting new one , which they . couldn't happier them or product ! you can't go wrong this	1
after reading other very positive reviews amazon , i bought two these right out gate i'm not regretting it all . i actually bought 780 sq ft . versions . they work great helped reduce my sneezing , etc due sensitity cat dander we two cats . i love automatic feature where it detects impurities odors kicks into gear filter it out . i also like mode allergy season where it alternates medium low filter out allergens air . air our house much more ' fresh ' since we got them . visitors commented how ' clean ' air smells . i bought one each floor our house . i like how light portable they so you move them room room if you'd like . if i am going work my home office , i'll move it bedroom my office put it back bedroom night . lowest fan setting almost inaudible . very quiet . even medium setting not overly loud doesn't bother me when i'm sleeping . i like how you it run certain mode 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 hours but then it shuts off . i'd like it if it just went back auto after timer up , but that minor design flaw my opinion . overall , very pleased purchase . old adage true ; you get what you pay	1

really works pretty well . very quiet , increase humidity room very fast . i fill tank every other day . i put it my desk ( 1m high ) not see it wetted carpet . only thing if you see white dust around , you should buy purified water use it , but it not drawback this product , it common problem any ultrasonic humidifier , which you use if you don't want noisy coolmist	1
very very appropriate home or business use . shaves hair smoothly ....... 5 stars product !!!!	1
i love this bumble bumble conditioner . it smells fantastic ! if you don't like smell coconut however don't use this product . it beachy smell . it heavy moisturizing conditioner , so don't use too much or it could weigh your hair down . i very thick straight highlighted hair feel this conditioner leaves it silky smooth color undamaged . i tried lot different hair products this one far my favorite	1

i heard all hype surrounding remington their shaving products but i always stayed away because price . this case i made gamble , satisfied price , i decided test it . hype associated this brand well worth it , they clearly know how make electric shaver . it contours my face gives me " closest " shave i ever . it takes little time get used closeness but your face certainly feels looks different . you spend little more $ get more sophisticated model but this model works fine me . stick this brand there nothing like it	-1
well , i must agree those who said this shaver mediocre . i bought refurbished one $20 it worth , but not penny more . it not give close shave without going over your face several times . my norelco worked this well when blades 8 years old ! i admit , i usually shave twice norelco , but remington not nearly good . get decent shave , i press pretty hard go over each area several times . i end up bit redness pressing i get shaver work reasonably well . if you're buying shaver $40 , save your money find norelco that sale	-1
i both very dry very easily sunburned skin , so moisturizing sunscreen must . i've using this eucerin lotion years now . perhaps my skin bit sensitive , but whenever i've tried switch something less expensive or easier find , i've adverse reactions . now eucerin only thing i use my face	1
i purchased these because i wanted some curl my very straight , fine hair . packaging very compact very portable . metal pins held even my fine hair place . they not get " hot " 90 seconds advertised ( more like 4-5 min ) get more than just " warm " , lid sealed . amount curlers just right my shoulder length hair , however red rods too big just produced " body " not so much curls . i would think if you longer hair or just wanted body this would 5++ . i bought them " red " super department store just 12.99 ! overall , i would recommend they nice - just didnt suit my needs	-1
i used many facial products including very pricey products this one my favorites . it makes my skin feel soft luxurious whereas other products i've used either made my skin feel dry or no difference . i also noticed after using this full month age spot i under my eye almost completely faded	1

not even worth 1 star but 0 not option ; i used rope only 5 times before it shredded pieces broke . it worse product i've ever used . bally must already know defect this product but yet still selling it ; i work out often ropes before but none this poor quality . my last rope cheap nylon rope which i forgot my hotel room while traveling it much better quality because i it over 3 years it never gave me any trouble i used it faithfully everyday . first all , this bally rope would not stay doorknob so i tied it tight so it would'nt come off .. then while using it it start smelling if it burning pieces shreds black rope start falling my face . then pulley start hanging out after only week using it .. rope shredded broke off pully all together .. so there u it .. u curious buy it see yourself but i ignore bad review before i ordered it also .. thinking it can't bad .. ;)) .. but it worse than review bally lose major points me ... i would'nt even work out their gym because they intentionally cheated people out money because i'm sure they test products before selling them they know this bad product . well okay there u it .. if u don't believe my review .. order see yourself .	-1

i replaced norelco rotary shaver braun . i liked idea shaver cleaned , sanitized charged after each shave so i bought braun . so far , it shaves much closer than my norelco . shaver not quite " mobile " norelco due its shape it noisier than my norelco , but it comfortable my face good job . cleaning system works well but also noisy 5 minutes . you replace cleaning fluid cartridge after every so many cleanings , but doesn't entail lot money . all all , i like shaver would buy it again . i use pre-shaving fluid my face it seems help closeness shave	-1

although rather small using rechargeable battery , i using this trimmer trim all body hair , including my scalp , which main reason i purchased it . it somewhat small trimmer " head " virtue rechargeable it necessary user make more than one pass over scalp , but if you want cut your hair close blade , this unit it just fine .... other hand , because it so small lightweight , it extremely easy non-tiring use . motor noise certainly lot less than my older , standard hair trimmer , which makes terribly loud noise . so far , i would recommend this trimmer anyone who looking one use all over body , including scalp .	-1
i am one those individuals who cannot wear any scent i may drawn because most give me headaches . few i wear this one my favorite ! it light subtle , not powdery , not overbearing so someone needs right next you beaware your fragrance . there nothing worse , my opinion , than overwhelmed someone else scent . i even wear this when i'm staying-in because i enjoy fragrance much . my only criticism reason 4* vs . 5 , scent not stick around long enough . i find myself reapplying once ( least ) day . they need body oil or lotion . i haven't tried gel yet but maybe layering it would help it last .	-1
never thought see it . this razor shaves close blade . fast , light , comfortable hand .	1
i've using this few days , i've used it both dry light lather shaving cream . color me impressed ! this thing shaves least close my blades ( gillette sensor excell ) , more consistent results less chance cuts . it very comfortable use , my skin better shape after shaving than when i use manual blade . i actually lightly scrape myself lightly it my adam apple first use due using too much pressure raised area , so it definitely getting close it requires bit technique . but easily mastered , i've no problems since then . they say give it 30 days your face beard acclimate new shaver , but i don't think that going necessary . i don't foresee regularly using manual blade anymore . i'm getting better results less time more convenience than i got blades . i've zero issues clean up . i just put it under running water motor running it gets clean . it special 17000rpm cleaning mode ( " turbo " - what doesn't use moniker these days ? ) make sure it gets clean . you use bit hand soap ( per instructions ) cleaning foils it lather out , then you rinse it off , it like new again . i can't imagine needing cleaning station comes other packages this same razor . this great electric razor - recommended .	1

this item great . careful if you sweaty though	1
i wasn't going try this first because i thought it might " weak " because packaging looks really pretty delicate - more like face cream than sunblock . i only tried it because i received " buy one get one free " coupon - i pleasently surprised ! this only sunblock i use now . it isn't greasy , dries quickly , relatively water/sweat resistant , really blocks sun . i used it when i went kayaking it saved me painful burn . areas i didn't apply sunblock carefully burnt peeling . neat part you see my fingermarks areas i carelessly slapped some sunblock proves how well this product work ( if used properly )	1

i used tell everyone what great trimmer this ! i took very good care it probably used it my face or eyebrows only two or three times month . then ten months after receiving it , plastic head portion holds blade fell off not reattach . i guess if i want continue using this trimmer , i figure out way tape or glue head back unit . it comes one year warranty , but because i received it gift , i not receipt . i contacted emjoi they refused replace it , even though i used it less than year . i asked if they would repair it my expense told they not repairs , only replacements . so , here expensive little gadget company not worry keeping its customers satisfied . obviously i no longer recommend this emjoi product anyone . save yourself lot money buy $10 version discount/drug stores . then , if when it breaks , you won't feel so badly throwing it away	-1

i bought two these brushes . i love way they work , but they break too quickly . neither one them lasted longer than three months ( package says replace heads every three four months ... think it ) first one great while , but water got into battery compartment caused batteries leak . i blamed it myself went out buy new one . i extra careful not get bottom wet , which interesting considering it product made used around water . not disgusting , but how you rinse off your saliva without getting it wet ??? this second one lasted little bit longer than first one , but now i interesting problem where i cannot get battery compartment fit back inside brush ! even batteries not inside it , compartment not snap all way . if it not closed , it won't run , water would able get inside anyway . following points consider , their own they would not bother me but i'll mention them anyway : -the battery compartment , when working , little difficult get open . -on first brush i no problem getting power switch slide up wet hands , but second brush switch went considerably harder i need put my hand inside towel turn brush . -as far it whitening properties , i don't know if it , i've never paid attention . it keep my teeth clean though . other hand , my boyfriend bought his same time i bought my first one , his still going strong . he doesn't treat his any special way , so it looks like it just roll dice whether or not you get good brush . i'm not taking chance any more , next brush different brand . i'd rather buy more expensive brush lasts long time than cheap one i replace every 3 months .	-1

i'm more than satisfied this scale . i concerned i would buy more expensive scale get good accuracy ( see reviews other digital scales this price range , ) but i've tested it several times over several days , my weight varies 2 pounds or less over course day . my first weigh-in day pretty much same previous mornings , sadly . neutral color ( grey ) glass would blend well just any decor , lcd screen easy read , 1.5 inch high numbers . only thing i don't like it it creaks quite lot when i step it , even though i'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . problem my head more than scale : i don't think it going break , but it sounds like i've got two people standing it once--i'm not fat , am i ? added feature when i'm craving , i go into bathroom look it , know it isn't going fall any my excuses tomorrow morning . so last piece cake still sits fridge . scale intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy read , easy eyes , intimidating -- i think it good deal	-1
i bought this after using inexpensive wahls years . i love it several reasons : 1 ) it cuts without pulling your whiskers2 ) it very precise3 ) it picks up 90% or more your whiskers4 ) not only you not hair sink , but you no longer feel like it take shower get all excess hair out your beard , if there any speak of5 ) unlike others , i not feel need more precision tool trim my mustache . it worked just fin	1
everything advertized . love turbo feature speeds up heating process less than one minute	1
over years , i tried many different brands types heated rollers i never liked using any them . i recently bought new set which i return due fact i terrible time trying roll my hair almost smooth surface rollers then after clipping rolls , they would immediately fall out my hair .... scream ! i bought remmington #1080n wax core roller set i finally found easiest quickest way curl my hair . rollers surface , when warm , grab hair ends immediately allow great control when trying roll even short hair . rollers held place full clip which looks more like comb so clips not leave ridge my hair . once heated , rollers relatively cool touch ( no more burned fingers ) but due wax core , rollers hold plenty heat it takes just few minutes after setting produce excellent , long lasting results . set takes 10 - 15 minutes warm up . i've found warm up time takes longer than time i actually leave curlers my hair . this best curler set i ever used . if i ask one change , it would quicker warm up time . however , just fact rolling so quick easy , makes up few extra minutes preparation . i'm hard please , so my recommendation says alot . thanks remmington ( i still don't like your other regular rollers ! ha )	1

scale indeed looks very nice sleek its glass design . quality seems quite nice , it designed england . there 10 year warranty case anything goes wrong . scale very accurate , but i agree others tapping issue . i more like " hit " it my foot get it started . make sure you wait until 18888 turns 0 before stepping . 18888 means it calibrating scale 0 . you keep very still weight stabilize . or else it just keep going up down , although you'll able get your weight within half pound before number stabilizes	-1

i drink lot bottled water . it not make me feel full - sometimes quite opposite . course , drinking water before or during meal lessens chance overeating , but effect skinny water goes beyond . i love its taste because it not overbearing too sweet like other citrus-flavored water i've tried . it replaces my soda curbes my apetite pretty well . i also bought bottle friend mine . he wondering why he wasn't getting hungry long time , only later realized it must skinny water . it costs quite bit . however , bunch drinks cost same negative impact your body . so , even if this placebo effect ( , fankly , i don't care long it works ) , i think it worth it . you'll judge yourself . i can't afford three bottles day , but buy this water sporadically , most likely my local 7-11 . i would like point out most people who wrote negative reviews here either didn't like taste water , or never tasted it first place . course some people don't like taste - you can't please everybody - but it bears no relevance its efectiveness ! people who review stuff without trying it ... well ... they obviously don't understand what review means , too bad their preconceptions count towards overall score product	1
i little skeptical when i first bought bodygroom , but i say it definitely worth money . first time i used it , it extremely comfortable easy , areas i shaved ended up almost smooth if i used razor . it easy clean recharges quickly . only drawback it doesn't work well after you've used it while . i'm not sure if it because blades dull quickly or if it just normal wear tear , but you just little more careful because it easier nick yourself when it worn little . overall , however , bodygroom great tool trimming keeping groin , chest , underarm areas smooth	-1

yes scott most popular bathroom tissue since time began -- but " bounty " bathroom tissue : but this std . form little roughthis " scott bathroom tissue " strong , very long lasting , terrific value . there , however , one rub -- it little rough this application , especially frequent usage [ which why they recently introduced " scott extra soft " product ] . " charmin ultra " would better choice if you need extra softness some store brands such kroger , shop-rite , wal-mart " great value " comparable value-specific picks . scott always considered " gold standard " bathroom , but its superiority challenged increasingly recent years . if you still like this product , there no reason change . however if your needs now require softer tissue , try " scott extra soft " or " charmin ultra " . i recently noticed other reviewers , glued end paper roll must pulled apart order start roll seems very hard detach . this seems new phenomenon leads me believe things changed scott not better . maybe it just fluke . maybe it no big deal . maybe scott bathroom tissue isn't quite good it used . maybe it rougher coarser than before . just maybe . meantime , however , i am now using " charmin ultra " after 40 years continuous scott patronage . [ i am not affiliated any product or company . ]	-1

strengths : cheap ; sleek design ; wet shave ; retains charge long timeweaknesses : not come international voltage charger ; not very good hair necklinesummary : its price its really neat thing . braun points out , shaving wet skin not give close shave because skin swells when wet . so i dont prefer wet shave . yet feature good those who suffer rash or itch dry shave . it take bit getting-used-to dry shave . normally within 2-3 weeks most people adapt it . this one like most straight-head shavers not best around neckline you may need learn few tricks ur own get close shave around area . it retains its charge upto 5/6 shaves provided you shave least once 2 days course depending rate ur beard growth . it doesnt come any fancy accessories like stand brush like braun . but hey ... u paying half price	-1
my friend mary-anne given away many these razors because she thinks they so great . i recipient one mar then i went out bought extra travel recommending it all over place . no cuts your knees , convenient storage case sealed extra blades ( no rusting while waiting ) solid grip handle so it easy hold under running water . i know people think it pricy , but it comes extra blades lasts much longer than regular disposables . give it try	1
this well-blended , complex , layered fragrance . it quite heady going , you only need use very light spritz . it lasted all day without changing character . this probably because its parfum spray , not eau de toilette . this sized bottle should last long time . perfumes very subjective , but i really liked scent . you still smell lingering fragrance your skin after shower . its definitely classic style rather than contemporary - think chanel rather than lo or brittney . overall , i think its one best new perfumes out . i bought this direct amazon - great price , buying direct amazon i know i get real thing , not knock-off . i don't same confidence other online stores , whether they sell through amazon or not . i bought some well-known online perfume stores past sent imitations or old stock - ugh . it made me very cautious where i shop . some fakes obvious but other ones very clever you only detect imitation if you already familiar product	1

i personally am connoisseur energy drinks . i rely caffeine most my projects school late night coding sessions well marathon gaming . although energy drinks considered crutch , it lifestyle decision many , many people embrace rather than attempt avoid ... i am one these people . said , guru energy fairly cheap ( $1.25 usd/can ) if you buy it here off amazon , it comes redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans , shipped suprisingly lightweight compact case ( compare this monster , rockstar , or any other brand standard 16 fl/oz cans ) . taste , like guru website describes , very indescribable . it very sharp light medium amount carbonation . caffeine buzz more " natural " ... it more upslope downslope rather than sudden cracked out ( which arguably awesome too its own respect ) then big crash sort feeling . this because caffeine guru derived 125mg guaranine ( guarana herb ) rather than synthetically separated then added . there no mention how much 125mg guaranine real caffeine , but since red bull checks 80mg / 8.3 oz it seems guru pretty good shape . i think particular good feature guru it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup . i appriciate good quality soda , particularly microbrew colas , they often exclusively contain cane sugar . so summary , this energy drink farily cheap , good buzz , all natural , great coding , gaming , or studying	1
i love it works great , one flaw .... when you change numbers leneghth you want it trim , well you like ( 1|3|4|6 ... ) so one time i left it 11 , but didnt realize i pushed it down ( top ) .... well it went 1 , i could see 1 line so i figured it fine , well guess what , i lost my beard lol ...... they could made it more user friendly , but once you screw up once you realize never it again . otherwise works great ! wish there catcher all trimmed hair :-) kosher	-1

good9170xlcc gives excellent shave 5 minutes . it'll take 2 weeks daily use your beard adjust razor heads , but after it close clean any blade shave . bad : 1 . it cheaply made . norelco outsourced manufacturing it shows . frame holding razor heads plastic ; every other norelco i've owned ( over 30 years ) metal . frame supported these weird plastic-bubble " shock absorbers " probably go year or two . shaver junky , cheap feel it . i always gotten 5-6 years use out my past norelcos ; this one feels like it'll last two years . 2 . cleaning tank marketing gimmick sell $[ ... ]/bottle cleaning solution . way overkill . it work ok , but shaver gets just clean if you rinse it under hot tap water ( which you anyway because cleaning solution leaves razor heads coated slimy residue ) . you pretty much throw it out after free bottle solution used up . 3 . i'm already my second unit . chip controls battery level indicator , recharging , etc . flakey . first one i never could accurately display battery level even after 3 complete charge-discharge-recharge cycles . it'd show 15-20 minutes remaining , then just die middle shave ; battery tapped out . also , it would sometimes illuminate no reason all ; turn on-off clear it . if it happened during night , battery would fully discharged morning . so i returned it amazon.com ( thx amazon great customer service !!! ) . second one they sent me recharges continuously when you use it cleaning tank -- it not supposed charge during 55-minute cleaning cycle , but mine . means you catch it 5 minutes into cycle , after it it dunking tank , or it'll recharge completely after every shave ( which instructions tell you not because it shortens battery life ) . more reason toss cleaning unit . ridiculous shaver this expensive they'd ship junk their customers before fixing these problems . 4 . travel case worthless protecting shaver road . it nothing but zippered nylon sack . you'll put shaver into something else if you pack it checked luggage or it'll pile parts when you unpack . 5 . they don't include stand so when you're shaving you lay it bathroom countertop . i'm using one my old norelco , but if you don't one , storage shaves just setting it down somewhere . sad see fine old company like norelco cheapening it flagship product like this . i've customer 30+ years , but next time i'm market shaver i definitely comparison-shop competition . two stars because it give good shave ; rest mess	-1

i've used schick quattro 3 years now happy it . i thought i would try out this powered m3 razor see what all hype . many my friends said they got best shave ever using it : no razor burn , bumps , or nicks etc . however , m3 gave me more razor burn nicks than any razor i've ever used ! could it i wasn't used mach 3 blades after using quattro years ? rule out blade differences , i subsequently tried power quattro obtained similar , albeit less drastic , negative results . particular , both m3 power quattro really number my neck area . i even people comment how abused my neck looked after shaving these two razors . both gillette schick assert vibrations diminish irritation lead superior shave . my case , i believe vibrations actually lead more irritation ! my personal experience these razors , my cynical nature , lead me believe vibrating razors just ploy shaving industry get people buy more product ( i.e. , aftershave creams lotions cover up mess such razors create ) . my advice avoid these powered hybrids alltogether stick regular quattro or mach 3 razor .	-1

i just looking way get rid calluses my feet , so i figured foot spa good start . i've read various reviews elsewhere foot spas , dr. scholl came up favorite , so i'd figure i'd try it . i'm not sure what people expect foot spas , but i liked this one lot . unit lot places hold it , which big deal if you want put water it move it where you get thing work . lot water very heavy , but you actually don't need much this unit . there lines interior amount , which probably few quarts mos t.t he unit plastic hood thing where touch-toe controls located . you turn it massage very nifty bubbles massager thing . interior where you place your feet all these nubby things it , where you little self-massage . there also spaces both foot recepticles where you place two different foot massage attachments . one raised cylinder spins when you rub your feet against it ; it looks like something like small hamster wheel . one , i didn't like because it so high you can't rest your feet all water . rubbing action didn't help all . there insert just nubs it , like nubs bottom foot spa . this much more comfortable , what nubs : good place rub soles your feet . i used peppermint foot bath additive okay ( this something i added ; it not included foot spa . ) additive okay , not something i'd pay again , but bad thing it it impeded my use bubble mechanism . everytime i hit , peppermint stuff foamed up ridiculously spilled out foot spa . that shame , because nicest thing this device bubble mechanism . it really pleasant sensation ( so next time , if i add anything foot bath , i'll make sure it non-foaming ! )you put hot water this . massage control also heat controller . it not , directions say , make cold water hot . it , however , keep hot water hotter longer . i used this 20 minutes first time around , very hot water i used still nicely warm when i through . cleaning this bit bear . blue shield houses control device helps keep water warm not removable . means you go slinging around inside device wash dry it . just nuisance , not enough turn me off this foot spa . cord sufficently long , it wraps around elevated feet unit storage . only other thing i'd mention when you wash it out , sure tip it almost upside down get rid water . thin blue strip runs down center each foot areas where bubbles come out ; seems hold quite bit water even after you're emptying it . just turn it over give it good shake , that'll take care it . all all , i'd recommend this . it pleasant , it works well , softened calluses easy me pumice off after 20-minute soak .	1

owned my fountain four months run it constantly since i purchased it , i not any problems it whatsoever . it clever design - three pillar candles appear " melting , " but drip water pillar pillar . flickering leds make soothing patterns walls just bright enough approximate candle-like glow . falling water sound beautiful no t-t oo-loud . i keep it nightstand next bed . still night , it might seem little loud first , but you get used it relatively quickly . when i company , they usually seem intrigued gentle flicker light against wall . i would definitely buy . pros :( 1 ) soothing . sounds looks nice . ( 2 ) acts natural humidifier . ( 3 ) avoids fire hazards while i sleep ( unlike real candle) ! caveat(s ): ( 1 ) it bit cheap . candles made plastic , base ( it seems ) all parts . ( 2 ) occasionally , pump bit loud . remedy : you may able dampen loudness reducing vibration pump . place soft cloth underneath your fountain , such doily or washcloth . i cut small piece plastic under cloth well , catch any water may splash out ruin varnish nightstand . ( 3 ) not enough " river rocks " included it . i like make mine look like it sitting pile stones all around base , not just front . remedy : purchase cheap bag tumbled stones arrange them yourself	-1

any dental health professional attest , flossing one teeth just important brushing , perhaps more so , bacteria causes gum disease ( certain extent cavities ) almost always starts teeth . daily flossing breaks up film harmful bacteria allows it removed . therefore , dentist , i am always stressing importance daily flosing my patients . my advice this : 1 . choose floss comfortable you right thickness your teeth . some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping floss around fingers , while others prefer thin flavored floss waxed thick floss . there so many options - choose right one you . 2 . waxed floss " waxed " allow easier passage teeth . waxed floss no more effective than unwaxed removing bacterial film build-up . important thing floss ! 3 . floss once daily , preferably before brushing . flossing breaks up film bacteria teeth areas toothbrush cannot reach . it important then brush teeth rinse teeth remove film bacteria flossing dislodged . without brushing or rinsing after flossing , bacteria reattach teeth . 4 . try tie flossing habit , such watching 10 pm news . i know it sounds strange , but incorporating flossing into habit leads one into developing new habit . some complain they don't time floss ; well , if flossing tied into habit , such watching tv , both easily concurrently . 5 . there many gimmicks manufacturers use sell their particular brand floss . some flavor floss , some incorporate fluoride into strands floss , some make their floss more slippery folks tight contacts . whatever case , most important point choose floss variety you use regularly . it mechanical act removing bacterial flim important part , not flavoring or chemical additions floss . 6 . if you want keep your teeth life-time , develop flossing habit . one wise sage said : " if you ignore your teeth , they eventually go away " . i recommend this product because it effective relatively easy use . i found it tends shred more than regular floss , this bothers me bit so i not use it regularly . i like mint flavor fluoride cannot hurt either . all all , it good product . jim " konedog " koenig , dds	-1

although this sunscreen not pasty white look like some other zinc-oxide sunscreens , it greasy , slippery shiny , plus it stings if you get it your eyes . not good sunscreen face . blue lizard sensitive sunscreen better choice my opinion , but trade off sensitive sunscreen ( which zinc oxide titanium dioxide ) pasty look . i planned use this sunscreen surfing running but i wouldn't recommend it those or similar activities	-1

finish not very smooth or fully blended . it doesn't live up its claim 14 hour moisturization either ( similar sunscreens other brands don't moisturize well , but they don't claim moisturize begin ) . so better apply moisturizer first then this sunscreen . however , it cheapest complete spectrum sunscreen sensitive skin . if you wanna pay nicer finish , go olay complete defense spf 30 sensitive skin ; or better protection 9.1% titanium oxide , go neutrogena spf 30 sunblock lotion sensitive skin . neutrogena one leaves even whiter finish though	-1

so far , this scale fairly good . it gave weights pretty close what other electronic scales gave ( . 5lb increment this scale precise enough , those you wanting . 2lb increment ) . my body fat measurements fairly consistent , it not varying more than 1% day day . but !!! main suspicion i this scale it seems " lazy " weight measurement change . what i mean ? let say , example , you weight yourself scale says 154lbs . if you step off , take off jacket u know weights 1.5 lbs , step scale again , scale show you still weight 154lbs . but ! here when it gets interesting , i suspected scale might ' shor t-t erm ' memory built into its eletronics simply go back most recently measured weight if difference weight small enough . so , i weighted myself , say , 154 , then made scale go some other weight , say 130 , then take off my jacket weight myself again , guess what ? i now get 152.5 lbs . so , summary , pretty precise good scale , but some reason , its designers decided build ' cheat ' like just give illusion it even more precise	-1

oral-b good product but refills certainly aren't worth what they charge them . i don't know you but it always annoyed me when you get held hostage company buy their refills item they sold you rip-off price . they could make great profit selling these refills something like $2.50 each , their rip off price $8.50 ea beyond absurd . other thing when you buy their toothbrush they something there like brush heads last 2 months . that real laugh . even brushing just once day , you're lucky if you get month out them . so not only they rip you off their refill cost , they also lie you get you locked into their product begin	-1

i am big fan regular clic reading glasses . i own several pairs think they great . however , sport goggles not get my vote confidence . they three problems which make them unusable me : 1 ) all clic products there all important stem adjustment adjusts length stems properly fit glasses onto your head . however , unlike very cool regular reading glasses clic , sport googles not adjust properly so goggles run very tight if you need even slightly above average stem legnth , 2 ) there also extra foam padding sport googles make them very snug , but because tight stems foam padding makes these glasses far too tight enjoy 3)the maker doesn't make it clear they should their description ... irridium ( red)colored lens some sports goggles far too intensely tinted dark any kind regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking rocky path . sorry clic , but your success reading glasses went your head ... you needed more user testing comfort vision sports goggles . i would like return them larger size lighter colored lens ... too bad me !	-1

i'm 26m , 6 ' 185 growing . work out regularly , mostly weights basketball . i'm allergic peanuts , which makes most protein bars off-limits me . this only bar i've found where non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts peanuts set off my allergies . incredible , if only reason . but there more . 20g protein . wow . this meal replacement if you're road or it mid-morning , early-evening or even late-night snack , especially if you're trying build lean muscle shooting 1.5 or more grams protein per pound body weight . it easy 20 . carbs real , review says . it clean energy , effective either before or after workout . i prefer take liquid protein after workout , body absorbs it faster , but pinch this would great choice . beyond it little crispy little chewy , there physical satisfaction eating it makes experience complete . but , review said , this isn't intended diet bar , it men women who work hard use lots energy throughout day , hence name " builders bar . " i guess if you ate half one instead meal , it might work way . finally taste outstanding , when stacked against other bars ( although i haven't tried many , due peanut allergies ) . if you close your eyes pretend , it really could dessert . i stick cookies cream or chocolate . chocolate yummy dunked hot coffee mid-morning . i buy box every two weeks keep stocked home , work oftentimes one car just case i get hungry . review said outside chocolate got crumbly , this true , if it gets hot melted . when things solidify they crumble . doesn't change taste but it messy . keep them cool you're good shape . i've even tried putting them freezer prior eating , not bad but no significant difference . thank you clif	1

i ordered this thermometer week ago , when i returned my doctor office sinus infection fever . i thought it would accurate , especially based reviews . when i received it , i took 10 readings . temperature went 103 degrees 95 degrees . no two same . last night i tried it my husband same effect . this disappointing waste money , say least . if there rating less then one star , i'd give it instead	-1
i've it one day it seems accurate . i calibrated ua-787ej against manual setup ( stethiscope , gauge cuff ) i purchased last week readings consistant . i read first review stated their disatisfaction b/c readings " high " . i would recommend calibrating unit yourself if it off , return it or refund . last week i've tested several monitors local stores ( omron , relion , lifesource ) i felt all them reported low bp readings . i even ordered one very eratic its readings but always 10 12 points lower than readings taken w/a stethiscope ( sometimes i used bp machine wal-mart , which seemed consistent ) . i returned it refund . i work hospital , co-worker used new ua-787ej this morning , found his blood pressure very high , went down er indeed it extremely high . if you doubts accuracy , i suggest purchasing manual steth ., gauge cuff your own calibartion . it only way i could confident automatic unit accurate reliable . manual setup only costs $16.00 wal-mart ( maybe less amazon ) taking your bp easy .	1

i wasn't sure what make all these conflicting reviews but i needed shaver this shaver represented pretty good value . i took chance i don't regret it . switched straight edge electric past , i knew my skin needed adjust new treatment . right box remington red warning tag says exactly . first few shaves rough ... my skin felt looked raw few patches . not good experience frankly it what i suspect most negative reviews here based . however , made this transition past i intent completing adjustment . well , it two weeks shaves fine . better than fine , shaves very close leaving wonderfully smooth face . irritation almost completely gone really only appears when i'm too vigorous parts my neck tender skin . i consider this more my fault than shaver . electric shaving isn't everyone . furthermore , there shavers which treat skin more tenderly but not produce close shave . given variety faces shavers there no " one size fits all " . however , if you like rotary electric shaving , you don't overly sensitive skin , you want really smooth close result then you should consider this shaver	-1

excellent scale- ever since i bought it , i've losing weight since i accurately tell how much i weigh . it must weight loss . i weighed 176 day i got it , i'm 157 right now . water percentage , it worthless- long you're over 50% ( male ) , your fine . it related body fat % . body fat % fluctuates too much great . it good rough estimate- but i go 16-19% depending when i weigh myself . i find i'm 16% when i follow recommended advice ( don't eat 2 hours then weight yourself ) , but that definitely too low my opinion . i still got small beer belly . 19% seems more accurate i get after i eat . but body fat percentage definitely gone down since i lost weight , so like i said -it good estimate , but don't worry 3% fluctuations . i think key this scale note your lowest weight ( morning when you get up , just weigh only option ) . way if weight goes down , you know you lost weight ! it amazing how many pounds you gain right after your eat ( clothes weight 2-5 pounds depending jeans/pajamas , etc .	-1

i bought this product hopes shave less often dual epilator/shaver feature . over all i am very pleased . like other reviewers i think legs armpits it works best shower when you nice lathered up soap - lather helps get rid friction head moves over skin it much smoother shave . i found without lather movement somewhat jerky , head didn't slide over skin smoothly it more painful . legs especially shins , it still painful although not painful epilator i tried . it works absolutely great ( when lathered up ) armpits . i both them quickly , completely very little pain - i think your armpits must less sensitive . i my bikini area - again definately works better hurts less when your skin lathered up . i say this definately painful process . while it still works great this area , i think waxing may stil best couple reasons . 1 ) waxing whole area one fell swoop therefore you only pain moment opposed several minutes epilator ; because your bikini line so sensitive , this makes big difference . 2 ) it nearly impossible epilate " shape " your grooming because bulkiness head . unless you're removing all hair it would difficult just certain area . ( this reason i gave four stars not five)i happend few mutant hairs my chin i pluck every now again ; just giggles i tried it my face ( dry ) . it worked awesome . i ran over my chin only couple times it got even smallest thinest hairs you couldn't really see . overall great product but not best bikini area	-1

i tried using my mom old hot rollers once ( heavy kind , spikes pins ) because i wanted curly hair , but easily discouraged because they really hard put they hurt my head . not so these rollers caruso ! steam itself heats up 1 minute or less rollers also heat up fast ( 1 roller time , 10 seconds or less ) , they're so easy put . they're foam , so they don't hurt my head , they're not too hot handle , shields hold each roller place securely so they don't fall out . you also use combs help wrap shorter pieces hair . i medium-length , thick hair , probably left rollers 45 minutes , although directions say you really only need leave them 15 minutes after putting last roller . longer doesn't hurt , though . neither blow drying speed up process . smaller rollers gave me look i going . they made my hair soft , manageable , curly . i skeptical first , but am pleasantly surprised results . it worth money . i would highly recommend this product	1

centrum-brand vitamins made quality company , which important buying vitamins . since vitamin industry not regulated fda , manufacturers put just anything label sell their product , many ! oft times supposed ingredients not even product , this why name-brand product essential . centrum-brand one consumer trust . centrum-silver product targeted adults those older than 55 years age . however , this vitamin formulation taken any adult effectiveness . vitamins elements chemical compounds help body cells function better , mostly area cell/body metabolism . if one eats balanced diet high greens fruits , extra store-bought vitamins probably not essential , vitamins supplied adequate quantities food consumed . however , typical american diet notorious high sugars low veggies fruits , therefore making supplemental vitamins important . diets high sugars demand more vitamin compounds help metabolize sugars . since average american consumes more than 110 pounds dietary ( table sugar : , sucrose ) sugars each year , supplemental vitamins important if not essential take daily basis . when selecting vitamin product , it important get basic vitamins , such a e , but it also important get minerals trace elements too , these compounds elements essential metabolism cellular health body various functions including immune system . this product all basics covered more , why i like it . most vitamin companies when formulating their vitamin compound give 100% rda or more . i am not believer mega-vitamins ( formulations provide many times more than rda ) because body only use so much extra generally excreted urine . only exception this rule fat-soluble vitamins , ( vitamin , , ) . fat-soluble vitamins stored excess body reach toxic levels . this mind , it makes no sense continually consume fat-soluble vitamins excess . one final thing : many manufacturers make claims their vitamin product going make you " feel " better , sensation vitality noticable . perhaps if you state malnutrition many years , this claim may valid some , but i taken vitamins most my life , i feel same whether i take them or not . rather than judge effectiveness vitamins how they " feel " , judge them instead knowing you all bases covered terms cell metabolism , once this covered , your cells healthy nutrition make them . jim " konedog " koeni	1
