this seems like great idea - food held basket , so you don't shove skewer through meat . however , little bolts hold down clamp onto rack meant tightened hand . if you sizable chicken , you cannot tighten these enough hand . i chicken fall out rack into flames more than once . then you tighten them pliers , but metal so soft you only this 2 or 3 times , then threads stripped whole thing useless ! again : hand tighten = chicken falls out ; tighten pliers = threads stripped . now i try get replacement parts rotisserie weber . good luck	-1

i am extreamly disappointed this product . icons not give indication type weather you expect . instead , they provide indication if weather getting worse or better . fluff out side box states : " forecast icon based changing barometric pressure .

i owned wmr-968 several years now spent more ' replacement ' parts than if i bought entire new unit . primarily , solar transmitter rain gauge continually fails bring charge up enough power transmitter transmit back base . i replaced this transmitter unit three times ( twice ' new ' style ) . living phoenix area , we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days , but soon it doesn't get sunlight any length time , display reads all dashes ( not receiving signal ) . so when it rains here , i usually don't get reading how much because this thing stops working . anemometer mounted same pole just above rain gauge both solar transmitters also mounted same pole . anemometer works consistently fine . both os local distributor say distance too far , unit must gone bad needs replacement , etc ., etc . replacing solar unit didn't help distance can't too far one unit not other . no one help this issue . so my suggestion would spend extra bucks get something more reliable .	-1

purchased 2 these my office am buying 2 more home . these easy set up , easy read , self adjusting daylight savings time " atomic " function ( self setting ) wonderful . earlier reviewer mentioned how reset when battery needs replacement which i found very helpful , so keep set up instructions handy refer if when you need replace batteries ! also purchased 2 larger 14 inch version they're just nice	1
considering i purchased this item my bedroom , i would say it perfect . aesthetic reasons i preferred analog wall clock , but thought hearing second hand tick all night not option until i found this item lacrosse . it could not anymore perfect , its looks , price , self ( time ) adjusting qualities made this . " m.f. " ( major find ) . now i sleep through daylight savings time adjustments not worry actual adjustment my clock , but whether or not i hour early , or late work	1
note : amazon description not include dimensions . package it recommends you measure first . it fits smokers 30 " ( 76cm ) across ( perhaps including handles , not sure ) 36 " ( 91cm)vertically . it bit big my standard-sized smoker ( 20 " across ) , so it unflattering its graceful curves , but good enough useful . it cheaply made , but looks like it suitable . i update my report if it falls apart use ( like reviewer said ) . it quite possible garbage bag would enough protect your grill . main advantage here it fits bit better , elastic close bottom bit . it probably looks bit better , if you care	-1
this good rack ; it cleaned pretty easily nice compact size but ribs just bit too close together ( i cook mainly full spare ribs ) . i rib racks steven raichlen perfect . more spacious racks allow better basting , heat distribution more even cooking . when meat touches like weber rack , meat doesn't cook well	-1
i bought this clock my pool deck it works great - it set itself within 10 minutes putting battery . i it wall overhang 4 feet , so it protected weather . you see it well across yard . several comments visitors - they think its great outdoor clock . thermometer not automatically set , you need set it . it seems work fine , i checked it couple times local temperature radio/tv . would recommend clock those looking outdoor time piece	1
i use table top grill 65 days year . only one i depend weber . only reason i replace it when mine get stolen	1
week ago i got this gas go-anywhere , i not sure if it right one or not cuz some negative reviews , so before i opened box i desided return it back , but i said my self why dont we give it chance , so i opened it i used it 2 steak rib-eyes ... ohh my god it immazing , ok .. it exactly like big gas bbq gril but smaller , so it very smart wat hold ,... meat not burned up it like tender , so if u small family u dont enough room big one get this one ... it good job steak so i think it'll great anything else ... i'll try chicken today ...	1
bought this umbrella last week ( 9/23/05 ) amazon . initially hesitant purchasing it due other reviews describing issue pole two pieces , which , when connected , never straight . all i want add here i not experience this problem . screw mechanism which joins poles seems sturdy , pole appears perfectly straight . i wonder if other people bought umbrellas bad batch or manufacturer redesigned connection mechanism ? ( most recent reviews not mention this problem)re . overall quality , i can't speak how pole or umbrella itself wear over time , but least initially it looks good quality sturdy construction . one thing note despite product description picture making it look like pole made wood , it appears actually made some sort metal which wood coloured ( it still looks like wood though would not look out place wooden patio furniture ) . honest i actually prefer this , since i would imagine it won't discolour easily natural wood should longer lasting . summary , am very pleased my purchase - i would happily recommend it others looking good quality umbrella very reasonable price	1
it funny how guys coming bbq all comment check out this grill	1
i owned only 2 grills my lifetime . both little , cheap unsuited my novice grilling status . when i committed buy real barbeque grill i read scores reviews descriptions find right one . after reading amazon customer reviews performer ( 827020 22.5 inch performer charcoal grill propane gas ingnition , purchased summer 2003 ) i so impressed i bought it . what grill ! i don't know how weber it ( convection , perhaps ? ) -- even my overdone meats come out moist flavorful . veggies come out great -- i grilled zucchini squash last summer , yumm ! this grill gives me best both worlds : gas charcoal . gas feature allows me light up quickly , rain or shine . small propane tank not primary energy source , so seldom needs refilling . charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor , my gardens love weber convenient one step ash disposal system . i cannot praise this grill enough . i only wish newer version inspired more positive reviews , hope friends i recommended performer still find this model	1
this grill 8 or 9 years .... unbelievable great product . 2nd house miss . river ... used almost year round , atleast twice week ... never problem .. highly recommend if like charcoal opposed gas ..	1
america test kitchen rated it number one , so i decided try one myself . i owned grill brushes home depot , online catalog sellers , etceteras . bristles , regardless material , these brushes end up shedding over time , or if not they crush down become nearly worthless . grill wizard eliminates these problems using replaceable pad . pad works great . i'm still my first pad used it probably 10 times or more already . it good product i highly recommend it	1
this product works very well , it also good range . mine 20ft away my recieve it works fine through walls	1
i bought this unit 4 years ago . it performed flawlessly . i'm still amazed how often rain prediction turns out correct . it hitting 90% accuracy rain within 36 hours . better than weather dude television	1
i one these when they first came out loved it . this one even better . i would say it must someone trouble getting steak medium rare . since purchasing this item , i once again perfect steak . i am so glad i found this fork again . i am one happy person	1
great product , durable quality stitching . worth its price protect your grill	1
just got this mail my char-broil grill , so this point i cant speak how it hold up over time . nonetheless , this appears exceptionally sturdy well-made product . nice , thick , heavy , two layers - canvas like exterior black lining . price , i cant imagine there better grill cover market . one caveat i would offer one many reviewers noted , color not pictured . amazon photo shows almost teal green white middle section . photos product box call color ' mountain green ' show forest green type color , cream colored middle . mine , however , dark olive color , one could easily called brown ad green , middle section cool , cement-y grey , not warm white all . it looks nice , great cover great price . but if youre ordering this match your patio furniture ( i certainly wasn't!) then this something aware . only other warning i would offer make sure it fits your grill . its big cover , not very adjustable . fits my char-broil grill perfectly , but it would look ridiculous smaller grill . only features i would wish here loop or hook outside cover , so i could hang it up when grilling , instead just draping it somewhere , drawstring some sort bottom , hold it closed . still , it so heavy well made , im certainly not complaining .	-1
we received this christmas gift come dependon it daily time weather . it displays accurate time , temperature weather " tendency " using rising or fallingpressure . it not display actual pressure numbers , only indicating rising or falling pressure . outside temp . pressure info transmitted wirelessly small unit mounted outside range 200 feet . quality unit good i would recommend anyone wanting accurate time standard which all clocks watches could set	1
i've owned this smoker 6 years great success turning out turkeys , pulled pork , ribs , etc . couple tips took me some time work out . 1 ) cover water pan some heavy duty foil after filling it . this'll prevent liquid boiling away too quickly . you won't refill it during smoking , it'll prevent smoker getting too " wet " inside . when i left it uncovered , i getting steamed meat , not smoked . 2 ) drill hole bottom unit , get drip pan underneath it . this'll allow any condensation drip out rather than collecting bottom smoker promoting rust . 3 ) get some heavy duty foil beneath heater element . makes cleanup much easier , gets heat reflected up food . fun ...	1
this unit well-built , last , easy use . assembly breeze . we it almost two years it performs superbly all types cooking -- it heats up quickly ( gets hot ! ) , yet flames turned way down never blow out . we use it several times week propane canister lasts three four weeks . course , if you turn all its mighty burners leave ' em way , it'll eat lot propane . but kind usage would quickly cremate anything you might cooking . i suspect people who complain propane consumption this barbecue cooking hood up , contrary weber instructions ( common sense ) . , let face it , any barbecue six mighty burners like these use its share propane . pluses : thick , solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully last forever . you want solid bars ! thermal inertia key good grilling . stainless means no rusty taste , no chipping , easy clean . fine flame control . six burners let you configure heat way you want . rotisserie smoker box thier own burners ! side burner works well too cooking veggies stuff pot . powerful yet capable gentle cooking . won't rust . built like tank . no cheap chinese componentry often found even formerly premium brands , all " house brands " , most which made entirely china , even big stainless-steel extravaganzas sell thousands . don't fooled fancy knobs gewgaws -- quality just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today . i've personally witnessed two big top-of-the-line house brand barbecues returned leading warehouse retailer irate purchasers who couldn't believe they'd crap out after year . never happens weber . convenient fold-down work surfaces . easy clean . huge cooking area . anti-flare burner configuration works well . lights instantly . easy wheel around yard -- something i wanted able , which built-in wouldn't allow . fantastic weber service . mine manhandled shipping company ; weber handled my complaint shipping company me ( i didn't anything all ) sent me new panel without any hassle all . their 24-hour support hotline best i've used anywhere any product , emails handled same-day . negatives : expensive ( but worth it ) . i'd buy it again heartbeat . it my first weber after years thinking they only popular because they're stylish . now i get it .	1

i just bought new genesis after owning my last one 11 years . excellent product . there plenty product info this page amazon manufacturer , so let me tell you few things i make my weber work best me . -most importantly ... keep it covered . amazon sells cover ... get it . not coving it cut its life half least . -cover funnel shaped grease drip pan tin foil change it regularly ; otherwise build-up trap catch fire not make steak taste very good . -change disposable grease traps regularly ( otherwise they start stink ) . -get yourself quality wire brush use it before each use ... not after . build-up cooking grates after each use actually protects them elements . -before each use , after you wire brush grates , put some cooking oil some paper towels wipe grates down . -pre-heat grill high least 5 - 10 minutes ; it burns off anything left over cleaning makes cooking grates nice hot . -initiate cooking steaks , chops , any cuts meat ( even burgers ... no , not hot dogs ) just-over-medium heat 2 minutes each side flip before cooking your liking . this brief searing each side locks flavor your cut meat . -cook closed cover ; normal cuts meat shouldn't take more than total 10 minutes ( including searing ) . -let your meat sit up 5 minutes before slicing ( or biting into it ! ) . this locks juices ; if juices too hot when you slice ( or bite ) , they'll run right out your cut mea t.t here you go . hope helps . don't forget cover grill after it cools . bon appetit !	1
wonderful grill . everything we expected . shipping problem . showed up week late . sat home three different delivery dates before shipper finally showed up . grill slightly damaged - we elected keep it rather than start shipping hassles over again . not sure money we saved buying through amazon worth it	1

this very nice cover , it heavy-duty vented rear top . others say this cover fits tight- it , but i get it off myself . trick , since cover little stiff , you hold it one hand above grill , while you use your other hand guide it grill . then it slides down fits properly . it looks awesome- really sets my grill apart my neighbors ' " unkept " grills ! :)	1
my porch my backyard , there used tons annoying insects flying around , because we live very near pond we woods . ever since i got this terrific product , i bug free almost 3 months now ! i go back bar-b-ques again ! this most amazing product ever created	1

my 15 year old son put grill together while i work . grill very even heat distribution very good heating controls . i cooked steak high temperatures chicken low temperatures . all items come out great so far . stainless steel cooking surfaces internal parts appear like they last time . my last weber grill lasted 12 years . i expect this one well or better . my only disappointment this grill not come configured quick-connects like last grill . it uses standard screw type connection gas bottle	1

1st , i've read thousand reviews this my first , yeah , maybe last . i've it 3 months after month #1 it deserved 3 stars . after month 2 earned 4 stars .... now top rated . it chicken best . lid ( con ) doesn't fit tight rotisserie ring so fire burns hotter than i would like . so .... this what i : 1- skewer 2 chickens thru chest-back angle . then season dry garlic herb ( or lemon pepper ) . if you season first then most removed when skewered . seperate chickens onion or potato . don't tie . 2- center charcoal 6 " wide across center kettle side side . when fire 1/2 started put chickens above flame . fire burn fully because lid doesn't seal ( remember ? ) . flavor where flame meets chicken . no other way work .. 3- cook 45 minutes or til skin pulls away end chicken legs . looks burnt ? skin might but inside great . trust me . take it off grill let it rest 20 minutes . flame still going ?? skewer some red or white potatoes . tastes great sooo moist ! pack leftovers sealed plastic bag it keep week . ok , i am guessing part . mine only lasts few days .. con cost . it should included skewer length basket holding ribs , fish etc . so this end my review . i bought some junk ' net ..... but this one my better choices . jc , tamp	1

like several other reviewers , my smoker also came badly damaged . i bought this use going away party planned smoking 25 lbs . ribs . when it arrived i saw how badly damaged it , i immediately e-mailed amazon they shipped me replacement next day . my replacement also came damaged ( worst than original ) . it one day before party i no choice but use it even though it damaged . i must say ribs turned out great . i am very impressed this smoker it ease use but return them due amount damage both units . i believe this smoker well worth price would give it 5 stars if they would just package it better . i also give 5 stars amazon it great customer service .	-1

we original hatteras rope hammack which we purchased when we lived north carolina . i love it but rope tends stretch too much requires rehanging tighten it . we informed it would when we purchased it four years ago , but now it seems more work than it worth . solid quilted design seems like it would better would require less maintenance . also , our poodle-mix pet just loves it . she would try jump before we could even get it hanged . we attach cover it keep her paws going through ropes , so adds value solid design . thanks listening me we plan purchasing guilted hammack soon possible	1
i use my hammock 75% year find it extremely comfortable . it bit expensive but i guess long run it worth it . i mesh hammocks only last one season . i think this one going last years	1

i'm my second mr. bar-b-q wood brush long they keep selling it value price , i imagine i keep buying them . no , they don't last forever -- eventually bristles get clogged greasy sludge ( how long depends frequency use ) , but while it lasts , it fine job cleaning scraping your grill . what sets it apart long handle large head covered brass bristles . while those bristles could stand bit longer , they still longer than many . scraper side quite strong not bend or break easily . you get lot your money this solid product which could last several seasons	-1

this lounge/deck chair cushon worth every peny . it thick , comfortable ( none those deck chairs comfortable without substantial cushion ) , available several color choices , soft , not plasticky , cover fabric . you measure width your deck chair carefully see if it fit . it just barely fit my ' titanic ' deck chair because i scrunch it up bit near arms . but all turned out well i must say i am very happy it . it quality product keep you much more comfortable during your hours patio than those cheaper , but much thinner , types sold outlet stores or supermarkets summer . get best . this it	1

i gave one my nephew christmas he everyone else liked it so well everybody family tried it out i now order one his mother also one my husband . projection feature great projection display actually larger brighter than i thought it would . honest i mention drawback - display clock itself so small not backlit so you pretty close it see time during day . until someone puts projection feature larger size cd/alarm clock , we continue keep our old alarm clock put this one other side bed use it mainly projection feature . even drawback mentioned , we all love clock . my nephew loves able see what time it without putting his glasses	1
this griddle very useful , especially if you bring your grill camp site . surface cooks evenly if sufficiently heated good job . first i thought it solid cast iron but upon further inspection found it some kind high temperature coating . my only criticism it isn't more non-stick surface food hard clean off after use . gee whiz factor great when you whip it out around other people who little stamped metal travel grills . this item really rounds out baby q options .	-1
two days after buying this swing i found just exact thing i looking contacted don , seller , refund . even though it sunday , he got right back me said he'd make every effort cancel order , even though it ships direct his supplier . he kept me informed every step way while he what he could cancel . tuesday , i got word order cancelled full refund given . it such stress-free exchange . i would recommend this buyer sure	1
if you looking this very accurate , then you need use lithium batteries . because cold temps here , cheaper batteries not work well . maybe where it doesn't get minus temps , rayovac batteries okay , but not here ne . sensor needs put location , out sun , out reach your pets , children . which makes little decision making time , your part .	-1

guys , this great purchase . it quality unit bigger than it looks package . charbroil fabulous job making such good little unit such good price . unless you're looking something totally snazzy willing spend lot money , don't pass this one up	1
i bought these lounge chairs because other positive reviews i read them . i say i am very happy them too . color very nice antique color matches set we got costco few years back . i can't wait those warm summer days evenings sit around pool enjoy lounging these chairs . they not too heavy , so they easy move around . they heavy enough santa ana winds we here beautiful southern california not blow chairs around all . i think price these very good price value would recommend them . i only wish you could pick your color material cushions . beige color matches what we but little drab since our house patio cover same color . i see they sell replacement cushions different colors , but it would nice choice color when ordering originals	1
i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges ( 2 ) they would only temporary until i could afford " good ones " because they so inexpensive . well these good i don't need replace them . design actually matches my table set i didn't even realize it until we unpacked them -- fully assemled ! i only one complaint it really not bad . thickness cushion seems fine me but my skinny butt husband tells me cushions aren't cushiony enough . other than , chaises absolutely wonderful good quality	-1
this chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations . i'd shopped around didn't want spend $400 plus chaise lounge . this great price plus you get free shipping . they arrive completely assembled well packaged . very attractive , sturdy , most importantly , very comfortable . i highly recommend . got side table ice bucket love it well	1
i high ceiling so display time fuzzy i missed see-through case red night light earlier model but overall , i satisfied clock	-1
i recently purchased this clock it great little clock ! time temp cool features well projection which very cool useful . projection ( usually ceiling ) not too bright hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening . only problem projection unless you clock side numbers project upside down . i mean say if you it facing you straight ahead numbers above clock upside down . atomic feature bit tricky also . i live central nj when setting up clock first time it didn't pick up any signal . after i searched signal , took batteries out tried everything i knew everything manual mentioned it wouldn't get signal . so i write email company they sent me response several suggestions , one worked most useful search signal ( pressing down arrow ) then while its searching place it where it recieve full signal , which shown meter left , like cell phone . once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself ( you may need take it outside ) ... this take 10 mins days . my case it took 5 mins . so it set signal company says once it sets you put it where you want it keep signal . other than problem , which fixed , clock hassle free very easy use . i highly recommend it . oregon scientific also helpful i sent them thank you email stressing they need put more signal suggestions manual , because if they i wouldn't needed bother email customer service . hopefully most people didn't give up easily kept trying get signal set if they didn't they may returned clock needlessly . alarm loud enough me awaken snooze button useful top so it reached easily drowsy stupor . overall it cute , useful , stylish clock .	1
i oregon scientific clock last 7 years , finally replace it because soda spill . i knew i wanted oregon scientific clock this best choice . fact this one works better then old one ( no long cord humongous antenna ) i love time ceiling feature . yes it only works when no sunlight room but i dont sleep during day . i highly recomend this product	1

i cannot wait party . i purchased both this fire pit table . both pieces easy assemble , sturdy really fun ! my sister going so jealous . what sisters	1
different , visually striking , very comfortable . only pedantic problem hinges seem rust which may problem later , excellent value . go look crate barrel comparison	1

they very attractive we no trouble putting them together . our only complaint - stain ran during rain storm stained our patio	-1
if you searching adirondack chairs , like i few weeks ago , you find wide array prices -- too ridiculous mention . this strathwood 79.99 10 shipping steal ! i not able find them cheaper anywhere ! you get chair foot stool which why i rated it 4 stars . quality decent , i think price you get what you pay bit more . kit comes almost constructed -- you final screws . chair comes pre oiled , however i highly recommend oiling it again , if you want color last . i also recommend teaqua , not use conventional teak oil . i agree previous reviewer if you sit chair hour it get uncomfortable , however i purchased cushions it , sitting hour not problem . construciton sturdy , they sitting my deck month now all well . mahalo	-1
i ordered this my dad christmas . i worried it wouldn't fit him because he large man , but thought what heck i'll use it if he can't . i opened box i wasn't sure it looked like sack ropes . then i began unfolding , unfolding , unfolding before long thing stretched least 14 feet across my kitchen . loops just great seem so strong . only drawback its not very soft but i guess it wouldn't all sturdy made out chenille would it . now all i need buy him home depot giftcard so he get so sturdy posts hardware he set !!	1
this clock great people who sleep their backs . if you happen lying your stomach though , you turn over see time ceiling or reach over clock press snooze button briefly turn clock light . i wish clock itself lighted time display . also we 11 foot ceilings so display little dim . snooze button top . it big easy press but button turn alarm off small front below display . you grab clock awkward way hold button down second turn alarm off . clock automatically set time . i impressed this we live near bottom apartment building surrounded other tall buildings no clear view sky .	-1
i got my grill go advantage just recently very pleased so far . makers grill 2 go appear heard some criticisms earlier models taken into consideration this grill . open flame cooking preferable previous models , it still easy transport , it made tailgating friends before watching my tarheels play basketball lot fun . i completely disagree other reviewer who seems reviewing wrong product since this grill not use non-stick cooking surface cooking area	1
gadget i . price , this really neat outdoor thermometer shows high low temperature day . one important note location installation . i live . fla mounted it north facing window . you must locate it spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight not affect it this most likely give false readings . if you glass door or window leads screen enclosure , this would also allow fairly correct temperature reading , although this could also cause improper readings heat day metal pan roof reflect heat inside screen enclosure . all all , i love mine reccomend it . i bought 10 them christmas gave them out gifts	1
fits well . eventhough i just bought it , i think it going sustain extreme virginia weather couple years	1

this great umbrella - quality excellent price , it arrived timely packaged well . color not bright yellow , but more maize yellow , but coordinates well my brightly striped chair cushions ! i think more muted color help keep it looking nice longer - i think brighter yellow would fade and/or look discolored sooner	1
i've owned bounty hunter land star 2 years now it great , economically priced detector . shop around because you get it less then one hundred dollars if you know where look ... cough ... ebay ... cough ... ebay . i've found tons silver coins this detector . it target processor extremely reliable coins . if you get solid repeatable coin tone then you've got 95% chance digging up coin . i've also found civil war buttons , old toys , multiple rings beach . yesterday i found 2 mercury head dimes ( 1918 1941 ) local park . believe me when i tell you treasure ground everywhere . contrary review you may see below , all-metal mode works exactly it should . not only it work it should , but it most useful descriptive mode this machine . mr. david carlson obviously doesn't know how operate his metal detector . symptoms he describes result someone not reading manual . he doesn't understand relationship all-metal mode ground balance . it just takes moment read understand . bottom line : great metal detector get you into hobby cheaply so you begin finding some great stuff . like i said , i've using mine 2 years i don't feel need upgrade	1
i've only used my rack cooking chickens , but i'm looking forward doing turkey soon . i've never sprayed rack non-stick cooking spray , there no need . everything comes off , it cleans up beautifully dishwasher . i like fact i put chicken rack way before i put it grill - rack makes it easy get chicken back into house , too . i typically put rack cooked chicken cookie sheet , carve chicken right rack . well made , tons uses , yet inexpensive . it get any better	1

nice cushions dry out pretty fast . seem durable . they also seem high quality . only thing they more tan color -- picture shows them white which what i really wanted . but they nice . could use strap top also so wind doesn't constantly blow them over	-1
i didn't know much grills so i asked around . everyone told me get weber grill , after reading reviews i could see why . i just got my grill this weekend we used it 3 times already .. we love it ! very sturdy/solid , super easy use . all you need turn gas , turn knob .. press ignitor ! everything we cooked come out perfectly , very even cooking . this grill may not all bells whistles , but you bet it last years come .	1
don't hesitate buy this grill !!!! past few years i've switching back forth my gas grill my good ole weber kettle grill . like everyone else i prefer grilling over charcoal , so this seemed like perfect grill me ... i right ! this grill takes all pain away grilling charcoal . one push button 15 minutes later i am grilling ribeyes . yes ! it simple . chimney revolutionized how i grilled charcoal , but this 10 times better than tha t.t he propane ignition rocks , work area great , lid holder nice addition , water proof charcoal holder more convenient than i thought it would . let us not forget it dual purpose thermometer ! it took me 40 minutes assemble , but that expected . oh yeah , i ordered it monday it delivered thursday .	1
i just love this grill . i previously regular weber kettle charcoal grill , but when my son took it college i perfect excuse upgrade . grill large enough grill meat veggies family 4 6 . cooking grate hinged sides . this allows you easily add more coals every hour or so extended indirect grilling cooking . you won't believe how handy very large stable table ; it very durable cleans up nicely . store your large bag charcoal rain protected bin , then just pull out bag pour charcoal right into 2 charcoal holders . charcoal holders keep coals gathered together light well eliminate need " charcoal chimney " . you only need run propane burner 5 minutes get coals started , so one canister lasts quite long . ( i always set timer so i don't forget turn it off . ) charcoal holders perfect indirect grilling , just push them sides kettle when coals ready . if direct grilling , you still use charcoal holders heat coals , then use tongs dump coals onto bottom grate when they ready . very convenient . bottom wire shelf makes perfect spot set hot charcoal holders after you dump coals into grill . stainless steel ash catcher works very well . ( non-stainless ash catcher my regular kettle grill didn't work smoothly used catch jam sometimes . ) lid holder really great . just pick up lid slide it left it held place you . no more trying hang lid little lid hook . thermometer very handy monitor temperature longer cooking items . if you bbqing ribs or roast , keeping temperature regulated low important . all these little conveniences simply add up nice cooking experience . i enjoy my gas grill too , but it takes little more skill cook over charcoal . i feeling accomplishment satisfaction when i serve up perfectly cooked meal my beautiful weber performer grill . find spot show it off - this beauty really looks great yard	1
i love this thing . it , course , basically weber kettle , which all you need . tweaks terrific , though . gas starter works like charm . i'd thought moving lighter fluid chimney made getting grill going almost clean predictable turning your kitchen oven , but this even better . work surface really handy , kettle top holder dirt-simple but works just fine , charcoal trays indirect cooking nice , charcoal storage handy ( but more this minute ) . built-in thermometer really asset . it ordinary meat thermometer sit top kettle or removed use food . it very helpful when slow-cooking using kettle top know what temperature ( fun , beside , see grill " breathe " coals burn down , or you add more , or vents get adjusted , or whatever ) . then when you're you pull it out check meat . simple but great . all little things add up make this cut above . few things . instructions come grill read mean it necessary use charcoal trays gas starter . you don't; either chimney or just pile charcoal work perfectly well . turning gas knob just enough get flame , running starter short times , extend tank life ; three minutes or so seems plenty get fire started . look scoop or something similar use charcoal holder , or plan getting your hands dirty moving charcoal . overall , though , this great setup . i hickory-smoked leg lamb last night die , two-and-a-quarter hours pressing starter button table . fabulous .	1
this truely must . flat non-stick skewers holds everything place , they won't flop around so unbalanced pieces food always bottom near heat . friend told me these gander mountain selling $7.39 set , but i checked here 1st found them $5.99 set . i ordered 5 sets !! skewers 14 " long plenty food . get yours today , don't wait . get least 2 sets .	1
i one these , this one my sister motorhome . it makes great little game or card table , eating doing small craft table . folds up nicely height adjustment .	1
bench easy assemble , lid actuallydoes work well . it not item lastforever , but it priced fairly what it -- storagebench .	-1
this storage bench great storing pool items or anything you keep outside . it easy put together i got it friday sale $69.99 , so price awesome ! all other benches like this i researched over $100.0	1
this table twice table you would expect price . its size ideal 2 passenger teak bench . kompur wood so like teak ; we're staining our teak furniture match kompur wood . it looks marvelous 30 " round folding table . fit finish plus . can't rate durability yet or it would 5 stars	-1
i agree previous reviewer who noted temperature discrepancy . items placed closer firebox get much hotter than those smokestack end . this probably my only complaint this smoker . this problem moderated somewhat . you create makeshift baffle aluminum flashing help some . you also put aluminum drip pan full water directly front opening which not only deflect some heat but introduce some humidity into cooking section . personally , i just don't fill it up meat . if you're doing several slabs ribs , use rib rack far end . airflow temperature control problems me first . my particular smoker works best air intake vent completely closed . this not air-tight smoker so it still drawing air through cracks door . keeping fire low vent closed , temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees . concerning temperature -- forget putting thermometer space provided brinkmann . it too high lid it read quite bit higher than food grate level . heat rises , you know . i drilled hole just above handle mounted thermometer . when i cook grates upper level , this thermometer reads just right level food . when i cook lower level , actual temperature 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads . it not totally precise but , hey , it barbeque!!!i've this smoker 3-4 years . i keep it under covered area so it doesn't get rained but humidity my area always high . i've repaint it once . firebox needs repainting now but that only maintenance i've it . i just clean out ashes food drippings after each use roll it under covering until next time . before each use , i line firebox cooking section heavy duty aluminum foil . makes clean-up lot easier . ( what we before reynolds ? )i don't smoke lot brinkmann . mostly i use weber kettle grill . but every time i brisket or big roast or several slabs ribs , i crank this baby up it never failed me yet . keep temperature low , keep eye fire don't open cooking section very often . just let nature , low heat smoke their job .	-1
i mine 4 years it worked out great . main difference this offset barbecue more expensive ones lack complete air control . there simply too many open seams allow air . so ... it takes bit tending keep temperature 215f . said , bit patience practice , you make excellent barbecue this thing . metal gauge heavy enough last you several years ( though eventually firebox burn out )	-1
i purchased this last year i love this grill . i always check consumer reports they rated this very highly - i agree . cooking cinch this grill - wide grill cooks evenly ! only way this grill catch fire if you not clean grease after each cooking session . fortunately , lowe putting whole bunch these grills together when i looking one so i bought one fully assembled . way cool	1
after few years use , original rack my gold grill rusty unusable . this exact replacement fits like original , making grill much more usuable again .	1
i changed my stinger rating 5 , 1 ( there no o ! )stinger : pros- mosquito lure , killed lotsa bad insects ( first , then wouldn't zap small insects !? )- but ! cons- their electric wire grid uses square wires quickly clog up . pretty soon it packed solid killing nothing ! i keep blowing it out ( air compressor ) every couple days- hassle ! flowtron " 80 ! " ( took puny 40 back ! )- pros- killed lots more bugs , because it never clogs up ( zaps small insects too ! ) ! electric rods straight up/down , so no cross wires catch falling insects clog . dead insects fall out bottom- blow clean once month ... i used stinger mosquito lure , purchased wally world ... cons- only con outer protective plastic cage bars only 1/2 " apart ( same stinger)- this kept larger moths ... able easily get electric grid . i used large wire cutter cut out every 3d bar- top 2/3ds cage- alternating ..., so cut bar middle two solid bars adajacent side- still rigid ! i put it outside timer ( when evenings cool down- not much insect activity below 55 degrees ... ) . adjust accordingly . never hang it near door , their always 10'+ swarm insects around it . try hang it over head high , dry ( electric ) area .	1
accurate , easy program good look . well worth $ spent	1
i've this weather station month now . it seems get accurate readings - only if you find good spot your remote sensor . bit sunshine make your readings higher than normal ( outside ) . couple complaints : one reviewer said buttons make unit feel cheap , they feel clunky . but , i only used them get it all setup so its no big deal . i've some mixed results barometer . when actual pressure mid-range its right ( i've chcked some readings local airports see how acurate it ) . but when low or high pressure system moves readings off more than i'd expect . however important thing you see pressure changing right direction . lastly , forecasting model it uses hasn't worked me ... yet . i live west denver , close mountains . this probably creates local weather pattern unit cannot predict . i not expect it , but we've some rain , snow , fog unit claims it observe not . it only month so i expect see prediction accurate some time . overall , i am happy this product think it worth money . there many other models i looked i think this gives most money	-1
cover great . velcro holds cover place wrapping around handles , preventing wind blowing it off . it nice leave fireplace out winter , knowing it protected elements .	1
very easy set up . pop aa battery , push button back your time zone us ( or you set manually , but then why ? unless you out us time zones . ) find spot wall it , hammer nail , leaving it stick out little hold clock , put clock up ( hardest part , it just hole flush back , but ! if you put it close door , you see hole nail ) walla ! few minutes , clock sets itself ! what could more easy ? my cat even found it amusing watch clock hands move until reached exact time ! ;) clock made finely textured plastic outside , but looks lot nicer than picture . great match black , silver /or designer computers , black leather desk chairs , etc . office or computer room . directions say set it up late night preferrably , if used interior rooms office buildings it may not able pick up signal set , thus you'd it manually . clock larger than it looks well , which easier eyes than other clocks . price certainly right well . i bought old black school-type clock my kids when they young , very similar this one , since my son took it him when he moved out i wanted replacement ! ( my mom bought old one when my youngest baby , when my older child learning tell time . it through dropped when moving , few earthquakes just keeps ticking ! i feeling this one same it well made compared many less expensive clocks out there - espcially projection type , which i thought might great idea until i saw reviews how many different projection clocks simply don't work , cheaply made , friend daughter got one her birthday , which didn't work either . ) great kids learning tell time too , so this could go just anywhere modern decor room . awesome ! i'm very happy it so far	1
this lounge/deck chair cushon worth every peny . it thick , comfortable ( none those deck chairs comfortable without substantial cushion ) , available several color choices , soft , not plasticky , cover fabric . you measure width your deck chair carefully see if it fit . it just barely fit my ' titanic ' deck chair because i scrunch it up bit near arms . but all turned out well i must say i am very happy it . it quality product keep you much more comfortable during your hours patio than those cheaper , but much thinner , types sold outlet stores or supermarkets summer . get best . this it	1
good product general . one came bit bent clever automatic lock unlock wouldn't work until i unbent it . i ordered 3 , billed three received 2 . amazon now " junk " my inbox	-1
i use this tailgating primarily . it great because it cooking size much bigger than it counterparts . it holds temps well cooks evenly like all webers . it bit bigger than smaller smokey joe , but nicer job because it size . i use it often continue so . too bad it discontinued .	1
weber discontinued it amazon no longer it . my pal condo balcony ( not large ) this weber her - equip it one charcoal rail you get lots indirect heat smoking . usually 14 inch smokey joe too small , often my 22 inch performer too big , but this jumbo joe just right . weber - bring it back !!	1
this excellent little grill home or road . lid lock godsend side benefit due construction piece , smokey joe apt name . carry handle awesome . side vents direct air such i almost always beautiful smoke filling my little grill infusing my meal fabulous flavor . i've mine over decade while i've gone through big weber kettle now huge smoker , this little number still race i no intentions giving it up . i'm taking it camping me next weekend . it no-brainer . buy it happy	1
whatever reason , weber renamed genesis line spirit 2007 . i just bought new weber genesis 3 weeks ago ( prior name change ) after owning my last one 11 years . there 3 burner model 2 burner model . if you're reading this you're looking 2 burner model . excellent product . 2 burners more than sufficient ; i don't know why they even 3 burner model since 3 burner model isn't really much bigger . 2 burner model plenty room needs everyday family grilling entertaining decent size group . there plenty product info this page amazon manufacturer , so let me tell you few things i make my weber work best me . -most importantly ... keep it covered . amazon sells cover ... get it . not coving it cut its life half least . -cover funnel shaped grease drip pan tin foil change it regularly ; otherwise build-up trap catch fire not make steak taste very good . -change disposable grease traps regularly ( otherwise they start stink ) . -get yourself quality wire brush use it before each use ... not after . build-up cooking grates after each use actually protects them elements . -before each use , after you wire brush grates , put some cooking oil some paper towels wipe grates down . -pre-heat grill high least 5 - 10 minutes ; it burns off anything left over cleaning makes cooking grates nice hot . -initiate cooking steaks , chops , any cuts meat ( even burgers ... no , not hot dogs ) just-over-medium heat no more than 2 minutes each side flip before cooking your liking . this brief searing each side locks flavor your cut meat . -cook closed cover ; normal cuts meat shouldn't take more than total 10 minutes ( including searing ) . -let your meat sit up 5 minutes before slicing ( or biting into it ! ) . this locks juices ; if juices too hot when you slice ( or bite ) , they'll run right out your cut meat . there you go . hope helps . don't forget cover grill after it cools . bon appetit !	1
so far i am very happy this purchase . it seems relatively accurate temperature , humidity pressure readings , atomic clock sets itself every night . i love sunrise/sunset times well moon phase displays , it very easy get data any city any date without permenantly change date or city unit . very cool . i don't like fact moon phase display " backwards " - full moon , my opinion , should full white circle new moon should black circle . this unit shows moon black instead white . but once you get used this , it no big deal . i really like fact all buttons front unit . some other la crosse products buttons back or other hard reach places . i found few problems design . there curved glass ( or plastic ) cover over entire display very reflective . reflections make it impossible read across room . fact it difficult read standing right front it because reflections . it best stand just slightly right or left . i excited fact display shows high low temperature humidity all times each 3 sensors . however , i dissapointed you can't recall date time high low recorded , you other la crosse products . also , when you reset high/low , you reset all sensors once instead able reset each individually . it challenging set up 3 remote sensors , especially when you more than 1 base unit , but it ( i also la crosse alarm clock projects time outdoor temp ceiling , so i wanted get both units read same sensor #1 ) . although this may sound like negative review , it really not . features functionality this unit far outweigh it shortcomings . i would definitely recommend this anyone who wants features it provides . make sure dimensions fit your needs . it might bit large sit desk - best hang it wall . it also comes oak instead brushed aluminum sides .	-1

i am impressed accuracy durability this item , but it far " instant read " . i conduct several temperatue audits major food chain many readings take several minutes stabilize . overall , it worth cost	-1

this attractive 10 " clock , white face , silver bezel ( also available black ) . unique feature ability synchronize atomic clock ( wwwvb ) ft . collins , co . watching hands speed around dial it initially sets itself worth price clock itself . we bought one play room liked it so much we bought two more . after placing battery , clock begins searching signal . generally it only takes couple minutes sync , but it came take up 24 hours . you need set time zone which you live ( pacific , eastern , etc ) . clock automatically adjusts dst ( part wwwvb signal , apparently ) . if you live areas country don't recognize dst , there button clock disable dst offset . note clock receive wwwvb signal , it cannot shielded environment . we've no problems our home placing unit various rooms outside window , but i suspect it might not work windowless basement ( which case it functions regular clock ) . my company bought ton similar clocks , only find they cannot receive signal windowless , steel building . your mileage may vary	1
this good brush , i think it bit overpriced though . i would rather saved money got brush . it good , but not worth this much	-1
i bought this unit some adirondack chairs small table so i may sit outside during winter ( not severe weather ) smoke cigar . i must say besides attractive easy assemble this fire pit allows anywhere from2 6 people comfortably sit around it stay warm . i burn hard woods it anywhere neighborhood 2 - 4 hours not noticed any warping or buckling , door little flexible but it made same screen material rest unit holding up nicely . it opens closes easily . if your wood propensity popping i noticed screen material could considered touch too large , but i don't think it enough minus give this fire pit any less ratin	1

there really nothing more said further reputation this series grills . those us own genesis e-310 series grill know how well this grill manufactured , just how very well it performs its duties . it , far , very best gas grill this price range i ever owned or used . couple notes : -the cross-over ignition system works wonderfully ( it takes less than 3 seconds fire up all three burners-those who say their gas grill not get hot enough sear meats don't own this grill- i've it up 550 degrees very cold mn winter day-that said , it seems go through good amount propane when running all 3 burners high ... but probably obvious considering temps you obtain when running it full . ( it interesting see if i get 500 + degrees sear meats medium setting summer day .... ) . fuel gauge inside cabinet also handy feature-as always this series grills- no flare ups , flavorizer bars what weber says they , namely vaporize fats juices into smoke adds flavor what you grilling-to keep this review balanced , there one negative- i dislike tool holders . although there plenty , your tools pretty much one those leather hanging loop things keep tools falling off or even use holders ( small price pay i guess)finally , genesis e-310 i purchased came copper color , something i haven't seen amazon , or weber site matter . maybe i missed it , or maybe i got lucky . either way , it looks pretty darn sharp our deck when it isn't covered	1

good move part brilliant engineers weber who decided go 18 1/2 instead 19 ! gold touch ??? try diamond platinum touch ! this grill baby queen inside mardi gras cake ! really excellent grill ash tray makes it easy clean , two wheels always better than one . i admit , however this not exactly one touch grill , unless you own personal cooking cyborg touch grill you if you touch its button .. once . that beside point though .. bottom line ? this grill isn't bare bones , but it affordably chique grill-worty funtymes goodness	1

tekquest mosquito catcher sturdy , well built device actually what it claims . after setting up unit according directions , i allowed it run 24 hr mode . ( it also nightime only mode ) i let it run few days checked collection tray . sure enough , remains thousands mosquitos , moth or two , collected . once mosquitos captured , remains begin decomposing process , so there very little left pests . after letting it run 24 hr mode several weeks i switched it night only mode . once sun sets unit turns , runs allnight until sun comes out . so far it worked flawlessly , sitting out our patio become welcomed event again . thank you tekquest	1
my first objective find alarm clock programmable snooze -- this one got it . second objective large enough day-to-day use but also useable travelling -- this one i t.t he projection feature works great me -- it razor sharp even it lowest setting very clear . if you can't see it day time , look he front clock ( which also lit leds pushing any one button ) . yes , buttons not sturdiest , but i believe need use them often negated fact it radio-controlled . you set alarm display preference once you walk away . $20.00 alarm clock , i think it fantastic value	1
this tiny alarm clock really cool . you read manual adjust how big bright you want projection ceiling . you also adjust how loud different patterns you want alarm sound . it tells temperature also . i liked it so much i bought my mom one	1

we really bad bug problem ( inherited trailer when we got it ) - these things work - no bugs my sisters or mothers houses anymore , but we still bugs . we move 2 units around recommended - bugs get use them . also stuff your house absorb noise making them less effective - we wall wall stuff 3 kids tiny trailer . effectively our trailer would take 8 - 10 units . bugs we see easier catch seem disoriented . these buzzers best used wide open spaces minor middling bug problems . spiders beetles moths totally disappered though . our dog hates things when we move one over her bed . so , these units need moved every 2-4 weeks . you need multiple units - 1 every 200 sq . ft . least - if you lots furniture or smaller rooms , then more - they don't work through walls or furniture . you need least one every room you problem . it takes 2 - 3 weeks really start see results . works better if you fewer bugs - really bad bug problem - use conjunction other solutions	1

bounty hunter iv metal detector simple use . owner manual easy follow . we used it beach around our property . we haven't found anything valuable yet , but its fun try	1
low cost metal detector i give this thing five stars . i bought this detector several months back enjoy it relative ease use , it find what you searching ( coins , rings , earings , necklaces , etc ) . other reviews here pretty much wrap it up good ( affordable ! ) unit , but i wanted make few comments amateur point view : - this detector , course , discrimination circuitry used tell difference various metals helping you avoid digging up junk like soda pull tabs which everywhere . it work pretty good , but - i found using tracker iv discriminator , you most likely missing some good stuff . i gone back over " discriminated " areas again " all metal " mode found some nice stuff discriminate didn't catch . granted i am no pro , but fact if you want get every coin , every ring , or every cool item various metals , you may want consider just using " all metal " mode . i almost exclusively use it now although i sift through some absolute junk . i found bunch coins , necklaces , pendants , etc i would otherwise missed . use discriminate mode when looking gold wedding ring your wife through you back yard ... - invest 4 inch " gold nugget coil " which far superior pinpointing metal . stock coil works fine but tad ambiguous precisely where your coin , ring , ( or pull tab ) . smaller coil reduces search time i am glad i one . - i bought recommended bounty hunter headphones ( save battery power ) , but found them bit more trouble than help . when i detect something i squat or sit down dig . i set detector down so coil near dig zone so i waive clumps dirt ( or sand ) front coil i search . problem headphone wire tends always way when i perform this move . i get tired " untangling " so i don't use them anymore . maybe i'm just getting old . - meter no value anyone who hear audible report . it no " range " judge metals you passing over . it simply swings hard right no matter what what i tell . i tried different modes different metals test it , but it seems merely swing hard right you pass over any type metal / alloy . i see how this would still useful deaf person , but it just easily could bright light bulb instead meter . i won't ding this low cost detector though because i'd still dig if it half scale or pegged . - lastly warning . if you go into park , or any area attended kids , you spotted . within short amount time you surrounded kids " helping you " dig up buried treasure . point you decide whether meanie bark them , or write rest hunt off let them shred area every time detector beeps . i generally tell them how it long day " see ya " since they invariably their hands there digging away no matter what you say ...	1

i use this watch business trip all over world , function very nice , compass , temperature , weather forecast functions very useful , especially , baro-chart very important assist judge correct weather forecast . color very nice , but someone mentioned it would discolor , i think it should , but not happen yet , because it always staid very good condition ( only business trip ) , but if i go mountain-climbing , i suppose it might happen soon . then why i not give 5 stars , only disadvantage dual time mode , show local home town time same display very very important during business trip , it tell when i should call back my company , display still enough space display home town time , i think la crosse should consider improve this function . anyway , this still useful watch business trip	-1
so far device entirely lived up expectations . atomic clock feature works fine range accuracy remote sensor seems fair enough -- there often 1-2 degree difference sensor main unit if set right next each other , but this minor uses we get out it ( quick look outside temps during winter ) . only issue we ran into " problematic " ice alarm feature . this feature sets off devices alarm anytime temperature drops 32 27 degrees or so alert you possible icy conditions . problem cold climates temperature hovers range all winter long ... so alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so . we just happened upon solution worked perfectly . ice alarm only works channel 1 . so , if you set outside sensor channel 2 or 3 ice alarm disabled no longer triggered . obviously , they should ability shut it off , but this it ... even this isn't listed instructions	-1

after gilling undersized two-burner char-broil ten years , i decided it time upgrade weber . i used gril now few weeks it best - direct grilling , perfectly searing steaks , grill roasting , even slow barbecuing . if you're looking this grill , you're probably also considering other webers , like genesis silver . go this one . price difference $100 , you get steel flavorizer bars , double layer stainless steel hood , bigger storage area , dual work surfaces . note design : i thought lp tank housed inside cabinet below grill - actually it under right work surface ( not big deal , but hard tell photos ) . only down-side stainless steel cooking grates ( extremely durable , but not best either conducting or retaining heat ) , i prefer cast iron its heat-retention , so i picked up some porcelain-enamaled cast iron grates certain big box orange home improvement store before grill even arrived . cooking this grill heaven . we like barbecue ( low slow , wood chips smoker box ) , this grill handled task wonderfully . my old grill , even low , wood chips would ignite turn ash 15 minutes , giving food nice sooty flavor . this grill , even though it gets very hot very fast , medium wood slowly smoldered just like it supposed . great smokey flavor . we'll doing our thanksgiving turkey it this year ! sure , this grill little pricey , but quality means you won't replace it . long run , great deal high quality product	1
this hinged grate easily allows you put extra charcoal or even move them around while still cooking food . original quite frustrating , you easily could drop your food onto ground while trying access hot charcoals . while one should bought larger grill cooking beyond several people , i'm stuck my 18 incher hinged grill must , i guarantee you can't live without it or you'll always say i should bought one when it too late	1

purchased my first thgr168 remote sensor sept . 06 second sensor feb . 07 . they flawlessly send their signals oregon scientific bar388hga weather station . i've yet replace alkaline batteries either thgr168 . third sensor ( thgr122n ) came weather station set up outdoors using lithium batteries ; it measured down -25 degrees during its first winter . when i first got sensors , i set up all them side side day . units measure temperature ( or ) within tenth point humidity -- if humidity below 40% or above 70% , they also show ' dry ' or ' wet ' unit window . tiny red light flashes each time signal sent . i noticed temperature readings fairly close , within degree or so each other . humidity readings further apart , much 5 percentage points . 3 units , one outside , one attached garage third unit currently kitchen , it nice benefit see temp humidity directly sensor well base station . using wire stand comes units , they easily moved place place . there also wall mount more permanent installation . reception excellent through many four walls two floors ; units within 40 feet base station -- i think oregon scientific claims reception up 100 ft . only outside unit signal occasionally disappears command weather station -- signal navigates 4 walls . move command station slightly different angle info reappears . average or better lighting , read-out easy view . improvement might backlit button see lcd readout dim light . direct sunlight or shade affect readings . these digital units work well . i wouldn't claim them precise instruments but they generally accurate ; nowhere specs orgsci make claim concerning precision	-1

seems quality product , but others already mentioned , instruction booklet seriously lacking . one thing , there no index , nor table contents . i spent hour trying figure out how engage alarms outdoor high temp , etc ., no avail . i guess i am just not hitting right buttons , or leaving them depressed long enough . i able calibrate barometer match my wall-mounted barometer i admit - it works very well . i enjoy too barometric histogram , covering last 36 hours . because booklet doesn't explain , i am still trying figure out what percentage factor " forecast index " really means , why it sometimes presented " 12 hour forecast " , other times it 24 hour forecast . because outdoor sensor not waterproof , it becomes bit challenge locating device where it protected rain , direct sun exposure , etc ., yet out open true reading , so not influenced warmth radiating house . la crosse ought strive waterproof sensor someday	-1
