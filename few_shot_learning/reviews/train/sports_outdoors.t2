i guess you get what you pay . this pedometer difficult calibrate , continued miscount steps , therefore distance , covered . it made plastic , came unclipped easily . i am big person , started walking improve my health . this product not work me , although it might different story slim person . it relegated junk drawer , probably eventually thrown away . i'll find works better purchase it	-1
i gave this pedometer one star because it not anyone who wants use it straight off shelf . this pedometer work if you not mind working it . it problems need modification . top clip this pedometer pushes against body , making vertical angle 20 degrees or more off plumb . means weighted arm inside drags circuit board not move freely . remove factory clip tabs hold it . add some adhesive velchro back case . make fabric band your ankle . attach ends each other velchro . put strip velchro outside band attaching pedometer band . i get accurate readings this pedometer when it attached inside my right ankle . i got inconsistent readings it my waistline . hair spring returns weighted arm its upright position weakened considerably after ten miles pedometer drastically undercounted . i opened pedometer added strut brace spring . strut made thin brass . aluminum soda would work , too . i made " " one end strut hold spring . i pushed lightly against spring left side , drilled hole brass , anchored strut screw lower left part circuit board . strut angles up just slightly screw anchors it . i now quite few miles pedometer . ( i theory spring weakened because its solder joint circuit board may broken slightly allowed spring twist freely . ) several times pedometer reset itself " 0 " no apparent reason . i know nothing pushed reset button . one incident while it going through scanner airport security . once it reset while i walking . twice it reset while i napping sofa . i am thinking charge static electricity overwhelmed circuit , but i not know . static electricity too many synthetic fabrics problem more expensive pedometers , too . this pedometer uses counter circuit . if someone needs inexpensive electronic counter , connect wire weighted arm wire coiled spring it contacts . connect button switch two wires . freeze weighted arm place hot glue	-1
this not fit super 9 rifles far i know . besides , it first off too high zoom also tiny ! ( most scopes whatever zoom x30 . example , i own 3-9x44 scope . this means it adjustable 3 9 times zoom . second number refers size scope lens . i'd seriously reccomend 3x30 if you get one . also make sure it dovetail if its super9 otherwise make sure it weaver rail . if you getting it super 9 not forget unscrew rear sight ( peephole )	1
billy great , full energy enthusiam . i get great results his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results his workout . his customer service rep helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i've doing business amazon many years placed over 150 orders . i never , never once any problems my orders amazon . when i questions , it amazing not only how quick amazon reply but give long thorough kind explanation . because they reply within day take so much time response , it shows they truly care you want give you best service possible . i've never found customer service this very high rare quality . november 2005 , after ordering billy bands official billy bank website . i sent package , without my permission company contained billy energy formula supplements . it 14 day delayed bill 31.85 . i upset this sent without me knowing but here worse part . i contacted customer service , gentleman told me don't worry you haven't billed just send us back package we'll credit you $5 into your account shipping , packaging , mailing cost you pay out your own pocket items sent back . within few days i send product i never requested back . twice phone once email 3 different cust rep i told i would receive $5 credit my bank account within 7 10 days . i already upset this matter but it wasn't big concern . however , 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received $5 credit my account . but there charge taken their company without my permisson or authorization my own personal bank account $8.97 . few days later $8.97 put back into my account . when i contacted company this their reply : thank you your recent e-mail . we apologize inconvenience . our records show your vitamin shipment 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent item i never wanted back 7 days not over 14 day limit ) . this means when charges actually went through , you only charged small portion amount showed invoice ( i kept copy nowhere invoice this stated ) . you received credit shipping handling plus 5.00 dollars ship it back too . this means , when charge vitamins actually went through you only charged 8.97 . this also refund you received , amount paid ( again since item sent back within 14 days i shouldn't charged nowhere invoice this stated i would only charged small portion ) . so basically they sent me product i never requested . told me they would give me some money product sent back . took money my bank account without me knowing paid me back my own money they stolen . sum it up , business amazon !	-1

rechargeable flashlights sensational idea - essential part any family emergency kit ( ecologically smart boot ) . while this product satisfactory , say , science demonsration faraday principle , its usefulness flashlight considerably more limited . its credit : this flashlight meant last , stand extremes water temperature . when dropped into water , it float beam-side up easy retrieval . it so sturdy tha , it likely last lifetime user - you can't say too many products . shake this light while , disk rare earth conducts enough current sustain light small amount time . while you may read claims up one or two hours , faint but workable current only lasts ten minutes , then you shake again . again . long you don't mind repetition , wan stream bluish light serve your purposes blackout or some other emergency . but don't entertain thoughts you'll able read , find small objects , or perform any kind detail work . if you don't chance compare this its better competition , you might not know say , sherpa xray offers well-focused beam you read . while no rechargeable give you kind illumination you'll find traditional flashlight , your options brighter if you stay away diamond gen . invest something more powerful you'll find flashlight usefulness becomes considerably greater . this flashlight disappointing , useless any practical context	-1

all supposed ' resistance ' built into this machine , it enables you many -more- repetitions than you'd able simple bodyweight ' core ' exercises , ( crunches , leg lifts , situps , multitude others ) . why , what effect ? 1/ why : resistance -less- than resistance supplied weight your own body moved around without any equipment . so-called ' resistance ' actually -assists- you return motion , exact opposite exercise . 2/the effect : you must incredibly high number repetitions get any effect all , it won't much even then . high rep work should full-body cardio , not isolated ab work . ab work should same any other muscle-building work : after you 15 reps , resistance should raised : exercising abs , obliques , other core muscles strengthen build them . if exercise doesn't get difficult enough make you stop after minute or so , it simply isn't difficult enough you any good . there no such thing spot reducing exercise . modern ads know better than claim lie spot-reduction , but they still strongly imply it . why they get away it ? : because people never stop looking easy way out . re-sale value these gizmos goes down around 5 bucks soon you own it . why ? : because market flooded as-seen-on-tv , home-exercise junk that collecting dust	-1

i didn't read instructions i also buying dancing partner . this thing just * not * stay still . i tried putting it carpet wood floors , but water weight just isn't enough keep it still . power punching causes base tip then slam back floor making terrible racket . if i lived apartment , my neighbors would hate me . water ends up around 200lbs ( when full ) just doesn't trick . i thinking using sand which tops out around 320lbs , but not sure how easy it get back out since only opening small opening top meant water . springiness , you definitely wail this thing it take it ( moving across floor ) , but my opinion it too springy . there no comparison hitting hanging bag . it definitely needs tension adjustment . i'd say this bag probably better practicing control . i wouldn't suggest this apartment if you plan power-hitting	1

this bobber cooler definitely conversation piece . i so many comments it . i used it when floating down small river near home ( no rapids , just calm water ) , it doesn't hold its weight , literally . first thing opening center cooler , making it impossible get drinks out out pulling whole cooler out water . opening seam rides just barely water , since it round weight shifts little seam dip into water . cooler then fills up water , which almost immediatly melts ice , it fills up it sink bottom . maybe if there rubber gasket seal it better , it might ok . 2 plastic clasps each side used close cooler really easy break off , plus they facing wrong direction . if you bump something like rock or log , it push clasp back then unlatch cooler . this cooler might good use bodys water not current , like pool , but i don't suggest towing it behind anything . i suggest using one many inflateble coolers market	-1

this piece really quite over-priced what you get , though not knife allows you bring this plane you . i've seen this unit marketed elsewhere " travel-friendly " swiss army tool ( not knife ) . nevertheless , unit i 64mb version : asin : b0002vm8zm ... which costs considerably less ( ~ $30 ) amazon , same 128mb usb drive red light unit this page , plus you get small quantity swiss army tools including knife . unless you concerned going plane , i'd recommend asin : b0002vm8zm over unit this page . btw , i got my handy little 64mb unit ( which i'd give four stars if i option ) only $9.99 clearance target .	1
it may say " slow cooker " front item , but i assure you , it anything but slow ! i looking crock pot camping using propane told this item me ! so , i made my hungarian ghoulash it , glad night meal would 8-10 hours when we got back beach . all i say , thank goodness my husband noticed it bubbling inside cooker half hour later , or we wouldn't anything but charcoal left , we left campsite day without checking it ! it cooking low , it literally half hour time . so , keep mind , if you camping you haven't tried using this product yet , it won't take long before your meal . sadly , my crock pot recipes put away rest trip- campground we didn't electricity , hence why i wanted propane crock pot .	-1

( you'd think $100 , you'd get glove every detail medium high quality . ) i cutoff hanging label entirely . third , product description states five distinct layers foam glove your hand point contact . 10 oz glove , it doesn't feel like anything special , just thin layer foam . i'm not impressed padding . overall , glove medium low quality . it even looks cheap . ( leather less than millimeter thick stitching ordinary . ) i'll use glove i've already spent money , but my next glove i think going title platinum . unfortunately , everlast seems gone way cheap mass production net profit sacrifice it reputation	1

i am surprised this bike gotten good reviews ; i am quite diappointed . i purchased this bike after looking many mountain bikes decided this seemed good buy . however , it turned out not so . first all , bike really ugly its white brownish colors , though i suppose that personal issue . performance , this bike not worth its stated price over $200 , so don't think you getting some great deal . suspension leaves something desired it seems shifting funny . i am not expert bikes , but i'm pretty sure shifting supposed little smoother than this . also , after week , i noticed strange noise coming bike i peddled . it hard explain ... almost like something out place . so again , bike not worth this price . perhaps if it sold around $100 it would decent deal	-1

i two these units ( sg2 sg4 ) all i say " don't believe hype " . while units unbelievable concept tv work ( note : when they work ) great , lack computer knowledge unbelievably awful customer service provided skygolf , itself , sufficient reason choose product this arena . just relay my experience ( keep mind i 15 years high technology industry leverage open when attempting set-up these units ) , it took almost six hours phone set-up my original sg2 even then it constantly destabilizing my system software ( ie-endless restarts ) . when sg2 stolen event , i purchased sg4 obtain next generation product . since january 2 , 2007 , purchase date , i phone no less than eight customer service representatives total amount time approaching ten hours ( including one saturday morning , prior sunday event , when they requested i attend conference call regarding my unit 5am ( no , not typing error my part ! ) california time ) . i purchased/received ( skygolf sent me one unit their headquarters out desperation ) returned three sg4s various points process ensure units not damaged . i attempted download software access website via sg4 five different computers every single service pack microsoft windows 2000 . even after i forwarded skygolf computer log show them problem ( software error ) neither software developers nor customer service department could figure out what wrong units never operational . this point , all i say what complete utter waste time this process how frustrating ( echo review ) it deal people behind product . no product , no matter how fabulous concept , worth this level incompetence during set-up operation . good luck you if you purchase product . i hope your experience better than mine .	-1

********** update - old review ( see below ) dixiekip . only reason it still two stars because i can't figure out how change it . old vegas chips nothing but helpful this matter even though i didn't actually order cards them . i would order them any day week now just based their customer service issue wasn't even theirs . my apologies old vegas chips this matter . i highly recommend them if anyone knows how change stars , please let me know . if you interested these cards , go old vegas chips , not some other dealer !!!! - jim ****************** i ordered these particular plastic cards because my opinion , they much cooler than paisley ones also offered . i immediately ordered them , yet when my package arrived yesterday ( timely manner , i give them ) i opened find ugly paisley cards looking me face . i not yet contacted seller see what options i , but this going leave me either two options , 1 ) return them wait longer them or 2)suck it up get stuck ugly cards . i repost once i spoken them	1
i regret buying this gun . it broke within four days buying it . we just enough shooting adjust hop-up(for accuracy ) , it fired great . it really accurate . gun made really cheap plastic , trigger stopped working . right now , we're waiting rma it . i would recommend paying little extra , buy more durable gun . i bought gun cost $55 , one made much better plastic feels much more durable	-1

i rated 2 stars because joint kid bike parent bike too lose child almost falling off bike . i also contact company who made this product they told me they send part make child bike straight , but i never recived part . i am very disappointment because safety my kid first they didn't help me . i hope some future purchase company assist me my needs . thank you	1
my complaints this stand : 1 . far worst thing this stand it leans too far forward . there not enough counter-weight so slight pull bike cause thing tip . if it wasn't this , i might say , " well i guess it alright 79 dollars . " 2 . clamp isn't strong enough hold bike securely . if you clamp seat-post example it rotate seat-post . 3 . thing tightens clamp made plastic . i'm assuming it break fairly quickly . 4 . rotator made plastic - i haven't tried rotating seat post where it would put any weight rotator , but i doubt it hold it . my opinion this product should not sold . if you just want clean your bike stand , it fine , but anything requires any force like taking pedals or crank arms off , forget-about-it	1

when it windy , top canopy like this needs removed prevent wind damage . no information available how long it takes this . i called d.c. america they say they only distributors buy it overseas no idea no manuals available online me look . they said it takes few hours assemble or disassemble . one retailer i spoke , fogdog , guesses it would need disassembled remove top , but he admitted they not tried assembling it . so it appears what these two sources said every time wind storm comes up , it would require half-a-day disassemble it then reassemble it - not something i care . there any owners out there answer this question ? frame left up only top covering removed ? if so , how long would it take remove top covering ? it easy ? it nice looking unit , but unfortunately sellers cannot answer most basic question item like this . thanks .	1

after 350 miles moderate usage ( 6.5 mph average fairly low resistance 40 minutes daily ) piece metal snapped one arms , rendering trainer inoperable . unfortunately this considered " wear item " not warrantied manufacturer since elliptical used * very * lightly ( perhaps 20 miles max ) during first year purchase ( warranty period ) . i put majority mileage machine over past four months , while it great burning calories , i never really felt it " quality " piece equipment . it appears manufacturer knows what parts frame likely break first conveniently labels these " wear items " , thus making repair expensive difficult ... this spite fact piece broke non-moving , load-bearing support piece . seems little fishy me . throughout life machine i constantly tightening bolts fix popping banging sounds occurred after moderate use , observed wheels would often attempt jump out tracks heavier use . after 70 miles i noted wheels leaving large greyish streaks tracks where they wearing down against imperfections track surface . i believe this also partly due too much " play " interaction wheels tracks , allowing wheels jump tracks little which each revolution . this machine not feel very sturdy , throughout last month its very short life , gave me creepy sense impending doom whenever i used it ... somehow i knew it break , unfortunately , it . my hunch real enough i began shopping replacement several weeks ago . please shop around ... i would not recommend this machine people looking moderate high intensity workout , but it may fine slower walking or jogging paced routines place less stress machine mechanical components . if you infrequent user this model may ok , but if you plan using it every day i would recommend you keep looking . note my machine 428p which , time purchase , differed 418 primarily computer heart rate monitoring . frame identical 418 428p , which appears no longer sold . since problems my machine directly related body construction , they appropriate review 418 . unless manufacturer made major improvements problems i experienced likely still occur . visual inspection pictures here leads me believe no major changes made frame construction	1

just a/b comparison sx800r ( 16 mile range)and midland gxt-450 ( 10 or 12 mile range ) . neither radio came anywhere near effective range advertised . midland lost communcation after 1/2 mile apart woods . i then tried both radios flat open road . 2.9 miles apart , neither radio could pick up it counterpart . it wasn't until we hit 1.8 mile mark motorola picked up some static other motorola . still nothing midland . approx 1.5 miles apart , motorola worked fine . i gave up midland . reason i not give motorola 1 star rating because i like weather band feature . bottom line , unless you airplane no obstructions all or curvature earth worry , forget getting anywhere near advertised range . good rule thumb , if you see other person , then you range .	1
i attracted thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints night wear , because thermoskin advertised it could worn while sitting during day . product indeed clever-seeming design , it well manufactured . but ultimately , this product seems me too floppy unstable consistently stretch out area foot feels me like it needs stretched . ( i.e. , area sole my foot i feel stretching out mornings when , before getting out bed while sitting up it , i press my toes hard against looped cord or towel ; stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out bed . ) velcro fastenings indeed secure , but product sock-like sleeve ankle cuff move around some even when straps cinched down tight they'll go ; result , what feels like appropriate stretch typically disappears five or ten minutes normal movement friction bed while lying down . worse , angle created pulling strap up through buckle front lower leg just doesn't create proper stretch ; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy . i'm going try rigid split , which may less comfortable . but i believe i need strapped into something consistently maintains proper angle , which thermoskin product doesn't . i'd rather incur some discomfort , if it actually help me get well , than continue use this not too uncomfortable ( but ineffective ) product thermoskin . perhaps others or better results it than i ; i no medical training nor deep insight into anatomy or physiology beyond what i've read internet , so consider this very much layman review . i've suffering plantar faciitis now four five months little improvement , i can't compare this product others i hope might more effective . but i very disappointed this product , regret spent money it	1

i purchased two these , one each my sons . i received them quickly packaging good shape . when we took first one out tightened handlebars so get it ready charge ride everything seemed ok . but wires where you plug charger into 4 wheeler tightened so place you turned key change speeds . got it charging , we think . then we start second one . we take it out charger half melted . ok , not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use charger other one since they same . well , when we plugged charger second four wheeler after 1 hour we went back out garage where it charging charger we using come first four wheeler started melt ! nevermind house could caught fire ! so apparently someone plugged original charger already happened , rather than someone just packaged defective charger . nice someone pack it back up send it me used defective . first four wheeler turned ran ok few minutes so it must charged , we went ahead plugged it up instructions said - if we received it brand new like we thought we . when it used first time it ran little over hour , only light popping out front every little bump . light didn't work . while trying re-attach light we found several places needed tightened up . we can't re-charge it though because only good charger two melted . when we first took these out boxes they small ( big enough 3 or 4 year old ) but they looked pretty sturdy , much better than plastic ones you get walmart , i paid close same amount . they difficult get out packaging , because there metal frame box needed taken apart , but should good , protect during shipping . however when you think how you going get them back metal frame box shipping send them back so someone possibly see how bad whole mess you start get cranky tired . i admit i haven't tried return them . i am quite worried it much trouble these things already . i am tempted though , because i would like let people know this type problem before they waste their money . imagine how dissapointed i right before christmas i couldn't give kids two their bigger gifts because they junk . i am very upset . so now several hundred dollars ( times two ) could bought very nice christmas presents just flushed down drain .	-1

overall steel frame structure it good , but there too many flaws this product , i recommend going something else . flaws : 1 ) bands not give you good increments resistence . if you want even resistance each side , you go 20 lbs 40lbs one setting , which crazy . 2 ) workout assembly manuals terrible . especially workout manual - what use machine if correct use it not demonstrated ? what really say how much stamina cares people using it correctly , without injury , getting good benefit out it ? only 10 exercises really shown , rest just single pictures let you vaguely guess what you supposed , except many some other machine , not this one . i'm sure someone get injured incorrect use . 3 ) many pictures misleading , such you can't actually many exercises suggested or inferred pictures . one customer service person told me pictures some prototype machine . ridiculous . 4 ) several construction pieces i received bad caused problems , but replacement parts shipped no problem , albeit it meant waiting week or so each one , then time reconstruct machine . i replace main rail main leg support frame piece because they both welded wrong . 5 ) leg padding inadequate painful6 ) doesn't seem product understood or cared stamina , no one i called seems use it or really tell you it . company claims care health fitness , they really don't show it this product or support this product . i'd go elsewhere .	-1
real colorful flashy bike , however there several things wrong it . 1 . tires so much excess rubber , it trimmed or else it rubbed . 2 . back wheel completely removed loosen bearings . if not , bike would basically come stop itself . 3 . main ( front ) sprocket slightly bent , so chain falls off constantly . 4 . bike if very heavy . maybe makes it sturdy , but it also makes it tough 4 year old ride . i should just bought bike off floor wal-mart or target half price	1

we past owned step single jogger . it wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs . it always needed tipped back change direction it rusted little because we left it outside . if we stayed only child family it would continued working but addition baby we decided sell it . after transition over year now weather warming up we decided get double jogger strolling . we purchased step run around ltd 2 jogging stroller hopes it would meet our new needs . problems single stroller seemed compounded double stroller . my husband no problem getting it together but complained cheap caliper style break ... it doesn't stop stroller barely even slows it down . it took him same amount time work break it took him assemble whole jogger . after we placed our three year old our 18 month old it test ride . when placing them we encountered our next problem ... seats even highest point super reclined . they wanted no part laying back but instead both utterly thrilled sit far forward mess each other . straps six inch long safety label sewn webbing made it almost impossible thread them through front buckle . so off we set our test drive . it really hard push almost impossible turn . after while we figured out letting kids sit so far forward threw off balance whole jogger . only way make it partially work let out both seats fully reclined position , criss-cross shoulder straps constantly yell " stay down kids ... if you sit up one more time i'm going sit it make you push me ! " well we got home our test run my husband pulled out cardboard box resigned air began job taking it apart . i don't recommend this item . all honesty our radio flyer pathfinder wagon job more effectivel	-1

let me start saying this wonderful product . small , light , well constructed ( they feel like they last forever ) . you carry them you , allowing workout your fingers office , home or wherever you find suitable . i bought four different color-coded gripmasters : black/heavy , red/medium , blue/light , yellow/extra light . i only found resistance red black ones useful me , but my wife loves blue yellow ones . it great buy because their high quality affordable price . product comes foldable instruction booklet where you find details six different exercises : - trigger pinch . this one simulates movement squeezing trigger , it isolates index finger enhanced strength coordination . - gross grasp . this one strengthens fingers , thumb , wrist forearm firm grip . - hook position . this one strengthens longer muscles forearm wrist while stretching smaller muscles hand greater motion endurance . - tip tip pinch . this exercise strengthens specific fingers , thumb , smaller hand muscles forearm greater control endurance . - wrist flexion . it strengthens wrist forearm muscles . - key pinch . strengthens thumb index finger greater stability coordination . gripmaster website you find more exercises different activities sports . if you looking crush hands when handshaking this not product you , but if you need finger strength , control , endurance coordination you right place	1

i write lot reviews books , but seldom write one product . however ; i feel like breaking my trend reviewing this lite . i , like i suppose , just everyone else , keep looking lite right all people , all purposes . if it exists , i haven't seen it ye t.t he plain ordinary battery flashlight remained essentially same since i got my first kid , 60 years ago . they often fail you when they needed , batteries expensive , but overall they serve purpose . 50 years ago , hand held magneto lite appeared . long you kept squeezing it , it gave light comparable normal flashlght . it similar lite sold use bicycle , where it powered turning wheel . however ; soon bicycle stopped , light went out . some reason , they disappeared off market . few years ago , new almost similar magneto lite appeared . biggest difference , it made lot noise when squeezed . they don't appear very popular . this faraday principle lite made very popular due tv ads , more because what they don't say than what they say , many people disappointed upon getting one . ad flouts idea it seen up mile . sowhat !, we learned military , lit cigarette seen hundreds yards away night . so , if that not you looking , it meaningless you . fact , it very poor casting light suface more than few feet away . this purpose , it can't begin compete normal flashlight ; if that what you want , forget it . matter fact , those little led keychain lites just much ; picked up buck " dollar stores " . they last couple years , weigh next nothing , you'll always one you . i leave them around house they handy look something dark spot , or occasional time you need find circuit breaker panel or find your way power failure . these lites so weak you can't assume they meet your expectations store , or watching tv ad . my advice try compare key chain lite , one might serve you well other , huge difference cost .	1
this gamble since it isn't cheap results promised no different any other supplement ad campaign . i only tried muscle milk because i read up it after seeing it endorsed nfl athelete during espn interview . i started using it 2 months ago consistant servings daily . two months later my strength increased , my mass increased my body fat noticeably diminished . my workout routine diet always same before starting mm but results since using mm made impact , there nothing else i attribute it . fact it also tastes great nice bonus but given definite results mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid . not fool yourself , it loaded fat . it relies you workout steadily maintian clean diet you realize it true benefit . you not get sculpted using mm without commitment , you only get fatter . but if you committed use mm suggested it most certainly produce change your appearance .	1
i don't actually own one yet , but my boyfriend so i've sneaking over his house use it until i make room my own home one . when i first used it i like some other reveiwers , disappointed it didn't work my abs way i expected , but then i realized i wasn't doing it correctly . it makes it pretty easy use your legs arms instead just your abs so it helps focus beginning just using your abs nothing else then you really feel it ! strap way too small though , i usually just put my fingers under it , but there no way somme things lady video , like sticking your arms through strap holding them straight ... i pretty small arms . range motion thing great , feels so good back , which complete opposite doing crunches ground(i used 1,000 crunches day but then i started getting bruises my back them i pretty much hit plateau where i wasn't seeing any changes my abs ) . i so much fun using ab lounge while i watch tv too , it great way make commercial time go . i would recommend people problems this try go slowly really focus working just your abs , it makes it so much more worth it	1
two years ago , i tore one transverse ligaments my wrist playing racquetball , which unfortunate combination dusty court , 200 pounds player moving 15 miles hour , poorly timed forehand very hard wall . i two surgeries repair injury , it mostly successful . biggest side effect weakness my injured wrist hand . i moved beyond squeezing toys putty , but i lacked strength weight training . this device tremendous breakthrough me . i able make some rapid gains my strength without risking injury weights . i am already seeing difference just two weeks . if you recovering surgery such carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries , i strongly recommend making this device part your recovery plan . course , check your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up new exercise	1
i originally bought blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters my 14 year old boys . blue little too easy gripping but excellent exercising ring little finger . blue too easy them so they not use it so i ended inherited it . it pretty habit forming fun use because tension light , this makes it good use anytime , anywhere . ( i used it stuck traffic it also good stress reliever ) if i it again , i would probably not bought this tension unless you very light grip , probably started red . just remember this mainly fingers hand exercise so very easy use gripping , challenge working out fingers . it not like using regular heavy hand grippers . it increased my hand strength grip just it me using it during course day without planned workouts . great product , excellent finger or hand exercise , good quality	1
i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

we got this bike our 4 year old , it sturdy rugged enough last next few years . assembly instructions looked intimidating first , but since many pieces already pre-assembled you skip most them . it lot easier than anticipated . only reason why i gave it 4 stars : it deep scratch/paint chip frame . but since i got this during sale great price considering it needed next day we kept it anyway	1
cord-wrapped handle great idea , offering more real sword-like look well firmer grip . my hands tend get sweaty slip around bit long practice , particularly sealed lacquered finish most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed touch glue get it stay place ) . two-piece guard design nice enhancement too . though you really don't need guard all many applications it nice looking appears stronger than original . it still fairly cheap piece wood , compared ironwood version , but this price ( it $9.99 when i bought it ) you really can't go wrong . nice enhancement over basic bokken . i , however , prefer natural wood version this one it looks pretty bad once you start using it color scrapes off . nevertheless , if you want inexpensive practice sword this one recommended ...	1

this bag much better than normal bop bags far rebound action . old style falls all down ground then slowly comes back standing position . this one much more like real bag snapping back not hitting ground unless you hit it hard coarse . my kid 4 5 years only use bag supervised taught proper punching/elbow/knee kicking strikes ! i would never leave this bag alone them thrash , it would break real quick h20 base , not good . great young kids learn ....

i found myself staggered sticker shock while shopping decent pair mtb glove , 30-40 dollars . no offense makers these woefully overpriced digit protectors , but please ! i some research web , harbinger gloves received good reviews couple different sources . price fourth competitors , so i thought why not try them out . gloves great , i very pleased their performance . not only they cool look factor , but they also well made . there decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into meaty areas palm , where you would expect need it . additionally , velcro connection comes little higher wrist , full palm protection , which i like . nice touch tough material used palm around thumb fingers . it serves dual purposes protection grip . it definitely tough handled some hard , hands first , touch downs . downside , i know i might get sweaty hands this summer(live sw desert ) because palm area all plastic verses leather . yet , this fair trade protection rugged construction . if you dont want spend 40 bucks gloves , dont need gel cushion these best bang buck	1
let me just start this review out making it clear i am huge basketball/nba/wnba/cba fan . i picked up this basketball started dribbling it . i amazed two things . first all , it bounces really high you very rarely keep pumping it up like you some other basketballs . you use it both outside/indoors although it geared more indoors then outdoors . second all , grip basketball very good , so it won't slip out your hands . this only basketball i actually owned doesn't slip out my hands . wrap things up , i end my review making it clear you should go spalding buy this basketball	1

bad news first : extension cables very stiff , they're shipped tight loop . don't expect them straighten out easily . they don't come extra clips attach them foot straps . i just swap cables whichever bowflex station i'm not using get much better feel . ball ... ball . it job . little pump they supply it isn't great , but it also job . maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up ball . ;-) there no check valve ball , so prepared get pump out plug fast , once it fully inflated . mat looks bit cheap , but it comfortable it keep you sliding around . video decent . even if you already know what you're doing , it worth watching see how moves using bowflex . so far , i wouldn't say you've even come close justifying purchase price . but those foot straps just brilliant ! once you've gotten them adjusted , they'll go off no problem , making it easy add stretches regular workout without losing your momentum . but once you them secured they won't come off , or even shift much , when you're performing exercises . may sound like no big deal , but i've used straps took forever put wandered all over place while doing movements . four points cable attachment well-placed solid . i've doing resistance stretches long time , these best straps i've ever used . they're worth price admission	1

this first cathe strength workout i've tried , i found it intense challenging without gruelling . however , keep mind this advanced workout , so intermediates like myself probably need lift less weight than cathe ( i generally used 1/2 2/3 what cathe using ) order complete workout . cathe uses variety equipment this workout , including barbell , several sets dumbbells , full club step , toning band , but i able get without barbell , step , or band ( although my modifications may further lowered intensity workout ) . main workout muscle max 68 minutes long , but dvd also offers several premixes : upper body only ( 42 minutes ) , upper body push-pull ( 33 minutes ) , lower body only ( 23 minutes ) , timesaver ( 56 minutes ) . full workout breaks down follows : warm-up , lower body , chest , back , lower body , shoulders , bicep , tricpes , core stretch ( dvd includes subchapters under each above categories ; see cathe web site full list exercises plus video clip ) . during warm-up , you constantly moving rather than performing static stretches , but i liked cathe still managed thoroughly stretch each muscle group going worked . also , cathe constantly varies count , which adds interest well varying intensity each movement . thing i liked this workout cathe allows plenty time exercises , thereby providing you opportunity rest change your weights needed . i also enjoyed upbeat music , some it vocal . overall , this routine left me feeling completely worked out , yet not exhausted , which means it enjoyable little dread factor . i think both advanced exercisers intermediates who modify get great workout this video -- highly recommended	1

i love this ab wheel , but some reviews here ridiculous , like when woman claims it burned off 20 pounds month . that 72,000 calories , or 2400 calories day . put perspective , you'd run 24 miles day , every day , take off 20 pounds month just through exercise . let say you use this devise 3 minutes before you tire out . heck , give it benefit doubt say 5 minutes . means it might burn off 50 calories day . if you every day ( unlikely , because your abs would want some rest ) , you could burn off just under half pound month . that based some pretty optimistic assumptions . so it not weight loss device . but it great ab strengthener , better than anything else i've use . it'll tighten up your stomach like crazy , long you some cardio burn keep fat off , you'll end up great , flat , ripped up stomach .	1
good : * i couldn't find these bricks-and-mortar stores all , it relief purchase them affordably through vendor i trust . * 1-lb weight inserts make it easy adjust weight , cuff or off . * i using them two weeks , effect my workout - my legs - tremendous . bad : * cuffs " adjustable " two long velcro straps wrap all way around ankle . no matter how carefully i wrap them , i just can't get them tight i'd like . straps which wrap double back through d-rings would much more useful . * cuffs tend ride down dig into tops my feet . cushioned gel or not , i can't exactly call " comfortable . " i'm not sure whether this specific this brand , or typical ankle weight cuffs . overall : i wish i'd able try these some other brands before i purchased them . however , i'm delighted found them results i'm seeing	1

msr pocket rocket great little cooker . best going light fast . perfect shared stove among two people , even better simple boiling or melting snow drinking water . i would suggest this stove use maximum pot capacity two liters , more than this it becomes little unstable . if your menu simple you live instant meals require only boiling water this stove you . because this stove designed minimalist , it tiny very concentrated hot spot , so if you backcountry gourmet want cook pancakes eggs you might better off stove larger flame spread . again , great boiling water melting snow , but not actual cooking	1

reviewer said : i think this product needs few improvements , but all it strong value proposition . here what i would improve if i charge : 1 . higher resolution screen so gui could present more information . 2 . macintosh compatibility . 3 . pc cable should included . it stands , cable pc software costs nearly much device itself . i say : far higher resolution goes , i wouldn't want print any smaller , especially if you deal direct sunlight otherwise you would hard pressed see readout . concerning issue 2 3 i no comment because i not purchase software . however concerning unit itself , i noted following improvements which allow me grade this product 5 stars . noted suggestions modification ecaddy . 1 . clip should remain , however ecaddy should attached clip via strong pull cord . this allow quick easy interaction ecaddy .

i bought red ge lantern couple years ago . i used it power outages , walking my dogs morning night during winter , rarely , i've even used it camping . i haven't any definitive studies but battery life seems longer than 16 hours ge states . i find light strong enough read . during dog walks lantern all but submerged rain it hasn't phased it . it performance not affected colder temperatures even down teens . though i admit , neither dogs , or i wanted out very long weather cold . workmanship very nice . i recently looked coleman lanterns they gone flimsy plastic top . ge lantern built very sturdily but light enough carry one hand still control leashed dog . only downside i've found , i don't consider this big issue , if lantern knocked hard enough , say you slip fall down ravine rain , batteries slip out place somewhat light either dim or go out . it easy fix , just transfer both dog leashes one hand , turn lantern upside down , unscrew base enough so batteries settled back where they belong tighten base back up . i would definitely purchase ge lantern .	1

first off , those you calling it " clip " should know clip nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched or built into gun itself . please call it magazine ( actual name it ) full metal jacket isnt full magazine amunition its bullet full metal casing like say 3 0-0 6 round . second , dont complain scope because it decorative instrument . you buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you hardcore then get real gun . this gun good shooting your little cousin far away . its great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant used abused like ww2 garand or bar . it plastic , it shoots things . i'm probably reinstating most what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance . so yeah get this gun if airsoft hobby you . not sport . i also suggest getting . 20g bbs maybe speedloader or 2 cause mags so expensive this gun pours ammo like water . fu n.p.s. though they may noth trigger finger ability , spring airsoft guns tendency more accurate fire harder heavier bb . if you playin friends i suggest getting $30 dollar rifle 250-300 fps ( shoots like 300-350	1

this review focus specs since there minimal information available unless you buy bike . first off , this my second mongoose . i started out crappy low end cruiser model , so anything even half step up model vast improvement . theory weighs 38 lbs actually light grey color despite image this website . i thought i getting white bike , i'm little ticked it actually grey , but , whateva . assembly isn't too bad long you half clue what you're doing . documentation adequate , but don't expect able assemble this bike correctly if you haven't it before . documentation frustrate you . but average person probably install pedals saddle , maybe even mount handlbars correctly assuming brakes don't arrive screwed up like mine . front cable relocated because when it assembled plant , it threaded immediately under fork tire rubbing against it so it removed resituated , which entailed messing front cable . simple enough , i suppose , but this assumes you know what you're doing . i couldn't install front tire correctly because disc brake , , wanting safe instead stupid , i took bike lbs them install it . it then i found out one disc pads missing . no problem . i just went back home found it box . apparently it become dislodged housing front tire during transit . i didn't even know it there because i haven't worked disc pads before . it good thing i didn't toss box right away otherwise i would sol . just advised , however , if you missing one or both disc pads toss out box before you realize one pads missing , depending where you , you may or may not able find replacement pads . you may end up upgrade better brand disc brake . now onto specs . front disc brake promax brand , dsk-400 , which world mtn biking , generic low end . i some digging around web find following site because you won't find " [ ... ] " website . it wasn't really all much more helpful not help me understand disc brakes any better , but least you'll better idea what look . documentation site color images vs black white images come enclosed bike . go here instead : [ ... ] i wouldn't call promax disc brake crap , but , close enough . note : if you plan doing any kind semi-serious mtn biking , trail considered " intermediate " level , then upgrade disc brakes . if you're planning real mtn biking trip rocks logs whole nine , then theory probably handle it , just don't expect miracles . gears , there 21 shimano flavored they work flawlessly . they're pleasure because there isn't usual slipping dragging you see lower end mongoose mtn bikes . only problem i upper gears don't seem want shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say , 2 , then upshift 3 , example , so forth others . if you want 6 , then go 5 , then upshift vice versa . this may or may not because cogs need lubed . ride , theory dual-suspension bike you really feel difference vs hard-tail bike . wow . just riding street going over speed bumps rain gulleys amazing . you very little no shock all because suspension absorbs it . overall , this bike good bang buck , but i wouldn't pay over $300.00 tops it . if you're going go high , you get something else higher end parts . oh , one last thing . if you value your reproductive organs , don't want find yourself numb package exit and/or sitting bag frozen peas week after using bike , then yourself favor switch out saddle . one comes theory horrible . get thicker padded , gel lined , split saddle instead .	1

friend who successful competition mountain bike rider asked me weigh blackburn airfix after i bought it . he many occasions where his chain broken , or his tires punctured , so he wanted compare weight blackburn versus weight all individual tools he carried when he rides . airfix weighed 245 grams - 8 ounces - his tools , including inflator , tire levers , hex wrenches chain tool ( all included airfix ) tipped scales 337 grams - 11 ounces . i suppose multitool may not convenient use individual tools , but handiness , this seems hard beat . blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee also very attractive . so while i yet put this tool into action either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 , world where every ounce weight heavy concern , pardon pun , i imagine i made wise purchase	1
i really like this bike . it feels like bike ' 50s but all modern technology . look great draws lot attention . it somewhat simple complete bike since it arrives mostly put together but assembly instructions worst i ever seen any product . i basically got no clue instructions how finish off bike , it hard believe how poorly they written . i beginning believe they sent me wrong directions . after i got it together through trial error brakes shifter way out whack i spend $30 local bike shop get these items adjusted ; instructions making adjustment not work . guys bike shop took two attempts get it right ( two trips me ) they wondering why it so difficult adjust . after all i love bike it rides nicely when properly adjusted , shifts brakes very nicely . ride comfortable i love seat location handlebars . i would recommend bike all fun looks it but prepared some hassle get it right unless you one lucky ones who gets one adjusted correctly out box . my suggestion manufacture this bike fire idiot who wrote assembly instructions hire someone some writing skills . i also not understand why brakes shifter so far out adjustment ; no one test bike before they boxed it up	1

two most respected bodybuilding supplements ( 1)whey protein ( 2)creatine . they also considered natural products or food products . while whey without doubt extremely useful , creatine not help everybody . i used creatine monohydrate past i found it useless . it so utterly ineffective i just felt robbed my hard earned money . my tub still sits cupboard . i never used any other supplement products other than ones seem safe side these both . i heard no-xplode some bodybuilders who seemed think it probably one best supplement products come out years . i researched it it appears bsn formulated surging " creatine + nitric oxide " drink seems work most people . not everybody sees results but this stuff worked me what counts . although no-xplode contains some serious chemistry ( see below ) possibly some debatable compounds ( guanidino propionic acid [ gpa ] glycocamine ) it probably well worth very low-level risks results . 40 minutes after taking this stuff i either cardio high intensity 30 min flat ( maybe even more ) complete full range compound weight lifts gym without feeling any interruption my power . no fatigue . surge exactly it promises . you feel you nitro pumping around your body . it sets 20 minutes me . i feel little woozy first , disorientated , then my brain picks up my body feels energetic . put it into action you see results . it also boats cem3 type creatine prevents you bloating up like monohydrate . i never stepped much outside what considered safe but my opinion no-xplode standing fence saying i am best bang your buck without any serious side effects . so far this stuff getting very good feedback . yes it contains lots mind boggling ingredients , but if you looking creatine edge , even if creatine never worked you before , then no-xplode probably one . it also help build muscle , but even if it doesn't you , it still worth it surge . i am very glad i got it . very . serving size : 1 scoop ( 20.5 g)servings per container : 40amount per serving : calories : 36-calories fat : 0total fat : 0g-saturated fat : 0gcholesterol : 0mgsodium : 150mgpotassium : 75mgtotal carbohydrates : 9g-sugars : 0gprotein : 0gvitamin b6 : 25mg-(pyridoxine hcl)vitamin b12 : 120mcg-(cyanocobalamine)folic acid : 400mcgmagnesium : 360mgphosphorus : 500mgcalcium : 75mgno-xplode proprietary blend : 20,500 mg(no-xplode contains patent pending nutrient suspension matrix efforsorb delivery system)no meta-fusion ( patent pending)(l-arginine akg , citral-m ( citrulline malate ) , l-citrulline akg , l-histidine akg , rc-nos ( rutacarpine 95%) , gynostemma pentaphyllum ( 95% gypenosides ) , nad ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)muscle volumizing creatine matrix ( patent pending)cem3 ( creatine ethyl ester malate ) , 2cm ( dicreatine malate ) , betapure ( trimethylglycine ) , glycovol ( glycocyamine ) , guanipro ( guanidino proplonic acid ) , cinnulin pf ( aqueous cinnamon extract ) , keto-isocaproate potassiumener-tropic xplosion ( patent pending)l-tyrosine , taurine , endurlac ( glucuronolactone ) , l-tyrosine akg , methylxanthines ( caffeine ) , mct ( medium chain triglycerides ) , vinpocetine 99% , vincamine 99% , vinburnine 99%phospho-electrolyte replacercalcium phosphate , magnesium oxide , potassium phosphate , sodium phosphateglycerol hydrating polymerspotassium glycerophosphate , magnesium glycerophosphate , glycerola stearat	1

i bought this croquet set late last summer backyard ge t-t ogethers neighbors . none us played before , so we didn't need top-of-the-line , price right this set . it everything it needs : weighty , colorful , compact its case . widgets pretty bendy , but if they bend out shape , they bend right back . turned out good investment . word warning if you small dogs : put them house before you let your neighbors loose mallets round projectiles . my little dachshund picked up bad habit chasing balls pushing them further off-course . it funny , until she darted into path one bright orange ball , which made solid contact her little head . ( she fine now , but no longer fan game . ) all all , i would highly recommend set like this around if you room your backyard fun neighbors	1
i didn't know what expect , but these turned out very good quality . they stretch well return shape . they don't feel like they going snap apart when you middle exercising . i very pleased product . careful , though , if you latex allergy . i also got excellent service company ! i would definitely business them again	1
there not lot information out there using this extractor cars , because i think most people buy it boats instead . so i'm going talk how well it works changing oil your car . summary , it works great . it really nice able change your oil your own time your own home without getting dirty . i'm never going jiffy lube again . it even works great my lawnmower . using extractor very easy . just remove your dipstick , insert extractor tube into dipstick hole until end reaches bottom oil pan ( it might take some practice get feel this part ) . once everything place , pump 10-20 times . this cause extractor suck out oil like straw . it takes 15 minutes 3 quarts . that also why i recommend 6-liter model instead 2.5 -liter one , so you suck out all oil one shot . some people wonder whether all oil removed this way . unfortunately , i can't really speak , because would require me open drain plug investigate . however , consensus stuff i've read internet extractor remove much oil traditional method . because changing my oil so easy extractor , i always change my oil time . previously , i drove thousands miles past my " due date " because stopping oil change too inconvenient . extractor should used after engine running . oil less viscous contaminants stirred up , making extractor more effective . also , please remember your old oil must properly recycled . most mechanic shops accept your old oil ( i put it plastic orange juice container ) , just call ahead make sure	1

this great bike . i gave one my 2 and4 year old share christmas . it winter here so they ride it through house all time . my son really struggled 2 wheel bikes because typical bike easily crashes when you turn handle bars too hard . this bike made so turning radius very small . bike light enough he just picks it up little make big turn . no problem . he goes sailing through house now no crashing . once weather good enough go outside he going ball . he definately graduate standard bike after this teaches him balance . he should able skip obnoxious training wheels altogether . my short 2 year old loves it but she go slowly because she barely reach floor . few months she should fine i'm guessing this summer she'll sailing it . great fun . unfortunately price very hard swallow . i found one sale through design website so i could manage it . if money won't bankrupt your budget or you save it , it worth it	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need i t.t he barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wris t.t he compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	1

i purchased this knife $4 cheaper than its usual amazon listing price amazon friday sale . i looking kershaw knives awhile , following incident my building parking garage ( woman accosted , pocketbook stolen ) , it seemed like perfect time buy . " rainbow " titanium-coating color might bother some men , but i'm woman , so i don't mind color knife . i would preferred black-on-black , but this too good deal pass up . safety lock looks like it might slip out safety easily , but two weeks time regular wear/use , i haven't problem . i flip knife open often ( heck , it fun ) , i wear it regularly ( what point it , if you're not prepared use it ? ) . thin attached metal " belt clip " very sturdy multipurpose ( it looks similar metal clip writing pen ) . not only i clip kninfe just inside my slacks waistband , but it clips easily inside leather pocket my purse . single finger flip-open mechanism beyond belief - very easy use , exceptionally fast accurate . locking mechanism ( keeps blade place ) extremely solid , worked without flaw . when i'm walking anyplace suspicious myself , i hold knife " ready flip open " position my hand , held down my side . knife nearly invisible position , so i don't stand out " oh my god , she carrying knife ! " however , someone intent criminal act just might notice , avoid me altogether . great knife personal safety . lastly , like other reviews point out , these knives sharp . i don't use mine open letters , boxes typical pocket knife activities ( i believe would gum it up , slow opening speed knife ) , so i anticipate blade should good , long life my care .	1

overall this great little knife . it opens fast , very sharp holds it edge well feels good your hand . liner lock great . i used some others absolutely hated them because they so hard operate . this one smooth silk located great position . very nicely designed . i make few changes which required going out buying torx screwdriver . first , i reversed pocket clip because it came facing opposite direction i used my spyderco knives . second , safety go . i found it slipped " " position its own so knife not open when you expected it hard disengage quickly . not because it difficult operate , rather it tiny hard find blind . if you like safety though , it definitely prevent blade opening accidentally . speaking safety ... knife arrives razor sharp . i opened my package promptly sliced finger badly enough leave scar . tension blade under requires some force overcome gives it different feel when closing knife regular lockback . sure you fingers nowhere near blade . i am now habit disengaging lock closing pressing back blade against my thigh	1
when i used lighter , less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice . if my toe caught mat , edge would flip over require adjustment . also , they not cushion very well . addition , lesser mats wore out quickly replaced . when doing poses like side-arm balance , my foot would slip off end regular length mat i would fall out pose . extra-long manduka mat , none these issues problem . mat solid dense , stays put floor no matter what i . it cushions really well , but because it so dense it no problem balance or move mat ( not mushy ) . i beat daylights out these mats they still look great . durability outstanding , they show no signs wearing out . ever . extra length allows me move confidence , knowing i won't run out room or slip off mat . additional benefit long mat it allows you change your starting position mat somewhat , so small area worn your feet not same every practice . other words , you spread wear over larger area make it last even longer . surface plenty sticky normal yoga , if you hot yoga class or sweat lot you likely want towel anyway . no complaints stickiness . weight , it seems if you big enough need extra-long mat you probably plenty strong enough carry it around . it ain't heavy , it best yoga mat i've ever seen .	1

gotta say i love this step even more so deal : not only you get step , but you also get four raising-blocks * * step-workout dvd -- all under $50 !!! i think that bargain compared buying pro-equipment ( i think it $70-80 pro step $40-50 two raising blocks , plus $15 dvd ... that , like , $140-150 ! ) . step * * smaller than steps you're probably used gym , but it not * * much smaller -- i would say it 25% shorter length-wise . it gotta though , i mean it at-home step so they're making it more storable . i guess if you're big person it might little frustrating first , but i don't see how you couldn't adjust it . then again , i'm 5'2 petite so me it perfect size ! haha : pthe dvd pretty good . it pretty simple , basic stepping though , so if you're advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast . however , it get you sweat little , so it not complete waste . if not stepping , though , keep it abs workout -- omg it amazing !! only 10 minutes it really makes you want commit stomach suicide . haha which good thing because next day your tummy sore but flat . :) but really , it good dvd , especially those lazy days you know you need workout but don't want ( least not too hard ) . lolbuy this kit , it * great * deal it'll get you shape ! :	1

i've owned three pairs these so far , they're easily best gloves i've ever used . i previously only used unpadded gloves , padding palm seemed little thick first . padding make it more difficult get solid grip some exercise machines also large rubber grips them ( lat pulldown bars , example ) , but that trade off excellent support protection when using gloves machines uncovered metal grips . i found these gloves more durable than other non-padded harbinger gloves i've worn . gloves safely washed air dryed , advertised . my only complaint regard wear unreinforced leather where my thumb meets padding palm seems wear out before rest glove . every pair i owned eventually wear hole this particular area .	1

just 3 weeks ago , i came here looking reviews tony little gazelle freestyle , read mixed reviews . however , most encouraging , i thought it sounded like thing me . i now used gazelle less than 2 weeks , already seen results ! this no lie -- i lost 2 inches waist , 2 hips , 2 abdomin , 2 thighs . i'm just freaked you may , but i'm telling you , this honest truth ! i discouraged i not seeing any results scales lately , needed change things up , so i'd see something move again . this gazelle it me . this time , i'm only up 30 minutes day , 1-3/4 miles ... i'm still work progress . but these results no lie . just think how much results i'll see when i stay longer ! they advertise it low impact overall machine , it truly . i rheumatoid arthritis , fibromyalgia , so i looking something i could wouldn't hurt me . i honestly say i get full workout this machine ... oh , i forgot mention , also 1 inch arms . so , that total 9 inches 2 weeks . this best machine i've ever used , ( we also exercise bike , ab lounge , which i've not used last 2 weeks all , cause i getting such good workout gazelle ) i'm so happy i found it . i thank you people , users amazon.com, coming here posting your reviews , making it easy me know which machine buy . mine exact picture above , folds up . i also love feature . it not problem just fold it up lean it against wall beside my bed after each use . therefore , i've still got lots walking space beside my bed .	1

bike arrived fine condition , no problems bent or rusty parts like other people reported . it really easy assemble . once i assembled it i tried it out found it made really annoying noise wheel went around - if gears scraping against something . so , i undid all screws ( pain ) opened plastic-enclosed base . there bracket meant hold pulse wires out way , but adhesive it worn off or something it just kind hanging , would interfere gears . so i taped it side , closed plastic up , . since then bike worked really well . i wish there more ability move it back - it good length me but i see how someone taller could trouble it . seat not terribly comfortable , which gets problem longer rides , but it fixable pillow or cushion . console great - all information displayed all time . plenty resistance . overall there some problems it , but under two hundred dollars , i suppose i can't complain too much . definitely worth money	1

i bought this lifeline recently it excellent addition my home gym equipment . i'm not person who travels back forth gym each day . i also not like paying arm leg expensive pieces workout equipment eventually become expensive coat racks . this workout solution low tech it get . i agree previous reviews below -- you could almost make this one yourself . it consists strip mesh webbing -- like seatbelt material ; two adjustable , quick locking clips ; handles made webbing plastic tubes ; piece plastic tubing locks jungle gym into place when door shut . equipment simple , but sets up seconds . clips adjust quickly incredibly secure . it so simple -- but it really works . emphasis instruction sheet dvd came it , upper body strength . you chin ups -- regulating height , you work up lifting part your body weight full body weight . me , this best part jungle gym . my chin ups/pull ups improved remarkably using device . body rows , push ups , fly push ups also possible . using jungle gym , pushups take new dimension fuller range motion ( like atlas pushup)and given instability webbing , you also get more core workout . you use webbing balance well maintain better technique when doing squats . you also make exercises more challenging using fitness ball . you abdominal crunches holding handles lifting your feet floor . some exercises ( full body rows dips ) difficult when attached door lifeline suggests draping jungle gym over tree limb so you achieve truly vertical workout . i not yet tried using this over tree limb ... however , i able perform dips some creativity while attached door but it not easy . this not full fitness solution . but when used conjunction weights exercise bands , it really makes home gym complete . i searched pull up bar long time removable , but none current offerings fit odd sized door frames moldings my 99 year old house . jungle gym worked . given ability pull ups varying difficulty , it also improved my ability pull ups/chin ups over short period time . downside device it requires sturdy door door frame . i would leery using device door not close securely lock or if you worried integrity your house construction . remember , jungle gym strong enough hold your body weight , but door it connected able same . if not , you find yourself flat your back new home improvement project . remember too , when your feet touching ground you pull towards door , weight decreases you pull . this not defect device , it just physics situation . ( free weights , weight stable throughout your range motion . exercise bands weight increases band lengthens . ) also , this great device weight/circuit training , but not really aerobic solution . jungle gym , few exercise bands ideal travel . i used mine three lifeline exercise bands ( 2 r6s 1 r8 ) , exercise band door attachment lifeline triple grip handles . this yielded gym weighed less than two pounds , fit my suitcase easily allowed variety body weight resistance exercises	1
just purchased this chair 3 wks ago so far so good ! i use it almost every morning 15 minutes while i watch news . needed chair like this because i'm starting get gut my pants getting too tight . i hate exercizing definitely don't will/motivation go gym consistently . i bought ultra version because i needed able hide it away when it isn't used . once folded up ( 4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long ) it fits very nicely under my couch . it fairly easy fold up/unfold but it could easier which why i gave it 4 instead 5 stars . there 2 bungee type straps need unhooked , 2 curved handle bars need removed ( simple twist knobs ) , one stabilizer bar undone ( simple twist knob ) fold this unit down . removing parts folding unit takes less than 2 minutes . not difficult just wish it easier . overall , i would definitely make this purchase again knowing what i now know .	1

many years ago , acquaintance mine property manager low-rent motel . one morning , while he back office behind front desk , two men jumped over counter started beating door . he could see them , but they could not see him through privacy security glass . men continued beat door , trying get . he waited inside patiently , his glock pistol . soon door fell men ran inside , he shot them both . they turned out high school teenagers who trying break obtain crack money . i recalled many community dissaproved his actions . it turned out he plenty time leave through back door call help . when asked why he kill them , he simply said , " i own life anyone who threatens my personal safety . i it because it my right i could . " fortunately , it considered self-defense . i remembered he always carried short stick , attached his keys . it not until many years later i finally figured out what little wooden stick . i became interested self-defense decided buy baton myself . this my first kubaton . i concerned because this one pointed end . pointed end , although not sharp compared blade weapon , easily punch hole through four layers very heavy cordura cloth little effort my part . i afraid if ever i use it , amount damage it cause its design would make it hard me claim i acting self-defense . i bought kubaton , same manufacturer , flat end . replacement baton exactly like this one , except end flat . i tested replacement it also punch hole through heavy canvas . but it takes lot more force so . more importantly , average person , it looks less aggressive than this one . if i use it self-defense , presiding judge or jury might less likely think it weapon . if you not concerned perception , then get this pointed baton . if it easily punch hole through layers cordura cloth ( same material used heavy duty outdoor bags , outerwear , hiking shoes ) , it easily injure attacker who might wearing several layers clothes . but please understand some might put this same category they would knife . might make it difficult claim self-defense , event you use it protect yourself . my old acquaintance well-versed knowledgeable . he not only knew how use his weapons , but he also understood where line self-defense assault . he knew just limits what he could get away it use deadly force defend himself . this pointed baton , made out hardened aluminum alloy , probably such person . my friend tip:here tip old acquaintance mine . keys themselves part weapon . you make them more effective , which increase damage baton . take some keys you no longer use . any metal key would , but try find different sizes . four them would . take keys grinder ( even rasp ) sharpen teeth each key . now , put four keys keyring your regular keys . face sharp keys opposite directions . meaning two should face one way , but other two should face opposite direction . idea when you swing baton like flail , sharpened keys would cut into attacker flesh . keys faced opposite directions so you major damage regardless which direction you swinging . citan experiment : please keep mind you also cut your hand . i tried this technique . i wore pair leather work gloves swung against wooden post . sharpened keys bounced back hit back my hand . without gloves , my hand would gotten badly cut . what it worth , i swung against large watermelon keys didn't bounce back though . i don't anything else add here , except maybe it might good swing against attacker fleshy parts prevent keys rebounding . i'm not expert though . but it fun trying it watermelon	1
let me start out saying this rower not perfect . it , fact , flawed . you may noticed , i still gave it five star rating i try explain reasons doing so . reading reviews here , i noticed two complaints : one pointing out this machine doesn't perform same standards professional gym rowers other regarding assembly this machine . i researched various rowers available market quite while . i spent lot time effort driving around trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend informed shopper who wants get value his money . during my research , it became very evident my favorite rower water rower followed schwinn windrigger - both extremely smooth their operation . both also $1000 ! any rate , these sophisticated rowers gave me benchmark against which compare integrity it should surprise nobody integrity doesn't really come close performance either other two rowers . it shouldn't , given it substantially lower price . this exactly what it important considering this rower : you cannot expect get professional-grade rower such low price just like you cannot expect get comfort performance rolls royce if you buying honda . nonetheless , what you get integrity well within parameters what i would expect $200 . machine reasonably stable , it reasonably smooth , it provide great workout . noise level also not too bad actually seems less than windrigger . electric monitor basic provides speed , time , calories burned , distance . it also provides option continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all them during your workout . seat comfortable slides smoothly track whole thing actually pretty professional look it doesn't appear flimsy . i also quite surprised level resistance this rower provides - it much more than schwinn windrigger . addition , resistance adjusted pretty easily . i think my only disappointment air-flow created during operation not channeled toward person using machine aid cooling him/her down - but this certainly flaw i live . potential buyer you should also aware rower tends slide across smooth surfaces such tile - which means you need non-slip mat under it if you intend use it such surface . i said before , i also read least one person problem assembling this rower . i cannot confirm this problem . assembly extremely easy quick - even though instructions not greatest . however , it should quite clear most people where parts go what needs hooked up where . winding up chain onto gear wheel breeze , too . all you need unhook it retracting cord you hooked it up one or two steps before . i suppose person who wrote instructions could switched these steps make it more logical - but i said , instructions not great . taking all these factors into account , i think integrity provides fantastic product very low price . it exactly what it supposed it so surprisingly good manner . however , any product , your expectations should realistic if they , you not disappointed . if you expect gym-quality machine - you not get what you looking . if , however , you looking basic functional rower without all bells whistles high-end products , then this probably best deal you get	1

( i used it stuck traffic it also good stress reliever ) if i it again , i would probably not bought blue unless you very light grip , probably started red . i started use red black . red just right me , challenging fingers i am working my way use black consistently . although it doesn't seem like it first , black challenging hand fingers give good workout . just remember this mainly fingers hand exercise so very easy use gripping , challenge working out fingers . it not like using regular heavy hand grippers . it increased my hand strength grip just it me using it during course day without planned workouts . great product , excellent finger or hand exercise , good quality . also bought dmm products , great price fast shipping	1

i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

i own this cooler , circa 1968 . it bombproof looks like it survived tour vietnam , but we haul this bad boy out each summer because it job . cam lock lid keeps it flying free if jarred or jostled ; this very good thing if you take it fishing your catch inside . construction good enough last near 40 years use before considering replacement . it really survive many seasons use , which more than you say many fragile thermoplastic knockoffs . there few camping or summertime essentials universally adopted , but coleman steel cooler one . bring it your next outing , even if you boring cans diet coke inside , people stop check it out . -fred	1
this really good product . gym owner trainer southern calif . over 20 years i've seen used few products this one ranks near top . most fats m.c.t.s used energy , not make it taste better ! protein needs fat properly utilized body ! carbs sugars low , which make this true lean gainer . keep your protein high , your carbs moderate get some good healthy fats like flax or fish oil you've got diet grow some muscle	1

i bought both medium heavy tension gripmasters . medium ( red ) one not much challenge me . i'm man average build , i actually bought these because i starting weight training gym i wanted more grip strength my hands stronger forearms . i'd say if you looking individual finger strength , such playing instrument , then red gripmaster might enough resistance . but i use black one much more whole hand strength . product comes guide containing instructions variety exercises . i would also recommend visiting gripmaster website , they more complete list exercises , recommendations different sports	1
after much deliberation self debate , i bought this bike someone other than amazon . ( i spend 2 months doing research , then needed " immediate satisfaction " comes purchasing walk-in store ) . i've it since right after thanksgiving , think it one better purchases i've made . it seems fan-type exercise bike you get fewer bells whistles , but more strength reliability . i've one treadmill one " fancy " exercise bike die after just few months . while this machine doesn't play music or show me videos try make me believe i'm riding through french country side , it feel like it might just last forever .	1
let me start saying this wonderful product . small , light , well constructed ( they feel like they last forever ) . you carry them you , allowing workout your fingers office , home or wherever you find suitable . i bought four different color-coded gripmasters : black/heavy , red/medium , blue/light , yellow/extra light . i only found resistance red black ones useful me , but my wife loves blue yellow ones . it great buy because their high quality affordable price . product comes foldable instruction booklet where you find details six different exercises : - trigger pinch . this one simulates movement squeezing trigger , it isolates index finger enhanced strength coordination . - gross grasp . this one strengthens fingers , thumb , wrist forearm firm grip . - hook position . this one strengthens longer muscles forearm wrist while stretching smaller muscles hand greater motion endurance . - tip tip pinch . this exercise strengthens specific fingers , thumb , smaller hand muscles forearm greater control endurance . - wrist flexion . it strengthens wrist forearm muscles . - key pinch . strengthens thumb index finger greater stability coordination . gripmaster website you find more exercises different activities sports . if you looking crush hands when handshaking this not product you , but if you need finger strength , control , endurance coordination you right place	1

billy great , full energy enthusiam . i get great results his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results his workout . his customer service rep helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i've doing business amazon many years placed over 150 orders . i never , never once any problems my orders amazon . when i questions , it amazing not only how quick amazon reply but give long thorough kind explanation . because they reply within day take so much time response , it shows they truly care you want give you best service possible . i've never found customer service this very high rare quality . november 2005 , after ordering billy bands official billy bank website . i sent package , without my permission company contained billy energy formula supplements . it 14 day delayed bill 31.85 . i upset this sent without me knowing but here worse part . i contacted customer service , gentleman told me don't worry you haven't billed just send us back package we'll credit you $5 into your account shipping , packaging , mailing cost you pay out your own pocket items sent back . within few days i send product i never requested back . twice phone once email 3 different cust rep i told i would receive $5 credit my bank account within 7 10 days . i already upset this matter but it wasn't big concern . however , 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received $5 credit my account . but there charge taken their company without my permisson or authorization my own personal bank account $8.97 . few days later $8.97 put back into my account . when i contacted company this their reply : thank you your recent e-mail . we apologize inconvenience . our records show your vitamin shipment 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent item i never wanted back 7 days not over 14 day limit ) . this means when charges actually went through , you only charged small portion amount showed invoice ( i kept copy nowhere invoice this stated ) . you received credit shipping handling plus 5.00 dollars ship it back too . this means , when charge vitamins actually went through you only charged 8.97 . this also refund you received , amount paid ( again since item sent back within 14 days i shouldn't charged nowhere invoice this stated i would only charged small portion ) . so basically they sent me product i never requested . told me they would give me some money product sent back . took money my bank account without me knowing paid me back my own money they stolen . sum it up , business amazon !	-1
i got few great chuckles out this thing . just get kinda grossweird using it over nad over again . but great one no matter	1

i write lot reviews books , but seldom write one product . however ; i feel like breaking my trend reviewing this lite . i , like i suppose , just everyone else , keep looking lite right all people , all purposes . if it exists , i haven't seen it ye t.t he plain ordinary battery flashlight remained essentially same since i got my first kid , 60 years ago . they often fail you when they needed , batteries expensive , but overall they serve purpose . 50 years ago , hand held magneto lite appeared . long you kept squeezing it , it gave light comparable normal flashlght . it similar lite sold use bicycle , where it powered turning wheel . however ; soon bicycle stopped , light went out . some reason , they disappeared off market . few years ago , new almost similar magneto lite appeared . biggest difference , it made lot noise when squeezed . they don't appear very popular . this faraday principle lite made very popular due tv ads , more because what they don't say than what they say , many people disappointed upon getting one . ad flouts idea it seen up mile . sowhat !, we learned military , lit cigarette seen hundreds yards away night . so , if that not you looking , it meaningless you . fact , it very poor casting light suface more than few feet away . this purpose , it can't begin compete normal flashlight ; if that what you want , forget it . matter fact , those little led keychain lites just much ; picked up buck " dollar stores " . they last couple years , weigh next nothing , you'll always one you . i leave them around house they handy look something dark spot , or occasional time you need find circuit breaker panel or find your way power failure . these lites so weak you can't assume they meet your expectations store , or watching tv ad . my advice try compare key chain lite , one might serve you well other , huge difference cost .	1
i like this product great taste i don't need blender mix it - shaker cup all you need so it very easy get ready quickly . i've using it 2 weeks actually lost body fat so no complaints here ( started 14% , 12% now ) give it try , really only way tell your yourself . it easy enough adjust how thick you want your shake , just add more water thinner drink . 2 scoops 10oz water thin fluid , my personal preference	1
this pillow small compact . it just right size traveling camping it stays fluffed through night	1
i recieved my product record time i very pleased assembly quick simple just like box said !!! i so pleased i purchased diego bike dora bike !!	1
very nice bike , especially sale price . it warning inside box : this product contains products known state california cause cancer . not sure what they referring . this second toy i see it . perhaps someone shed some light	1
i bought this my son two half years age , even seat all way down , his feet barely make ground he looks intimidated . he too young . his big brother , age seven , thought it hoot , wheeled around confidently , but he too big . quality construction excellent , assembly easy . orange wheelcovers come off so you get valve stems put air tires . we also kettler trike they're terrific , too . get trike age 2-3 . get this age 3-4 . spoil them rotten	1
i finally chance wear this glove it truely no numbness glove . my hand felt fine after 15 miles riding . my old gloves my hands would start bothering me after 1 mile riding ! you can't beat price these gloves either . i highly recommend these gloves	1
one thing i really like there no plastic or rubber taste first use . it holds enough long bike ride cold all way end ride . it feels good your back too . it helps this florida heat . cons : mouth piece hard hold onto because 180 degree angle . it would easier mouth piece . i looking replacement .	1
after sweating slipping many vinyasa class ( even " non-slip " mat ) , friend recommended this yoga towel . this product saved my yoga practice ! it take one or two classes get used , but once you , you off non-slip yoga bliss . plus , well-placed circle top mat gives you visual focus stay centered . thank you yogitoes	1

we've this 2 years now it still working just great . i am truly amazed how much better i feel after good stretch it very helpful chronic backpain	1
this strong , stable , all features tables three times its price . it helps relieve my back pain . i think it help even more i use it more	1
this inversion table decent piece equipment . it sturdy , not hard assemble relatively inexpensive compared similar units . it feel good your back , but don't expect hang upside down very long , it take some time get used blood rushing your head which cut short time your back feel decompressed or stretched out .... whatever term you want use . some reviewers mentioned ankle brackets uncomfortable ; i didn't find them too bad , mostly it take some time get used held upside down your ankles . if you kind frail bones , then i could see this problem because you holding your body weight your ankles . while it not designed go totally vertical , you get there walking your hands back floor . instructions say it lock into place if you go vertical , but i haven't found true , maybe other peoples but mine doesn't . all all , if you really sure you want inversion table don't want invest lot money into it , then this table fit your needs . one recommendation : if you ,... try using inversion table friends or store couple times make sure this something you really use .	1
this classic wiffle bat , fluorescent yellow 32 inches long . lot people try sell you black-and-white bat , or red bat flares out end . you must decline these bats , politely but firmly . wiffle bat stood test time , continue so long after imitators gone . most people know wiffle bat ideal hitting aptly-named wiffle ball , but few newcomers know bonus features : 1 ) if your opponent throws hanging curveball you make solid contact , ball slide down bat even you hitting it . result monstrous home run makes whistling sound it disappears into your cranky neighbor yard . 2 ) lower part wiffle bat textured grip . nice . 3 ) base bat little hole it , when bat waved around , makes cool , low-pitched whistle not unlike hum light saber . highly recommended anyone ball , yard , friend	1
i found this product ( hydration pack ) every thing i read it i am very satisfied it ..	1
this home plate solid good quality last many years backyard baseball games	1
it hard find tricycle rubber treads wheels . most trikes big wheels hard plastic wheels which slip concrete when kid pedals ... i liked this one , it easy put together , except front decorative plate dora it , but it wasn't necessary my daughter doesn't know who dora so i just didn't put it ... trike small enough really petite or young child , which why i bought it . we bigger trike ( radio flyer ) which no where near small enough our 2 year old ... my only complaint bar seat attached connects rear axle just little bit loose-fitting but it doesn't seem causing problem . very good trike overall	1
ok , i should first say i'm not great golfer . i started playing few weeks ago , bought these online because they looked like great deal . customer mine invited me out golf outting , club rental fee course more than i wanted pay , i'd most likely doing this again ( it not really game , it now ? ) i figured these would pay themselves 2 or 3 outtings . i'm not great golfer , i don't know much clubs . but , these seemed swing ok , my buddies kind impressed considering what i paid , i didn't too badly . nothing came broken , nothing broke course , drivers decent range , irons they're job . if you're tall like i am , you'll find irons little short need get grips extended . i'm 6 ' 4 " . i'll keep these until my game deems me worthy something nicer	1
this purchased xmas present my wife . she uses it daily claims it helped her chronic back pain . table excellently made . it very sturdy ! design well-engineered . it perfectly balanced when set up correct body height . very good buy	1

lanyards whistles purchased christmas gift which well received . thank you	1
pink color this bag not same shade pink 1/4 " extra thick deluxe high density yoga mat . it looks pink/purple , yet mat hot pink . however , it fits mat very nicely . also , it very light weight , it very easy fold up when not used . even though it no extra pockets cell phone stuff , i think it better than canvas bags which quite heavy . i bought this bag mat same time , so shipping rate not too bad . course , it would better if it cheaper	1
i would normally wear totes abercrombie or hollister . when i saw black crazy dots i thought it looked really cool ! this best backpack i ever found i wish i figured out long time ago . bit you know what they say it better late then never finding out . overall jansport mad great , durable , cute backpace . i reccomend it anyone needs new , stylish backpack	1

pump came ball easy use , i shocked how quickly i able blow up ball it . not saying it didn't hurt my arm , but i'm quite out shape - hence fitness ball ! it really just took few minutes , it blown up . i little confused first how fit pump into hole , but once i got figured out , it went very smoothly . ball itself very easy use , it works really well . " fitness guide " it comes nothing more than small piece paper three or four exercises drawn out . i thinking it going dvd or something . $15 though , i can't complain . i think it completely worth $15 i paid it .	1
these best pair weightlifting gloves i owned . they last forever , not tear . also great batting biking	1

i've riding wooden boards over 2 years now . i saw this board sale thought it way too cheap full fiberglass/foam board - but i decided take risk give it try . it major upgrade my wooden boards . this , i waveskim or sandride . it very light weighing only 5 lbs , mild rocker , comes limited lifetime warranty . it not going perform well $200 - $300 namebrand boards like victoria , exile , zap , etc . ; but price i paid i'm very happy	1
i am very satisfied quality also supply chain management . thanks	1
like chive , this knife nice small package that deceptively stabby . sure , it looks innocent , but how much blade you want your eye ? hypothetically speaking , course . i would never indicate you should stab people this knife . never ever . high points sleek design , flawless assisted opening , light weight . i problems thumb studs assisted opening knives , so i am very pleased this index opening . safety-conscious , there safety lock keep blade opening your pants . not it , but just case i guess . leek perfect knife people small hands ; i assisted opening definite bonus . too many assisted opening knives too bulky my hand , or too powerful when it snaps open ( kershaw tactical blur , example ) . leek firmly snaps into place without " recoil " light small enough people small hands easily use . but don't fooled its innocent appearance . this knife deadly little package should not underestimated	1
knife sleek great profile . i love speedsafe function it . blade lock bit stiff , but i suppose that just so it doesn't slide open accident	1
one i ordered seemed black so its plus me since i like black knives ... i guess i cant really call it knife or sword it would stack up more small hunting machete . very well build light but strong . recomend it camping	1
i ordered this mat when i started morning exercise class includes yoga . i like size , but especially thickness . past experience , i know how uncomfortable it doing sit-ups without sufficient padding . this mat plenty ! i couldn't more satisfied	1
i use basement floor which concrete , but there carpet over padding . really makes difference using this mat . very comfortable	1

i love this trailer . when i started looking trailer , i saw how expensive some other brands like burley chariot . i thought i would spend lot money get decent one . but talking women my bike club , i got many recommendations instep because you get them reasonable price they durable . so i bought this one , it very easy put together . no tools needed . i love how it not pain rear use ! it attaches bike very easily . i also bought second coupler through instep my husband bike . so we easily switch trailer bike bike even mid-ride if we ever needed . it collapses almost completetely storage which nice thing . my son who 15 months old almost 30 lbs uses it seems comfortable since he loves riding it .	1
this sword awesome replica terms actual size sephiroth . only thing i think takes away sword handle plastic wrapped black cloth . when sword held outstretched , it become very heavy lot pressure put handle . despite handle cloth , sword overall massive amazing behold . great collectible any ff goru	1
much i love anime , stuff this sword actually isnt real enough any ' swordplay ' . it hard accept it isnt truly real , but it isnt hard accept after you get all fanboy-ish fantasy nonsense arranged properly your mind , albeit thats only rather obvious ' con ' it . other than its truly wicked artifact , ff7 fans its almost like piece game memoriablia , also wonderful thoughts weilding blade similar who could quite possibly greatest villain all time . btw , weilding thing quite feat , someone short arms struggle getting sword out themselves(but thats hardly my problem my arms sorta lanky ) rules physics . last but not least , your official piece property ( after you drooled or allowed some other bodily fluid somehow leak onto it ) , just remember 2 important things .... #1 ) take care it , rust constant threat any metal or combination metals , #2 ) don't let size it go your head , also try keep it home . i dont think local authorities would like pull someone over typical traffic violation only discover they carrying blade over 4 feet long their vehicle . just word advice	1
such detail , such fine work . this near exact replica , down tiniest details ! it shame blade isn't 7 or 8 feet long like real thing , but makes it all more better ! weildable masamune !!! this makes me wanna buy it !!	1
this glove fits very well comfortable wear . it seems breathe relatively well secured velcro straps . i'm very happy mine , purposes everyday workout glove . would recommend	1
i wear them riding my bike work back . i work out doors handle alot money , they perfect counting money , keeping my hands warm riding my bike . they well made strong	1
i found assembly this bike very easy . you'll need ratchet , 2 sockets . open end wrench , 2 hex wrenches , 40 minutes . handlebars , seat , front tire , pedals . air tires . then final adjustments seat handlebars . that it . my brakes gears needed no adjustments . reviewer who trouble must truely gotten oddball item . my guess his cycle returned item re-shipped parts thrown haphazardly back box . after 35 years riding racers upright riding position take some getting used me . still i found bike ride smooth comfortable . my amazon gold box discount free super saver shipping this great bike great price .	1
much better than conventional round mirrors which only slightly larger than dental mirror . many cases i still needed twist around see - no pleasure bad back . it not issue this mirror .	1
our daughter loves this pizza set . it wonderful pretend play , our daughter loves pretend take our orders mix match toppings create her own custom slices ( pepperoni only daddy , mushroom broccoli mommy , please ) . we're also using it learn very basic math skills . it helps her visualize 1/2 1/4 , understand simple addition subtraction ( " if you three broccoli florets take one away , how many left ? " ) . this nice , quiet travel toy . it made fabric , it soft lightweight , velcro helps keep all pieces together . we just returned long road trip this toy didn't lose single piece	1
we so looking forward using this over spring summer this year . i purchased bocce ball sets past this one sure heft make it comparable proper sets , but without huge price .	1
i bought this some skepticism , read other reviews gave it low marks , also bought thule products past cursed them i tried assembling installing them , what missing pieces like . happily , this box fine . it seem flimsy when you're assembling it , it even seems way when it open top car . it seems engineered light possible , which it , unnerving until you get it fastened down locked closed . assembly : it awkward . it took two us , me my 2 year old ! seriously . it bit hairy one person get it right , since you match hinges sides " clam shell " , their fit doesn't seem quite right until you tighten them up well . still , it went ok , 20 minutes me , far better than thule roof racks i installed some years back , where i dealing bent missing parts . if you this alone , you need brace it well angle you hook top bottom together . much easier two people . installation : dead easy factory roof rack . ( we pontiac aztek . ) there no need buy additional brackets , though when viewing ads this , you might think so first glance . package includes 4 u-brackets which attach your roof racks held inside hand-swivel bolts ( whatever they're called ) . one thing i added while doing installation put duct tape over inside holes u-brackets . there several holes each sequence , you only use two out 4 or 5 ; others exposed . covering tape might help keep spray out . performance : pretty good ! we drove 2300 miles this unit , which 300 driving rain . during worst rain , we dampness some droplets water bottom front inside , but gear sitting up ridges fine - bag front damp but not wet . if you cloth bags press very bottom , i'd put them plastic if you'll hitting heavy rain ( ours very heavy , 70 mph driving speed ) . we noticed increase wind noise high speeds , our rough tests , it knocked 2 mpg off our gas mileage 75 mph , but 50 mph stretch several hundred miles we couldn't tell difference . removal takes literally five minutes . you undo ( hand ) four pairs swivel bolts , lift it right off roof . reinstallation same . overall , we're extremely happy it very glad we bought it	1
i've my kurt kinetic road machine since 2001 it never leaked . i put average 1200 miles per winter it it always reliable , relatively quiet , better feel than any non-fluid trainer . road machine pro even heavier flywheel so offers even better feel , i'd say . best thing you could read reviews other sites . try couple out local bike shop then buy best . after all my initial reviews ongoing knowledge bike trainers , kurt still best .	1
i pretty soft skin , these don't give me blisters after wearing hour or two . they work ok rain , occasional washing managed not reek	1
i bought my xtreme 2 bowflex because time they offered free shiping . but since amazon ships this item bowflex anyway its still great deal here . even after month using this machine i can't believe how well its made how many exercises you . it not take up much room either . i looked home gyms far wide me i could not find better value price quality . i also comes instructions diet plan help you get bowflex body .	1
i ton research before buying x2 . i run treadmill 3 or 4 days week ( 12-15 miles week ) work up good sweat , my lower body pretty lean . however , almost 40 , not trained weights since high school , i felt i needed start doing some weight/resistance training , particularly my upper body . well , after 3 weeks , i tell huge difference after using this machine . i'm also glad i got x2 instead because ability work out faster without pully changes . i also able gradually increase weight so i'm going buy two 50 rod extensions . i highly recommend this machine anyone who doesn't feel comfortable gym , and/or just doesn't time go . i small kids able hit this machine 5:30 am when everyone still asleep huge benefit me . assembly , it fairly easy if you follow directions . only difficult part pully system - make sure you it right backbone entire system . pics instructions could little clearer . otherwise , bottom line this thing works great purchase .	1
this really nice basketball system .... but instructions very difficult follow ... it took 3 adults 3 hours put it together . i would definately recommend this product just make sure you plenty patience when it time put it together	1
this basketball hoop nice looking , sturdy perfect home use . someone else set it up me said it wasn't complicated but it take some time work . i take notes other reviewers passed them person who put it together . it arrived perfect condition , all parts , arrived time . overall , we very pleased	1
this excellent product money . we researched quite bit before we bought it read all reviews amazon . we little worried putting it together becasue all negitive reviews we read . but , we didn't any trouble . it went together simply easily . we careful read all instuctions before we began kept ready few steps ahead it wasn't hard all . our kids playing non stop ever since	1

this gun ( seen under bunch different names here amazon , if they look alike , chances they're all double eagle m83 ) really impressed me day it came ( only 4 business days ship la pa ) . while i waiting battery charge , i toyed around gun . sight comes standard gun pretty handy , but it almost required remove handle part sight nearest trigger but electric sight . even then , it more showy accesory than anything because you aim higher than crosshair shows . flashlight nice addition everything well . you careful when putting strap because my friend , who bought same gun , put his strap came off , resulting gun falling ground , barrel hitting first , mock silencer broke off . my strap hasn't failed me yet , just like every other part gun . so now fun . if you plan using this gun during wars/capture flag/etc ., i strongly suggest you buy extra magazine speed loader practice reloading . gun accurate up 30 feet until it starts curve little , unless you use useful hop up system . switching lever ' normal ' ' hop up ' mode , your gun puts more backspin bbs , making them curve upwards get more distance . this great shooting people high up far away once you get aiming down . automatic function lot fun great taking out lots people during gameplay . magazine runs out fast though , so use it sparingly . i measured fps range 220-260 , depending battery power , type bbs ( . 12 gram giving highest fps ) , wind . i've used it 2 battles so far , both which 4 hours long . battery didn't even show signs slowing down , so just keep it charged you'll fine . i highly recommend this gun anyone looking impress hours upon hours fun friends . pros : -6 setting adjustable shoulder stock easily caters your shooting style . -high battery life keeps you game all day long . -gun hasn't jammed once over 8 hours use . -hop up system great extra distance . -looks pretty sweet . -accessories ( flashlight , electronic sight , extra barrel ) fun addition gun . -powerful , but not too powerful children all ages . -realistic look weight gives you feel actual m16 . ------------------------------------------- cons : -only accurate up 30 feet until bbs begin curve . -plastic screw-on barrel chance breaking if dropped barrel . -sight complicated until you get used gun . -reloading annoying , but not problem if you practice	1
obviously this machine doesn't speed dial , so you control speed . you direct your own workout really drive make your own workout . other than - it easy set up , fun use , job price . if you want something cheap because you can't afford " real thing " , this perfect buy	1
i just finished my first workout gazelle edge . i wanted something would make aerobic excercise convenient ( my garage ) when weather nasty -and i didn't want spend alot money . overall , it very good job what i wanted . i using very inexpensive machine similar motion many years great success . my previous machine ran track wheels , like gazelle handles arm motion(although separate foot action ) , no tension adjustment very basic computer . i literally wore this old machine out . i decided since i stuck this machine so long , i could treat myself something fancier - i knew it wouldn't become clothes hanger . i started my hunt tried several high end , fancy , expensive units , but kept saying myself .... " why i need all this stuff ? would i even use it ? " most retail stores i checked only carried things " bells whistles " , so , i searched yard sales goodwill something simple , no luck . it all too fancy ( still expensive ) or too beat up run down . anyway , i search amazon thinking if i going spend bunch money , i better know what i getting . i found gazelle , read reviews decided give it try . it seemed like many different abiliity levels happy it , price fair motion similar what i used . glad i . i think it going great . far no tension adjustment , i don't problem , maybe because i'm used it . it also seems like you get more tension arms pulling against motion your feet . my only big complaint ( why i gave 4 stars instead 5 ) speed calibration computer very " choppy " ( lack better word ) . i would going very fluid , steady pace speed reading would vary 2-3 mph period just few seconds . i tried it slow fast speeds ... always same . only one i think accurate 0 . i always used speed ( my old unit ) help me regulate my interval training . if i can't figure out " secret " getting read consistently , i guess i'll guess it . also , i don't think you should rely calorie meter correct . like reviewer mentioned , you can't sure without knowing alot other variables . but , it useful comparing one workout . ( if you write things like down . ) not complaint so much fyi . if you looking aerobic workout machine use home this should trick . just remember , like any exercise program or machine , results you get going direct result effort you put into it	1
i bought my whisperlite 1996 yet problem it . ( i think i may cleaned it once ) simmering bit trick but if you use it several times before taking it into woods you should able cook any food you take back pack . there stories these stoves going into " meltdown " during light up cold days but it always because user either over primed stove or using damaged fuel line . if you accidentally over prime not add more fuel . just let what you burn off . i never problems lighting stove or keeping it going ( although i run out fuel once ) . light very easy use . funny thing , it bit loud but you never notice until you turn it off .	1
this very comfortable , easy set up , sturdy product . it little big carry your back - we tried it . but good camping near car	1
shoes great cannot faulter them . am hanging weather cool little give them propper flogging	1
we purchased this hike we doing this year , previously this same area we serious problem ticks . this year we didn't even see any ticks so i can't say if this product would helped area . but , we see lot mosquitoes , 5 us went there total 1 bite , both days we woods . spray doesn't seem repel mosquitoes , since we saw lot them , them buzzing around us . i am not sure its killing power since i didn't see any dead mosquitoes my clothes . but i didn't see any live mosquitoes my clothes either . it kind hassle treating clothes prior trip , so i would only recommend this product if you knew you going bug infested location few days . otherwise use more convenient bug spray	1
this most adorable bike ever . my granddaughter loves it . we needed replacement defective part it immediately sent us manufacturer . great product ... great service ... great value	1
we love our new schwinn exercise bike ! i checked consumer reports this one best price ( 340.00 ) . we extremely happy fast shipping bike- although box bashed corners box open !! assembly direct not difficult except shoving back ( seat ) section into front half bike . it took all our strength , then we realized wiring cramped up inside we pull it apart again . next time we shoved two together , it slid easily we watched wires . this caution not instructions- you may even need tape wire hold it place- maybe not best design . everything else absolute peach ! seat very comfortable , monitor/display easy read , seat adjustable two tall people- bike super comfortable . warranty least year . thanks schwinn , thanks amazon helping us get back shape time summer	1
this one few led flashligh t-t hings i really like . it gives room-filling light you hold it palm your hand . it dandy thing camping power outages , low power 25% setting longer battery life . it uses 4 aa batteries , but gives almost much light full-size 4-d coleman camping lantern krypton bulb . size surprising small : size regular 2-d flashlight minus head . it also 2 small , but nice features . top small loop handle made wire used hang or attach it things ; if you small fingers , it fit 2 fingers through . it also small feet you slide out greater stability . my only concern battery life : package not list it , but manufacturer website claims 80 hours . i am rather skeptical , so carry spares just case . mine new batteries , so i cannot tell .	1
i've mine three years now it works well . strap review complains necessary : it helps stabilize rack 1 1/4 inch hitch . if i it over , i probably would purchase receiver 2 inch hitch -- they appear more stable bike carriers . but those us 1 1/4 inch receivers , this rack works great . carrier well made keeps bikes away car . strap does't harm car -- my wife would kill me if i damaged her lexus rx300	1
this ball least expensive all my exercise equipment yet i use it more than all others . it very durable alot fun use . foot pump makes it extremely easy air up . i usually add little air every couple weeks . i use exercise chart came ball , but i haven't viewed dvd yet . i highly recommend this kit	1

i one these fans since year 2000 . i found my first one real goods store . used it my truck instead air conditioner my trailer . then i took it haiti used it my jeep . a/c works , but noisy eats lot gasoline . basically i prefer fan rather than chilled air . motor wiring still going strong , very well built . i replace fan blade itself once . replacement blade unit available thru marine supply store . ca-fra-mo means canadienne fractional motors . these units actually built north america . northern north america . canada . they still build things there . i need get i am kalifornya now left my fan jeep hayti . i'll buy it thru amazon all other purchase methods require entering credit card data again	1

this great pair adjustable dumbbells fraction cost . it very simple use takes place 8 sets dumbells very small space . it great trey everything fits besides it just looks cool . dvd workout comes gofit sportblock incredible . it produced mark verstegen who owner athletes performance considered best trainer nation . mark workout very simple takes 20 minutes whole thing but i seen incredible results my arms , stomach , legs , butt . it awesome ! buy it you won't sorry you see incredible results !	1
this great item . it looks awsome , feels awsome . but it not strong all . use this only working your stance , swing , control ... things like . not ... i repeat ... not go around hitting things this . it break faster then you say bull ( you finish this lol ) . i got it mail today end day i taping it up duck tape lol , because i practicing i hit my floor mistake . but anyway , this worth price . i'll buy it again if i money	1
cord-wrapped handle great idea , offering more real sword-like look well firmer grip . my hands tend get sweaty slip around bit long practice , particularly sealed lacquered finish most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed touch glue get it stay place ) . two-piece guard design nice enhancement too . though you really don't need guard all many applications it nice looking appears stronger than original . it still fairly cheap piece wood , compared ironwood version , but this price ( it $9.99 when i bought it ) you really can't go wrong . nice enhancement over basic bokken . recommended	1
i bought this pogo my oldest daughter 5 years ago . it through 5 children , twice yearly block parties , abandoned rain , generally abused . it still great shape right up until last week when my 7yo left it behind my car i ran it over . she now saving her allowance replace it identical pogo stick . it perfect petite children ... only one they've ever tried they actually get bounce . one few toys they've used year after year . update : replacement pogo just came today . although i expecting pink purple , color actually deep red blue . this neutral me we girls either color scheme works . this one looks even sturdier than one i ran over . frame larger diameter , it weighs little more , tip bigger heavier . good thing because i 3 more kids behind older ones who haven't yet sampled joys pogo-sticking	1
i got my daughter this pogo stick christmas she really loves it . it bit stiff first , just like enclosed directions indicated , but once i bounced it up down bit , it loosened up enough her weight it go up down bit . mine red blue - ok boy or girl . she great time learning how use it getting exercise same time .	1

we've debated getting my daughter octotunes because we've played around it stores it seems like fun toy . her father i both some musical background band want her engaged music when she older . we thought fo $5.29 this would bargain since octotunes $25 . when it came i thought it cute but noticed immedietly legs don't honk nicely octopus . not only but one them doesn't honk all unless you really squeeze it . i can't imagine young child able it . shell which supposed like drum makes almost no noise . would nicer if it more hollow . instead it sounds like equivilent banging wall . head- which maraca- barely makes noise . whole toy leaves much desired . although i can't complain price we paid , it nice size toy even though it rather large bulky young baby , i expecting bit more . it colorful cute but that all it .	1

most us who exercise regularly , bowflex sport fine exercise machine . unfortunately though , two hundred ten pounds resistance not enough . 310 lb . upgrade neccessity serious workout . i found upgrading 310 lbs ., i can't bench press whole machine . i would recommend any serious lifter , when you buy bowflex sport immediately upgrade 310 lbs	1
i really like this bike ... it great little starter ' road ' bike . it take some rougher terrain , but i wouldn't take it off roading constantly . i don't think it built tolerate whole lot . after assembling bike we take it our local bike shop spent $10 getting it adjusted just right ... gears weren't shifting right lower 4th 5th . they getting hung up little , but shop fixed right up . seems something bent little . i also brakes adjusted they riding rims wheels they definitely weren't supposed close ! nice bike price though free shipping ! can't beat it	1
we purchased this item 2 months ago our very active 1 year old . we found it nearly impossible keep up her all time , however when we put her pack ' play she would scream . this perfect alternative . we purchase two them ( she needs lot space ) . assembly easy , its easy get out , but she could not pull it apart- gate very secure she loves toys attached back pen . my only complaints this : it still relatively small- i said we purchased two them make large pen- superyard xt comes more panels but i felt edges sharp , there no gate , it hard pull apart . also toys run out battery so fast , there no or off switch them	1

i ridiculously large books half hour walk train station each day . unlike every other backpack i've tried , straps this one yet start ripping or fraying apart bag . only feature i miss buckle connecting two straps across front chest , so they don't pull apart shoulders . however , bag heavy-duty roomy , i'm easily able fit my laptop , con law book ( maybe largest book ever made ) , crim law book ( 2nd largest ever ) , pocket dictionary . overall , if you get good price i paid it , i would recommend it any student or other user ..	1

cathe friedrich my absolute favorite working out . this workout hard -- you feel it right away . it put together very well , you select exercises yourself or just hit ' play ' entire video . her personality great -- she very motivating , without " chatty . " i discovered cathe watching fittv , now own many her dvds . i just purchased this one my problem areas lower body . you need various equipment , though : high step , dumbells , barbell , stretch band , stability ball . since i exercising cathe , i eventually purchased all equipment use them all regularly . i highly recommend this dvd any cathe friedrich items !!!	1
if you seen my other cathe reviews , you'll know i think she fantastic makes you work hard , yet she motivating keeps it interesting . this dvd , you work your trouble spots very hard it tough ( but well worth pushing through ) . results found if you workout often . there wide spectrum exercises here . every possible movement ( like your squats lunges etc ) you feeling it no time . you start standing workout work glutes then classic floor moves like side leg lifts inner thigh work . you fatigue your muscles ( good way ) . following all this , there intense ab work she uses hand weights ankle weights up ante . other thing you should know , there lot equipment needed ( one reason i dropped star rating ) . you need different amounts weights , barbell , stability ball , resistance bands high step platform . personally me , if i need this much equipment , i'd rather go gym . cathe one tough trainer , but she give you results . after doing this workout first time , i didn't think i'd able make it out bed next morning . it good sore , so you know you've worked out well . i really recommend this , but not if you haven't used your glute or ab muscles some time	1
i am very happy my manduka purple lite mat ... i tried out friend original black manduka mat hoping get same quality little less weight carry around travel purple lite mat ... i wasn't dissapointed ! manduka mats so great because their density ... they provide thicker cushioning other ' thick ' mats , but unlike other mats , they also dense enough support wrists , which take alot stress regular yoga practice . i recommend this mat anyone who regularly practicing yoga ... investment worth it	1

i purchased this product local sports show , paid $15 more it than it here . price aside , it decent gun , much better than my first aeg . if you use . 2 gram bbs , it reasonably accurate , even wind . it seems really sturdy , but i'll really find out my first op my friends spring . there problems , though : mag capacity small , especially full auto . i would advise purchasing extra clips , which go 3 10 bucks apiece connected easy reloading . careful when loading : there little switch feed ammo send your just-loaded bbs , all over place . also , scope came mine poor : adjustments light not affect position light . overall great buy those just getting into airsofting . heck , this price , why not buy two go rambo your friends ? :) ps-i'm not really beth ; i'm her 15-year-old son	1

stand assembles around 10-15 minutes , depending if you know which pre-drilled holes use or not . build quality reasonable , but bolts casters don't all fit screw evenly . this doesn't affect functionality , but seems like something shouldn't issue w/ today manufacturing technologies . casters great , allowing some movement bike stand without removing bike . only areas improvement maybe some better design or feature further prevents wheel tipping/leaning either direction . preferably simple machining or stamping solution part regular manufacturing process doesn't increase price would best . compactness good , too . i 6 bikes garage , they all store neatly next each other . value , convenience , size this stand strong points .	1
those who may new suunto , they wris t-t op computers designed manufactured finland use all over world hikers , bikers outdoor enthusiasts all kinds . what makes x-lander stand out first glance , obviously its sheer size . let there no illusions , x-lander mighty big watch . despite its size , it doesn't feel big it looks , though . aluminum case very light quite comfortable , too . next thing you notice would huge amount bells whistles packed into such small device . #1 . accurate altimeter . this invaluable tool avid hiker biker . one thing you must ready remember adjust it daily . find out what altitude set watch before you begin your trip , then end day you need make note where you stopped ( which you internal recording function ) properly adjust it before setting out next day . this not flaw , every single altimeter watch i am aware exactly same . #2 . barometer . i found it correct least 75% time , which more than i say local tv weatherman . this includes thermometer well , which order accurate must removed your wrist least 15 minutes order not get false reading due lingering body heat . #3 . digital compass . this truly one amazing feature , way . once you calibrate it ( which you may need weekly ) you never lost -- especially if you know how use map . #4 . it tells pretty accurate time , too believe it or not . it also comes alarm , countdown stopwatch . suddenly its size now makes sense , huh ? i happen like big watches . i don't exactly know why , but i just . if i any complaint whatsoever , one thing this watch lacking exactly what they included much less expensive vector : tiny little bubble which helps you level out watch compass mode more precise reading . reason why may fact x-lander mineral crystal vector plastic , but either way , it'd nice . i am very impressed just everything associated suunto their fantastic line what they call , wristop computers . if size really matter you , well you may wish go observer or maybe x6hr ( which everything x-lander observer plus it built-in heart-rate-monitor ) both smaller than x-lander , vector , yachtsman many other suunto models yet still offers lot -- but keep mind smaller size comes bigger price . factor all into your purchase plans once again , if all possible , not buy until you chance see some these ( or any ) models person . make huge difference how happy your purchase end up ... good luck !	1
this basketball so cool ! dual action micro pump works . it kind hard pop micro pump out . you push down pump , while you push down pump you unscrew it . it takes long time pump , though . deflate ball , you push down pump . ball doesn't stay inflated long . basketball feels good , it good grip . silver paint fades away quickly . i recomend you buy this !!!!!!!!!	1

overall , this pretty good gun . it shoots fast hard advertised , but its main drawback battery , which take long time install first time . after little practice however , it gets much easier . when i first got my gun tried fire it , there gear churning but no firing . thankfully there " hex " tool fix gears easily . my main disappointment seller this item . i bought gun when it advertised current price , but day after it arrived information it changed new parts included making it now ris version . ( i really wanted flashlight ... ) addition flap gate over hop up system , though not very important , not working because spring attaching it come loose . despite this it most definately best automatic airsoft gun one canbuy under $70 once kinks worked out ( ie . gearbox hop-up adjustment ) i greatly recommend this gun all those budget , or looking just play woods-games their friends	1
i'm pleased quality this lunch box . two separate insulated compartments very nice . salt pepper shakers nifty extra . just make sure keep box right side up or shakers pour out . i haven't owned this product very long , so i can't vouch its durability . it appears very well made quality materials . this box may bit pricier , but quality , extra compartment flatware/shaker pocket worth it . using this daily basis work instead eating out pay its self month or so .	1

this stroller quickly replaced our travel system ( stroller+car seat)for several reasons : 1 . ease navigation swivel front wheel great those times you push one handed 2 . wheels sturdy ( wheels our combo system snapped off ) 3 . it folds same size previous one just same amount storage space . if i one area improvement it would drink cup holders aren't deep enough . when we out jogging roads sometimes little bumpy water bottle bounce out , but you get those drink holder adjusters auto store should solve this problem	1

i enjoyed using this jade mat past 10 months or so . my only real gripe it wore out so quickly . fair , though , it didn't last any longer or shorter than my previous mats . but price , i hoped i could get more than year use out i t.t he mat heavier thicker than most mats . it also , least initially , perhaps little less sticky than some other mats i've used . once while i some trouble slipping mat during my practice , but this due sweat , i doubt any other mat would perform better this respect . money , i would probably go manduka mat . that what i've switched , i no complaints . benefit jade mat , however , it more ecologically friendly since it , i believe , constructed entirely out biodegradable material , which something you can't say most mats , including manduka	1

don't let name fool you . low max anything but low intensity . other reviewers stated , this workout not beginners , it truly advanced exercisers . said , i thoroughly enjoy this dvd it currently workout i most often . i love dvd several " premixes " so you choose just step aerobic segments , just power blasts , or two shortened versions aerobics blasts combined when short time ( or less motivated . ) choreography little tricky , but if you familiar other cathe videos you pick it up pretty quickly . unlike imax 3 , you get chance practice moves bit before you combine everything together- good those days when i'm little less graceful , shall we say . i also love fact cathe finally good lower impact workout doesn't skimp calorie burning . my knees thankful hopeful cathe more dvds this type . definitely crank up ceiling fan towel handy this workout	1

1 . eagle only sent one guy delivery . he couldn't move huge box inside house himself . i help him bit .

i fair amount looking before i bought this model i am very happy it . i became interested bowflex treadmills after consumer reports rated bowflex 7 series one if its best folding models . shopping amazon , i realized bowflex made 3 folding treadmills -- 3 , 5 , 7 series . online , these look very similar , 5 7 series longer tracks bigger motors . strangely , best source information these not bowflex website itself ( it * no * information 3 , 5 7 series treadmills -- just those crazy tread climbers ) , but rather specs amazon . consumer reports indicated best way buy treadmill actually see how machine felt . i agree . i managed find store 7 series stock . i impressed . 7 series rock stable very nice folding mechanism -- it locks up position drops down slowly when released ( great feature if you worry your kids getting crushed track accidentally ) . unfortunately , i could not find dealer carried 3 series try person , but it seemed like it would optimal very cost effective . i also tried several nordic track treadmills person . these seemed very unappealing walking decks ( sproingy !, bad way ) even high hp power machines , motor seemed power track very unevenly . i decided take chance 3 series would sturdy 7 series i tried --- i am very happy . amazon shipped thing super-saver relatively short period time -- very appealing ! it very straightforward assemble once i got thing place -- parts labeled assembly pictures really self explanatory . it also quiet machine deck * very * sturdy even big guy like me ( 200+ lbs ) . one quibble -- grip heartrate monitor could work better -- sometimes it not give reading after even 10 sec holding . also , aware deck not lock up position unless you reset incline 0 degrees . incline automatically resets 0 every time machine powered . i use machine primarily walking , this application it great , machine handles inclines relatively fast walking speeds no problem . i can't comment how well this machine compares others running fast . jogging it seems just fine . note delivery installation . this thing * very * heavy ( ~ 275 lbs ) . shipping company chosen amazon ( eagle ) great job . i called them prior delivery schedule when they would drop it off -- thats good news . bad news , they would only bring it threshold ( just inside house ) . i asked if they would bring it upstairs extra fee they said --" no way . " three calls moving companies estimate ~ $250-300 move it my entry up flight stairs -- this not two person job -- shipping box enormous ( 80 " 35 " 16 " ) . i solved this problem recruiting my father-in-law ( also big guy ) . we turned box its side , opened it , moved main piece ( track motor together ) itself . make sure not cut restraining strap , this keeps frame track held place making moving * much * easier . even then , main piece weighs 200 lbs serious work getting around corners . very glad point i bought shorter ( 56 " ) track ! overall , great mo-chine -- equal much more expensive models ! glad i managed avoid hernia during installation .	1

this mini stepper similar " impex easy step plus mini-stepper twist board " except electronic counter more basic ( it gives time counter only ) . package arrived pretty bad shape one piece plastic ( where you put your feet ) broken . i didn't want deal replacing it so i use some epoxy it works fine . manual assemble whole thing bad but it pretty easy assemble it . you setup height step very easily . if you want it more compact , you remove twister plate . i like small weights coming it . i recommend it !	1

i've bought three these laptop backpacks this best . well-made , well organized , lots space . seems durable , but haven't used it enough vouch it . protect my laptop physically its padded pouch , but also theft . how ? backpack doesn't yell out " i contain expensive laptop " - it looks like cheapo student bookbag . you can't beat price . highly recommended	1
this chain lock just amazing ! i very impressed how massive this thing . nothing , i mean nothing cutting this thing off . you read details contruction their web site . key lock easy operate , it seem get stuck bit , but intructions say wiggle or jiggle key place . so far , i not any problems . just careful though , because even though it comes protective covering , it may still scratch your bike . not it , you just careful it because its size weight . so far i'm very happy it i got it less $$ than local stores . i'm also very happy i got longer length , 64 " . 44 " one would too short	1

we bought this christmas gift our 2.5 yo daughter , who told santa he get her pink trike . she loved it , pink deemed right one , which good . we loved fact adjustable frame means it should last our ( very tall ) girl ages - she only second setting , despite tall average 4yo . fortunately , we decided assemble trike well advance christmas , screws hold seat place so badly burred they couldn't used . two thumbs up kettler spare parts division , who sent emergency express package replacements so santa could come through day . apart issue , assembly ok but not great , instructions could clearer ( we're both engineers so we're quite familiar tools building things ! )	1

i purchased this after seeing ad golf channel part because i like nick price his endorsement meaningful me . weakest part my game always driving . i'm solid iron player . but , not driving ball well really hurts your score . after little practice swing setter i really felt like i getting club back better position good wrist cock . i am reasonably strong easily make magnets click both settings 5 . when striking actual ball , my driving improved dramatically point where i used use driving iron today where i use driver . difference hitting ball 230 driving iron hitting it 280 driver . my last four rounds since using swing setter over 25% my drives over 300 yards . this makes game substantially eaier me since i now hit driver 8 iron instead driving iron , 5 iron par 4 . result , i am high 70 low 80 , drop off 8-10 strokes . difference going lower mostly short game some poor putting rounds kept me out 70 . but , shooting 70 makes golf fun . there no doubt swing setter helped my game quite bit . i not use short routine they provide , but rather just swing it get feel where my wrist cock should . both settings 5 , my tempo quick , much like nick price . but , swinging fast but smooth key hitting ball squarely far . overall , i am very impressed because i not particularly impressed leadbetter past because he seemed so technical . i just get up hit ball this aid helps just swinging club properly . if you , ball flies pretty well . five stars ! -- john del vecchio , dallas , tx	1
this thing worth twice what you pay it . like other reviewer , i purchased ton books , video , gizmos little improvement my game . i purchase refiner swing trainer it help me some degree but not cure my problems . i very flustrated give up golf when i bought swing setter . now i am getting lot more distance almost no effort great consistancy . i sometimes pull shot now but when i i know why . if you high handicapper you see huge improvement after first training session if you use drills provided swing setter . bottom line . buy swing setter before you waste lot money other training aids	1

material seems durable . 15 pounds ostensibly too light ki training . medicine ball also rather large thus takes away succient pinpointed targeting . good beginners	1
i impressed sturdiness construction this equipment , also variety ways it utilzed during workout . handgrips very comfortable during use . set comes little bag make it extremely portable . only drawback i normally work out friend , kit only includes one set grips/handles , though i believe you order additional set handles without ordering complete set .	1
i bought this system bodylastics let me tell ya .... this kick your buttocks ... ( get them shape ) . even though i gotten out shape over years i thought sure i could jump intermediate work out young lady included dvd disk during circut training part program . wrong answer . i thourghly humiliated myself gasping air , if you don't think some rubber bands ( well surgical tubing steroids ) can't give you work out you would wrong again . if you want get shape cheap you buy this product ... very high quality more than you would ever need . unless your body builder . honest . i owned total gym , i love it but they now cost almost grand or so better models attachments , which cost extra body lastics set same thing you . i really suprised pleased . oh i am now relegated all american cubicle forest work you use device attaches bands door top desk space where back wall your cubicle attaches get quite few specified exercises shown included manual . enjoy !!!	1
i feel this product provides excellent value occasional biker or hiker . while cycling i filled hydration bladder water ice . i also carried 32oz bottle gatorade storage area . there still plenty room snacks , keys , clothes etc . i purchased sony portable cd player/radio . it fits nicely special compartment headphone wires coming out slot top pack . my radio also remote which great when you don't want stop . chest waist straps hold pack comfortably yet snugly your body so it not bouncing around . one negative would report bladder hook . rhis what bladder suspends inside pack . i think it should latch or something hold it more securely . what i found when you take it off , it may slip off then it pinches hose which prevents drinking . i try keep velcro closes part pack close hook . this seems help . overall though i am very pleased my purchase .	1
very comfortable versatile air mattress camping , or water sports . heavy duty construction durable material attached pillow , reasonalble price , make this good bargain	1
i got this frisbee two years ago , i love it . i play pretty seriously 3 times week i really enjoy playing night this frisbee . it 185 grams so it soars pretty well without affected wind . only problem i it after couple years continuous use part holds batteries inside frisbee comes out light turns off when part becomes loose ( which happens alot now ) , but it easily fixable putting duct tape over it before playing . problem duct tape it makes it not aerodynamic it weighs it down , but i am happy i gotten good 2 years use out it . i highly reccomend it people wanting play frisbee night	1
we purchased this kayak few weeks ago enjoyed using it our nearby lake . initial use very easy . we it set up inflated within fifteen minutes , using hand pump inflation . note , kayak not include paddles , so remember purchase them well . kayak comfortably seats two people , room storage front rear kayak . we're using this stow lifejackets our boys . kayak includes two inflatable , removable seats which moved around or removed . we've found they very comfortable actually make rowing maneuvering easier . kayak also easy open close drain letting water out boa t.t he size this kayak makes it so easy using transporting . our 11 year old carry it his own it actually fit inside our van fully inflated . i don't plan taking kayak any rapids , but use local lakes calm rivers , it seems perfect solution	1

basic foam roller .. nothing much say it .. if you think you use it , buy it .	1
i really like heart rate monitor this t3 . heart rate keeps me informed just how hard or easy i am riding my bike . training effect function also very useful feature . t3 little complicated first , but constant use it becomes easier use . i like bike pod also i enter all data off t3 i sit front my computer	1
okay , so i am not airsoft expert can't really go into much detail this gun . first foremost this toy nothing more . it no need go fast or hard but believe its not fun get hit it . compared my ak-47 it shots fast very accurate . i kept short round burst found ' drum ' clip more useful . siliencer , scope , orange tip extention completly useless , don't need them . strap hold really well gun great weight . what i like this gun compared my ak-47 its size adjustability . i barely charged it my friend got some pretty nice welts his back . also i using . 12mm bullets this gun try . 2mm soon . i don't think difference great but adjustable hop makes up it .	1
this gun pretty high rate fire , long you give magazine good shove when you put it , then you won't any bb jam . this gun worth every penny ( but not much more than ) . it great indoor battles or small scale outdoor battles . hop-up very effective gun take any type bb you put there . truly get best effect hop-up , though , you should probably use high-polished . 12 gram bb 	1
product works well my cannondale made nicely . however i wish it real glass . all all good product . thank	1
this second vector i purchased . my first six year old one gotten beat up compass no longer works . watch large dial little bulky , but you get used it . you trade large easy read dial . watch more features than you use large instruction manual go it . it compass , barometer , temperature , altimeter . 6 hour barametric pressure history box nice warn you incoming bad weather . watch nice instrument , but i would warn against abusing it . it shock resistant , not shock proof	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	1
excellent product , shipping , service , could not asked more ... thank you so much !	1
cord-wrapped handle great idea , offering more real sword-like look well firmer grip . my hands tend get sweaty slip around bit long practice , particularly sealed lacquered finish most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed touch glue get it stay place ) . two-piece guard design nice enhancement too . though you really don't need guard all many applications it nice looking appears stronger than original . it still fairly cheap piece wood , compared ironwood version , but this price ( it $9.99 when i bought it ) you really can't go wrong . nice enhancement over basic bokken . i , however , prefer natural wood version this one it looks pretty bad once you start using it color scrapes off . nevertheless , if you want inexpensive practice sword this one recommended ...	1
we got four these tables last year our summer party using them regularly . none them arrived damaged all functioned well . we weren't expecting stainless steel sturdiness ( contrary they light easy transport , set-up ) so we not disappointed their " filmsiness " . this year party bigger , so we purchasing four more	1
just received unit . manufacturing quality very good . small , light compact design excellent . installing batteries snap ; unscrew retaining knob twist bottom cover 5 degrees align arrows off it comes . wire carry handle folds down flush lantern body . very slick . unfortunately , brightness leaves lot desired . i looking something i could bring up into our unfinished attic but this unit too dim . reading you lantern right next book even then it not really enough . this makes high/medium/low light feature kind gimmicky . only use medium/low would temporary night light kids room . blinking light feature ok but 2 second interval seems kind long . great lantern very light duty camping use , blackouts or other emergencies	1
my daughter got this one christmas . she wanted this one particular so santa claus brought it her . it lightweight so it very easy her peddle steer . she small side her age ( she 5 weighs 40 lbs ) but she no problem peddling this car ( she even pick it up turn it around ) . we larger one our 10 year old it very heavy ( too heavy pick up turn around ) . our son doesn't ride big one too much so our daughter one move up into when she outgrows little one ! i got it quite bit cheaper through different company	1
this one most wonderful products i purchased . it easy set up it very roomy . i love drink snack holders each kid . only thing it not good shade when sun shining right front . kids need hats or shades . otherwise i love it . i haven't chance use it kids bike , but i know it word great . i plan use it when they outgrow it tote my grocies around	1

this certainly convenient alternative wraps , but neoprene seems break down too quickly . level support protection under speed bag gloves , i think they're great ; but layer under full , 12 oz bag gloves , i prefer wraps -- these make whole show too bulky uncomforatble . recommended good , quick workout , but i think they also run bit small -- i average small hands , mediums too tight me	1

my son really likes it , it good starter bike him road ride , though it bit heavy road bike standards ( again , starter bike pricing key here ) . i wanted him able " try " road biking , it not popular , bikes his size ( 4'10 " or so ) under $500- hard find . i wish tires tiny bit more slick , they're hybrid road tires which means they more grip than road tires but not much mountain bike tires . gears made it look cool him , it got water bottle cage handlebar mounted brakes shifting , which made him feel like he cool bike like my more expensive road bike	1
cd shows how easily sharpen just everything edge . i've just begun my very dull knives found they need bit work medium sharpening stone . i thought getting coarse stone make things go quicker , but after i get them sharp i'm never going let them get this dull again ! moderately dull knife , this simple device make it razor-sharp just little effort . i'm excited get my scissors shape never thought i'd able put new edge my potato peeler	1
spyderco tri-angle sharpener best i've owned . it thoughfully designed , all components storing neatly carrying case . it essentially crock stick sharpener steroids . no clamping blades , no holding blades odd angles . if you hold knife blade vertical you put sharp edge any knife . it also scissors other tools but most people it primarily used knives . although manufacturer recommends using flat side stones , i am always hurry so prefer more agressive cutting edge . there lots cheaper sharpeners , but this quality product built last lifetime . one word advice- when you finished sharpening all kitchen knives , put note counter cautioning your spouse . it might prevent needless nicks or worse .	1

bought two sweetwater filter pumps take 4-day float trip ( one backup ) . i didn't need backup , but filter i use obviously getting close stopped-up end float . i probably could gotten more use it using enclosed brush clean it ; i didn't because float ended before i quite needed . summary : i'd recommend this product . i'd also recommend carrying backup .	1

so i own few cathe workouts she my favorite instructor , her workouts my favorite because they always advanced , i know i always get good workout when i them . this workout so many things i love ! drills ! no dancey moves , very basic step segments , but mostly plyo drills lunges ... high intensity sure -- so sure leave few days this workout . weight segments good , but if you wanting full body weight routine , i suggest jari love . but this good cardio weights mixed ... using ball , my first time , i say it pretty fun ! wall squats pretty challenging me , since i not them before- but i love challenge ! this hard core workout , you pleased ! but if you beginner , i not recommend this workout . this definately advanced	1

my son this trike since last summer . it heavy , study bike he rides every day . we keep it house all winter so he ride around house . it doesn't tip over easily ( but it tip over if my son messing around ) . i put it together myself it pretty easy assemble . i recommend this trike bigger toddlers ( age 2 up ) since it pretty heavy even most compact setting most kids under 2 won't able reach pedals . my son almost 3 still doesn't pedal consistently because weight bike	1

i this month now . goodits nice loud . my ears ring all day if i set it off . also it stand table or you could mount it wall . it very easy arm disarm . i it not go off wrongly once . cheap but works good . badthere no off button unit but might protection . you know so bad guy not turn it off . it turn itself off after few minutes nothing moving . they could put push button code it though protect it . biggest problem it you get up close arm disarm it . however , you plenty time so before alarm goes off . all all good product . main use would protect smaller rooms . you don't want this if you pets or kids walk around all hours night .	1
perfect 1-2 people . excellent build quality . wood handle feels very comfortable . even umbrella this large holds up well windy conditions . 62 " bit deceptive , since it measures circumference . i told gustbuster this standard measurement industry . actual size 51 " across tip ribs , 47 " across fabric ribs	1

tried out set today pool , works well . fins fit good even though i wear size 15 shoe . snug but not painful . snorkel could longer , but works suffieciently ... i've never snorkeled before i think i it down hour ... clear it water you put one hand over end near your mouth while you blow . works well enough you go down , come up , clear water , keep you head down . mask part set needs help , while trying adjust strap , it broke . so i took off plastic adjustment piece fed strap though hole where strap mounted it stays better . i think it works better after i broke it improvised . i think i'll other side too . fogged up bit too , but i bet there secret too ... overall fins a+ not too big , snug fit larger feetsnorkel b- easy use once you get hang itmask c+ strap adjustment lock sucks , better once you break it improvise price/value a- best deal i found lt ;$3	1

before i got cybertool swiss army knife christmas , i already owned two other swiss army pocket knives : one that now sold wenger canyon genuine swiss army knife , other which essentially same , but late ' 80s bsa logo , my early days scout -- both which small simple knives . i've used last knife almost 20 years now , proper care it maintained practically perfect edge smooth opening closure . i love it it reason i still go back swiss army knives : proven quality , i don't any real need try out other brands . i've never one big multi-tool knives however , but i must say i love cybertool . course it all standards , but real attraction addition screwdriver 7 interchangeable bits ( 1 regular , 3 double-sided ) . i lot pc hardware work honestly don't usually need more than one phillips-head screwdriver bits , but rest , even star bits , come handy if you've ever encountered security screws , which seems happen more more frequently . both screwdriver pliers , construction solid alignment perfect . all tools open close solidly , removable items ( tweezers , toothpick , ballpoint pen ) held firmly place . it always size larger multi-tool knives turned me off , but this one just right . big enough house everything i need , but not so large it feels heavy cumbersome my pocket . i gave knife rating " 4 " three simple reasons . first one translucent body . maybe i'm just traditionalist here , but i would preferred choice solid red or bare metal ; i just don't like translucent plastic . but alone wouldn't enough warrant lower rating . bigger issue wire snip pliers ; smart addition knife , but so small it difficult use . leverage there make cut , but depth isn't -- i two cuts , even 18 gauge wire . i only bring this up because there room make it slightly deeper wider . other problem placement hook . instead opening end knife top , it opens bottom hinge middle . placement top knife would allowed it twice long it , while giving greater mobility , hence , functionality . its placement swapped bottle openers i could see myself using it more often . overall , great knife , one i'd not hesitate recommend other hobbyists . while it specifically marketed " cyber " tool , it would also helpful general tool anyone working small parts	1
this great basic no fuss bike . if you read description it say it single speed ! how unfair these ratings , which buyer error , should posted!i'm glad i didn't listen them ! i absolutely love it!it just what i wanted ! good old fashioned bike like one i kid . it shipped fast arrived safely	1
recommended . rubber grip palm fingers helps lot , these gloves don't get ripped shreds few months like some others i've used past . built-in wristwraps great . ( if you don't like wristwraps , there slightly cheaper version without them .	1
these hard find locally me ( denver ) , usually priced higher than here amazon , least five ten bucks . i use xl gloves rather large hands general , so i can't comment other reviewers ' complaints decreased grip problems . i find these help my grip tremendously standard 45lb , 2 " olympic bars just too skinny my hands rip them up considerably . extra padding these gloves allows me entire bar circumference touching only glove material , namely rubber pads . when i wear my xl gloves curl my fingers around bar , leather fingers essentially go all way tip . after using these 4-6weeks ( 3-5sessions per week ) , i put them through wash dry cycle regular clothes , cause they get stinky , kinda like neoprene stinky but bit more sour . they never bleed , always come out perfect , almost like new -- any slack or looseness developed during use comes out they're tight again . i've 7 pairs these now , going back least six years . they last usually year or more hard use . typically stitch line gives out or velcro gives out ( i frequently loosen tighten throughout workout ) , but i've also worn down rubber patches loosened them enough leather surround glove isn't comfortable , although usually still usable . i suppose if i wanted go until they destroyed they'd last two years . far best wrist-wrap heavy lifting glove i've ever used , relative bargain	1
i hily reccomend this anyone who loves starwars . when i hold it its just like real thing it reacts every single time you move it ! it so much fun !!! please get it so you share my joy ! remember , it soooo fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =	1

this wonderful product if you cold neck or trouble holding it up . i heat it microwave put it my neck . it little heavy , but it also longer than others i've . price , i think , very reasonable . i love it . klutzy	1
i'm not exactly sure why it bit more expensive but she swears " it so much nicer " than her old one . i'll take her word it . blue very pretty neutral enough she loved color . my only complaint my 3 year old son pulled handle actually broke it . seems like it should bit more sturdy than , since he 3 . anyhow , it great scooter	1
first x6hrm i purchased very flaky , screen blanking out after button pushed . i return it , but found out there recall . new unit functions flawlessly great if you regular workouts you . altimeter , hrm timer saving data you download workout profiles your pc ( average software but functional ) overlay curves check progress during season or year-to-year . only minor complaint unit sucks down batteries . they're easy replace though , so buy few spares	1
assembly quite easy . bike fact " mostly assembled " . frame fits moderate taller riders best . everything quite smooth . front disc brake worth extra few ounces if you heavy needed extra stopping power . most disappointing thing this bike its rather heavy weight 37 pounds . otherwise , it fairly good bike good looks . okay if you paid no more than 150 200 it	1
i've back problems years , due spurs my spine . when i used roman chair years ago , my back always felt great . i love this piece equipment . it comfortable use , it easy assemble , feels stable when i use it , really gives me strength-building workout my back . i haven't tried all adjustments , yet , but i'm sure i'll able vary my workout quite bit them . value , comfort , adjustable , durable , overall great value price . i got ironman 3-station power tower apex/roman hyperextension bench , together price cannot beat .	1
i chose 35 mm version these fenders put my commuter , which i ride 28 mm tires . i looking full coverage fenders keep me my frame getting mucked up riding through rainy seattle winter . support bar attachment points very sturdy fender end , made entirely metal , not plastic , riveted fender . ( some older mt . zefal fenders i before plastic clips broke after few too many bumps fender . ) nyloc nuts secure support bars fender attachment points readjusted you get fenders centered over your tires , but i imagine their built-in locking effect wear off unlikely event you need fuss them more than several times --- nothing some loctite wouldn't fix , though . mudflaps flexible rubber very securely riveted ends fenders . your pant legs folks riding behind you thank you extra coverage . ( i hate catching up rainy day cyclists partial or no fenders . ) i try careful my bike , but fenders get bumped occasionally , these hold up wonderfully abuse , flexing springing back into place . i've put bus bike rack arm over front fender without any problem , though i don't often . fender surface smooth accepts stickers well , case you're into reflective tape or other safety/decorative measures . finally , i really dig planet bike devoting 25% their profits bike advocacy	1
i tried out air pod last weekend my first trip mountain this season . i never heard tech4o before , but they nice site some other really cool watches stuff it . i'm still not sure how it works , but it so cool . air pod tell exact second you leave top kicker measure your airtime until you land . me friend mine little comp see who going bigger off same kicker most air i able get 3.45 seconds . even when we didn't totally stomp landing or washed out little bit , air pod still recorded our air time perfectly . strap lot more comfortable than i thought it would light made it easy check my air even when it started get dark . last couple seasons all i hit rails boxes park , but those got old . getting air pod really makes getting bombing mountain huge airs fun again . i'm defintely gonna keep it my bag rest stuff i always bring mountain	1
i bought this stroller my twin girls , who almost 2 . they out grown their front-back duo glider , so they love side-by-side stroller . it pushes so easy light w/ swivel front wheel option , it perfect going shopping or walking . i like wheel lock event i want use it jogger . only reason i not give it 5 stars because " storage basket " underneath way under seats small . i get my knees reach under there put things get things out diaper bag not fit because there not enough " height " room basket bottom seats . i would also like stroller caddy go across top bar , place w/ cup holder storage keys , phone , etc . i not think you purchase one double stroller . other than , it great stroller good price . i definitely recommend it moms need side-by-side stroller , but need able " cruise " mall or take walks , because it easy handle . it also folds un-folds very easy .	1
i purchased this product after i saw commercial tv . first day i used it , i sore . next day wasn't any better . i've using it three weeks , combined healthy diet , i've lost 7lbs . my clothes fit lot looser . i am not person who sticks diets exercises but this i am able . instructor not annoying all . she moves very quickly through entire exercise , before you know it 20 minutes up . when i first got this , i honestly expected something completely different . when i use it first time , i honestly going send it back because i thought " what real difference little machine make ? " but it makes lot difference . it makes workout little more difficult you don't exercise much you would just regular exercise . i've read some other reviews this product claim bruising occurs , however i've using this product i not any bruises it . if you looking lose weight , gain energy , or just tone up , purchase this product .	1

this good gun overall . solid construction . most i get magazine 38 . it may hold more but given resistance i'm meeting 38 , i don't want force it . loading tube makes it easy reload . velocity significantly slower than advertised . it says 240 fps , but i would estimate it less than half . this my fourth airsoft gun , slowest . although it hop up , even it off pellets still rise considerably . 30 feet , hit waist , aim feet . it good starter gun first aeg , work well close combat . airsoft central provided really fast shipment . amazon estimated delivery date anywhere 31 march 5 april . recieved it 29 march	1
i this raider helmet i'd say same thing last review . i needed helmet went cheap one . it felt like it . if you aren't going use it much , then you probably get away it . but i would go hjc or shoei helmet . i just purchased hjc helmet it feels so much better . you get what you pay	1

just went through one week power outage buffalo here what helped : 1 . crank led flashlights great . i one gander mountain 3 leds you could select either one or three leds light . i also used two lightwave led flashlights , 7 led model 3 led model . both great lasted all week . my favorite freeplay indigo led lamp . worked great i carried it everywhere . candles ok but you can't walk them , they're dangerous , they melt faster than you think . 2 . get led headlamp hands-free , up-close work . i used princeton headlamp but got most use panthervision ballcap 2 leds embedded visor . put it morning it there whenever i needed it . 3 . radios must . freeplay crank radios great must . i also grabbed " safety cross 6 1 " crank radio/flashlight when i went somewhere - i wish it am but it just fm . two other great radios ge superadio , even better , grundig s350 . i like grundig best because you forget leave it run out batteries , great feature . ge superradio sounds much better i used it when i needed break emergency radio listen real music . ge uses 6 batteries grundig uses 5 buy they last forever . 4 . check out " basepump " . it sump pump operates off your house water pressure - no power required . it your primary sump pump or added " power out backup " . what great product . 5 . didn't generator , would nice , not sure i'll get one . if you , read directions know them cold . start generator once every 3 months . electrician rewire your box so you shut your box off power your entire house generator . if you not moving long time consider natural gas backup generator . if you want something cheaper portable everyone raved newer honda generators automatic cut back , low oil shutoff , etc . i think it honda eu3000is ? 6 . we trees down everywhere . i fiskars axe ( lighter head ) fiskars hatchet : both outstanding tools . didn't chain saw but i now , bought smallest sthil model . you really don't need much more than 12-14 " bar . 7 . keep some canned your pantry . fruit cocktail , soup , beans , tough eat them cold but they work	1

hi - i've used lot training devices past . polar hrm several models , garmin x01 gps models , stopwatches , even new nike/ipod combo this one really takes cake me . i scientific background work tech industry , but even though i understand math engineering , it not what i want when i am working out . i want simplicity , reliability features sit there until i ask them . i don't want get degree deviceology make it work each every time i'm out run , hike or bike . sometimes i am training marathon or triathlon - so i'd prefer my unit capable help me reach those goals - but it intuitive stay out way when i just want work ou t.t his model expand gps , or two different bike modules , or foor pod if desired . it also used smartbelt which work t3 during exercise , but belt stores advanced workout metrics so you could geek out pc/coach truly train like pros if you wish . unit well designed , thin , utilitarian yet not overly geeky ( i would take it off black tie event , but that all ) . batteries watch transmitter consumer servicable built training software joy use . yes , there five overall modes watch unit looks good ( so there no tiny text help remind you what buttons which ) - so you need read manual or get help someone else suuntu discussion boards free online . once you master basics how buttons affect software - you feel comfortable focusing your workout not operating device . i am really impressed how well unit works intelligence design went into interface , training software built - well how well display works . built logs also great 15 most recent workout , plus last week , last month last 6 months cumulative data	1
heater element slightly different design traditional heaters like this haven't changed thirty years . it flat lights easier . burner friction fit like all others come loose if you shake unit hard . you must use care handling liquid fuel these things . this heater smaller than big jon-e it would make more sense one these each pocket . one big jon-e inner breast pocket warm your whole body . my tip lighting heater run hot water over base heater preheat volatize fuel . once running these heaters rely heat feedback through case stay lit	1
i've my sollight bottle month now i'm impressed . light bright enough useful cap construction ( panel , battery , switch ) top-notch . here couple my " nits " and/or observations : 1 ] bottle polycarbonate , but not same thickness lexan used more trendy nalgene bottle . sidewalls this plastic flex bit . i haven't run into any durablity issues per se , but i wouldn't toss this bottle around like my narrow-mouth nalgene , either . 2 ] battery cap bulky ( um , it battery !.. ) which take some getting used when drinking this bottle . you really hold cap " flopping " back into your face . 3 ] light output cap isn't bright some other led lights i , but runtime can't beat ( 10+ hours ) . light good lantern task lighting situations such rummaging through bag or reading book . not so great lighting room , although output adequate see what you're doing if power goes out . more positive notes , bottle design super-wide mouth easy ice insertion wash access . also , this thing awsome conversation starter my constant companion booklight , too	1
more functional stylish than any other utensil . serrated edge like mini-knife , handy when you need cut something wild or work	1
ball comes kit seems pretty sturdy ( thick outer shell , should hold up well ) . i ordered 65cm ( because i already good quality 55cm fitball ) , but it seems small me - it isn't any bigger than my fitball honest . i note poster said it took over three days her ball relax enough fill it full size , so maybe problem ( although i got this friday it now sunday ... ) . workout starts alot lunges , which i absolutely detest ( i don't mind squats , but iunges bother my knees , even though i use proper form ) . once you get past lunges , rest workout seems pretty good . music kind bland boring - something livelier would nice .	1
actually quite well rounded good-hard video . it really works all your body parts , including arms , legs , back stomach . people video smile bit too much , but instructor not too peppy , which good	1
my daughter i each using hydracoach 2 weeks . they well-constructed pleasing eye . before i mention few problems i should state they achieved their purpose causing us drink more water so we continue use them . now some problems : when bottle first filled , first few ounces require extra effort sip . measuring device not accurate . bottle 22 ounces but you refill 2 ounces left . we both found drinking those 20 ounces registered 12-16 ounces display . we compensated this reducing our goals , e.g. 100 ounces drinking equals approximately 75 ounces display . i found ounces my display occasionally jump while bottle just sitting . one time it jumped over 500 ounces . two other times it jumped 5-10 ounces . my daughter not experienced these jumps	1

my original goal replacement rearview mirror compass temperature but installation would very complicated involving major disassembly vehicle . this unit performs well , if not better installation breeze ! compass actually reads out degrees appears very sensitive . wireless remote temerature sensor easy install ( many choices location ) works perfectly . new mirror i considering would cost more than twice much this unit . i am very , very pleased	1
just got back our first trip this tent , it performed admirably . set up quick easy , take down . we high winds rain , but tent felt solid not single drop moisture collected or leaked inside . overall , great product price we paid ( bought it sale ) . 5 5 rating indicates tent described performs all functions it claims . very roomy two , lightweight its size ( though it might tad heavy extended backpacking treks - still , light enough hike few miles ) . recommende	1
people who write negative comments this unit surprise me . i've used many ' ab-machines ' none isolate abdominal region good this . my gym one these i used it all time untill someone stole it , so i went ahead forked over 180 bucks it delivered . i mean oprah winfrey gives it her endorsement what more you need	1
i assume extreme underappreciated because i can't find reviews it . i've wanted bowflex decade but too cheap too busy seriously consider buying one . i finally pitched all cheap substitutes got real thing . i chose extreme because it smaller footprint ability all my exercises upright ( lying down bench 5:00 a.m. doesn't much my motivation ) . putting it together tedious instructions bit hard follow because pictures didn't always fit process but basic reading mechanical skills get you through it . training video pretty good , tom purvis knows his stuff . i surprised some exercises included basic program poster not included dvd . lame , but not issue my personal trainer background . what i like most extreme i remove seat several exercises sitting large exercise ball add stabilization challenge my workout . i also found i use extreme like rowing machine when i use exercise ball . it looks like extreme 2 , which set up so you don't ( thus cannot if you want ) change cable settings , probably wouldn't work exercise ball . not sure , but that my guess . long story short : excellent construction design , great if your workout space limited , pretty fast switching exercises , leg attachment worth extra bucks but watch specials because you sometimes get it added free . great overall deal ! downsides : shor t-t erm : tedious assembly , dvd doesn't cover all exercises . long-term : 210 lbs resistance isn't going cut it if you're serious strength trainer which means extra $100 two more 50lb rods .	1
these great use light weight . i use everytime i go camping or hiking	1
i don't own one these , but i use them gym every chance i get . i'm big fan trying new things stay shape , bosu trainer amazing ... balance crucial many different things , bosu great way prep snowboarding season , work surfing technique , simply train your core muscles ways you never knew possible . this should part everyone routine	1
i bought this pack my trek 6000 mountain bike . it just big enough spare tube blackburn airfix inflator/multitool . it small enough fit perfectly under back my saddle without any protrusion small enough not add too much weight . i chose velcro version because they tightened up closer bottom saddle more securely . other version seems hang saddle bounce freely under it . side note , i small aero wedge pack velcro my trek road bike because tube takes much less space . tight fit both carrying what i really need case flat , chain problem or necessary tweak	1
bar worked great held really well first set brackets , but held little too well second set . i can't get bar off anymore !!! telescoping mechanism stopped working . if anyone any suggestions ..	1
i read reviews this bar falling down , even though i weigh 220 lbs , i bought it anyway . long you install brackets , it hold up anyone . main thing i like this bar brackets hold bar any direction pulling . there only two downsides this bar . brackets stick out into doorway good 1 1/2 inches each side . also only one side bar foam grip	1
product very good comparison competitors .. much softer after 10 minutes workout- you forget they your wrists ... only negative point- bit too short around wrist , but i understand- they designed women anyway :	1
my son no problems doing push-ups this bar ... he happy this item	1
despite its awkward size , it comfortable wear what it supposed	1
treadmill high quality runs fine , although it bit loud side when running it . features settings exactly what we looking . however , warned free shipping . amazon contracts local shipping companies deliver product . i thought everything going good when shipping company called me set up delivery window . but , when they arrived , they laughed when i said i cleared way down steps back basement entrance where treadmill would placed . main delivery guy said " man what you trying , break my back ? " he then proceeded tell me delivery " threshold delivery " meant they would carry it threshold front door . he then said if i wanted it brought somewhere else , i needed pay extra make those arrangements ahead time . it got little ugly point told them their delivery slip said nothing which threshold bring it . so i gave them choice bringing it threshold my back door or loading it back up truck . they reluctantly agreed bring it back door . after they left , i realized how heavy this thing really . i estimated over 300 lbs . it took all i could muster get box over sliding door track inside house . even if you broke down box carried pieces one one , treadmill/motor portion device all one piece easily 200 lbs . only other pieces console support arms which weigh very little themselves . i ended up straining my back process bringing it . i am most angry amazon not making it clear delivery only door , not inside . also , amazon not offer any other shipping options time order . i definitely think twice ordering large item amazon again	1
i got 20 these project just hell it i loaded em all up shot through clip each . one so little power i couldn't actually feel impact 2 " away . seemed want shoot 90 degrees where you actually pointing . remaining 18 actually pretty spry . hell this amount shipping i paying buck gun ! buck toy gun removable clip working slide good enough right there , fact they shoot bonus	1

nice item keep your foam roller breaking down or getting flattened	1
easy assemble solidly built - good value money . main complaint i after months operation comfort seat - it bit stiff long sessions . beyond i've noticed central piston gets extremely hot during extended use ( 60 minutes or more ); sometimes this seems cause it slip or lose resistance . my experience this fixed merely letting piston cool checking resistance setting . i've taken using unit half hour increments avoid these issues	1
i purchased this month ago , it great so far ! it came out box mostly assembled , only took 10 minutes finish assembly . it really doesn't come any instructions use , but if you go online look rowing machine instructions , there 4 or 5 sites instructions help . foot pedals take little getting used ; i experimented found best thing wear shoes strap your feet tight-otherwise feet tend slip off pedal . i am trying come up way make back lip pedal higher so my feet won't slide off so easily , but haven't really come up anything yet . it not huge problem , just annoyance . after first or second session using machine , you learn little tricks keep your feet place , they seem make me work harder too since i am gripping more my toes well using my toes feet help my pull myself back start point . this definitely full body workout ; it made more difficult if you prefer shock adjustable ring increase resistance . i feel it most my legs , butt , back stomach , believe it or not . one thing i find you watch your posture this all other rowing machines , or you end up very bad backache end session . money , it good sturdy piece equipment , well worth money	1
i purchased this set goggles because they one best i used . they not leak . this my second set vanquisher goggles i likely purchase additional sets needed . only drawback i see anti-fog coating wears off very quickly . however , i think you find this every set goggles . speedo makes premium products these goggles live up speedo tradition	1
i've using these goggles while now . i've tried several other goggles fit silicone just right , very comfortable . i thought silcone would wear out , but it lasted me many swimming sessions still airtight ( although i adjust straps tigther because silicone straps loosening use ) . vision good but i've better view other goggles . it also fog up slightly extended use . anti-fog drops or spit fix up . i've used them swim lakes ( triathlon ) extended periods no issues . i've also noticed speedo quality all products i've tried ( silicone swim caps , swim jammers ) above par . i guess that why they're industry leaders . it great pair goggles amazon got great price them free shipping boot	1

we 2 inflatable convertible chair/sleeping bags our girls ages 5 7 ( 1 nemo 1 tinkerbell ) . we use them regularly . they light so girls move them around take them friends or relatives houses sleep-overs . nemo bag easy inflate cover removable so you toss it into washing machine . it bit struggle get already inflated bag back into cover once it washed since it takes 5-10 minutes inflate bag we don't deflate it after each use . our girls twin beds so we slide inflated sleeping bag under bed until we need it . this storage spot also helps keep all sorts other toys " hiding " under little girls beds too ! most time they convert bed into chair leave it infated their rooms . our girls love play video games use their chairs all time - it great feature . they carry them down playroom or living room ( if i let them ) . even 5 year old convert it bed into chair 1 minute . we very pleased these inflatable chair beds but reason only 4 out 5 stars first tinkerbell bed bad seam would not inflate . ( nemo tinkerbell basically identical design . ) we returned it without any problems company sent new replacement right away which worked fine . box you receive sleeping bag , inflatable bed , pump 1 time mini repair kit ( vinyl patch glue ) . if you plan buy inflatable sleeping bad , then purchase one like this convertible chair feature . it certainly worth it .	1

i bought eos replace small cateye light i used helmet light until it unexpectedly died me . i commute bike i got over 3,000 miles solid-on or flashing light cateye , but i expected more . eos costs same cateye unit uses same aaa batteries ( i prefer aa runtime , i'll put up weight - this only reason i didn't give eos 5 stars ) . however , eos ' light * bright * - nearly bright my 10-watt halogen main light . runtime quite good - i got over week commuting provided alkaline batteries before switching rechargables . light doesn't seem dimmer rechargables , unlike some other led lights . cateye required some ingenuity mount my helment - eos comes proper helmet mount addition handlebar mount . it clear light originally designed mounted headband , which fine me . battery compartment secured small screw knurled edge grip , seems reasonably waterproof . i've used it light rain no problems i don't expect eventual downpour cause any trouble , either . bottom line - i'd buy it again . this one winner	1

first off , these belts not " melt " fat your waist . if you notice , your " love handles " often times cool touch , which means there limited bloodflow area . belt such this one thing : help stimulate bloodflow area , which increase chances burning fat love handles . they - like everything else - totally useless if you not exercise maintain proper diet . also , loss inches not equal loss fat . measure fat loss area you need caliper , not tape . these belts no means miracle workers , but some benefit those who problems love handles	1

just got minimoto dune buggy kids christmas 2005 . kart very sturdy well made . real heavy duty tires take beating . actual replaceable/adjustable rod ends steering system just like more expensive gas powered karts . initial charge out box took bit longer but i believe it fully charged dead after 6 hours . ride time fully charged battery 45 minutes but considering speed this kart runs ( 18 miles hour ) those 45 minutes blast . very quiet so neighbors wont mind bit hours hours your kids spend buzzing up down your street ! highly recommended !	1
it inflates easy , very stable , reasonable storage space ( front under net behind seat ) . some issues i it hull valves tear easily when cold ( under 40�f ) . i've two places hull tear , two valves . good news super glue works amazingly well repairing both these ( when given enough time cure ) . this kayak given me 20+ good trips since september despite issues , still going strong . if you more money spend , i would get higher quality kayak . but if you're tight budget and/or beginner you can't beat this kayak under $100	1

i am jump rope nut . i knew guy who bad knees lost 75lbs jumping rope every day instead running . it always lingered my mind jumping could best way exercise . it burns more calories per minute than running less- yes less impact far than running . most folks don't realize . after bead rope reading up more , going boxing gyms , i realized speed rope trick . however , i also like gadgets . so , i got tanita digital jump rope . it ingenious- counts calories rotations . but it wasn't fast enough . it sells amazon , i recommend it well . so i got buddy lee professional metal , super fast rope . i love it , but it $40- also amazon . i just got this one- discovery rope love it . it takes little setting up then it fastest rope i . i find it very motivating . you see , addition counting calories , it also countdown timer . you set how long you want jump ( not counting time spent huffing , puffing panting til you become more conditioned ... ) it keep track . it also counts repetitions . it also half price very reasonable tanita model . timer very sensible , because you don't watch clock or even near one course when you're jumping you can't exactly look your watch . i highly recommend this . i've bought 10 them give friends well . only thing i wish they ( although it would add lot price ) pulse function built into handle beep option so you could gauge your intensity without even looking . ( hint : free idea discovery ! )but my heart rate strap watch work ok task . told you i love gadgets	1

i like this gun alot . first when i saw it i thought it wouldn't so powerful , i would just use it secondary weapon . it still my secondary weapon , but i still use it alot , sometimes i put awat my mp5 use instead . it holds dedcent sized clip pistol shoots 200 fps . go 75ft . its like sniping pistol ! only disadvantage when u try take out mag . fire fight it dosn't drop u pull it out , so waste some time fight . i also wouldn't use it my primary weapon because u 2 cock it every time , but if it semi automatic i would defenatly use it . bad thing it sometimes bb jam , then u take gun apart fix it . i think it good secondary weapon , if someone relatively far away ( 25-60ft . ) u snipe them it . it defenatly good buy	1
we bought this bocce set over year ago , we've very happy it . balls full 110mm , size heft cheap sets lack . after year heavy use abuse lots different environments , balls show very little wear . carrying crate well-constructed , seems made last . it little awkward carry any significant distance , though , so you might consider nylon carrying bag if you travel them very much . all all , wise purchase	1

this trike very sturdy - even more so than some other kettrikes our family purchased , which saying something . tough part already assembled you when it arrives ( yippee ! ) but i should say remaining directions kind sketchy . not difficult , but take some time really study pictures ( it german company so there not detailed written english directions ) ..... sometimes they toss part there it not easy see what they just or exactly how they it . anyway , so far it beautiful looks like long-lasting , well-made product . i am very pleased	1

these skewers very cost effective way reduce weight increase security . trading away " quick release " ability you cut weight cam lever . losing little convenience you'll save 50-80 grams only 15 bucks . one most favorable weight/cost purchaces made . you also gain little security . i might dispute ads claim it prevent theft , but i think it help lower your odds trouble . thieves who eye your wheelsets look easier targets than your bike . i always u locked my frame cable locked my wheels frame stationary object i still two fronts one rear stolen before i bought these . year since , i haven't any issues yet .

very high incredibly important monounsaturated fats !, nutshell : super food supplement like brewer yeast - lecithin - wheat germ or cod liver oil over 5 times more monounsaturated fat than polyunsaturated fat ! -- -- over 20 times more monounsaturated fat than saturated fat ! but that not all --- flax seed nutritionally complex food . flax seed contains very high concentration alpha linoleic acid ( ala ) omega-3 essential fatty acid plus fiber , lignan many naturally occurring vitamins minerals . increasingly , recent studies revealed flax seed help reduce serum cholesterol levels , fights cancer controls blood glucose levels . it important buy whole flax seeds then grind them : buying flax seed unground , keeps it fresh , retains all nutrients while shelf . however , it important grind flax coffee grinder before using , otherwise flax seed most likely pass through your digestive system intact , you not received benefits consuming them . it important avoid ground flax , since no matter how wholesome , fresh flax when it ground , it loses its nutrient value , turns rancid very quickly , even when purchased vacuum sealed container . essence , vacuum sealed container only useful if you use all flax soon container opened . course assumes it sealed soon it ground first place . fyi - traditionally , " golden flax " higher oil than ordinary yellow flax which traditionally higher fiber . bottom line : one several brands i consume daily - but i pick golden when i get it ! this " now flax " organic food supplement which enhance human health when used daily , truly excellent value . however , given choice , i would spend extra . 20 cents choose " golden flax " product because golden flax traditionally higher beneficial oils reason consuming flax first place .	1

this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big	1

you always hear reviews say " if i loose this i would buy one . " well , i bought one when model first came out it worked great more than year , then it lost cross country move . after few weeks i realized how much i missing it many every day tasks . i now purchased my second blur . they great knifes . only drawback you cannot sharpen it yourself serrated section , but get you any knife . spring assist functions great without any unintentional openings . safe , fast , useful . highly recommended .	1
perspective , my last pocket knife kershaw sapphire plain blade , so this step off beaten track . handle wide enough comfortable grip but slim enough my pocke t--t he sandpaper-like insets snag my jeans but hopefully won't turn out bad thing . this no means small pocket knife , blade large , but stable , good balance handle . if it wasn't slim it i wouldn't even try carry i t.t he speed safe little bit surprise , i thought it would lot less forceful than it . honest , i wouldn't bring this out public ( sapphire exciting butter knife ) because attention snapping it open likely attract . if anything , that only downside it -- it looks useful it . don't surprised if you get " even legal ? " reaction	1

i tried out air pod last weekend my first trip mountain this season . i never heard tech4o before , but they nice site some other really cool watches stuff it . i'm still not sure how it works , but it so cool . air pod tell exact second you leave top kicker measure your airtime until you land . me friend mine little comp see who going bigger off same kicker most air i able get 3.45 seconds . even when we didn't totally stomp landing or washed out little bit , air pod still recorded our air time perfectly . strap lot more comfortable than i thought it would light made it easy check my air even when it started get dark . last couple seasons all i hit rails boxes park , but those got old . getting air pod really makes getting bombing mountain huge airs fun again . i'm defintely gonna keep it my bag rest stuff i always bring mountain	1

i knew i would like bike , i've using identical one local gym . ordering delivery fast painless . assembly simple . then i disappointed find severe vibration low speed , which i thought might same noted previous reviewer ( flywheel problem ) . bike useable , but clearly not right . i contacted schwinn directly , who helpful , but not seem all knowledgeable bike or its problems . they immediately offered set up tech visit fix it , but called back next day say they no techs this area ( new mexico ) , only solution return it amazon . i said i'd see if i could diagnose problem first , which , not surprisingly , they thought just fine . after removing chain guard , problem obvious . chain so tight i'm surprised it hadn't snapped . poor quality control assembly line . adjustment chain tension flywheel end fairly easy , cured vibration . hopefully there no more problems . conclusions : these great spin bikes , seem well made , but quality control may issue . one two ic elites local gym warped flywheel delivery - manufacturing rather than assembly fault presumably . contrast , ten older schwinns few problems . lack any service availability here makes me wonder how easy it get warranty work if needed . i guess i should ask	1
this one my favorites ... perfect fit , nice details , great cargo water capacity . 100% satisfied highly recomende	1

it appears schwinn read minor problems sited numerous reviews older model 213 , fixed every single one those problems added walk through design . i lot research on-line well going around every large retailer professional dealer nashville , tn . based my research discussions i bought schwinn 231 sight unseen never happier . granted , i've only bike month now but so far this bike compares quite well bikes i tested cost 2-5 times what schwinn 231 costs . it completely stable , virtually silent , more importantly , it very comfortable . i'm really big guy , 6'3 " overweight . this bike fits me my wife . i just started working exercise physiologist who top line expensive gear his club ( cybex , lifecycle , etc ) . schwinn 231 recumbent bike he now recommending his clients in-home use . he even plans add few 231 his exercise floor . if you're looking biggest bang buck recumbent bikes , my research experience so far tells me schwinn 231 doesn't any competition it current price point $550 . ps : cycle sport fitness bike $550 free sh	1

actually you can't judge this flashlite till you get your hands one them , even day light it working , let alone dark , it just lights lights . batteries quite expensive , but quality great . i love i	1
light performs advertised noted earlier reviews . my sample comes month #2 production . early manufacturing issues seem ironed out , because i can't find anything negative this light . it bright low some very expensive 1x123 lights i bought only few years ago . they served me well , but fenix my new edc . when incandescent flashlights first invented i'm sure they very expensive ( adjusted today dollars ) . design manufacturing improvements eventually gave us well-made reliable maglites ( similar other companies ) bought cheap every street corner today . just several years ago well-made high output led flashlight cost over $100 . fenix p1d-ce milestone our path pricey beginning ultimate goal - pocket size light multiple output levels , puts out tons brilliant white light while never needing new bulb , affordable . p1d-ce deserves milestone status because it twice bright costs half much , while still well manufactured , compared lights available right before its release . performance price led lights continue improve ? you bet it . right now , though , p1d-ce benchmark this class lights . buy it if you need $70 spare . buy rechargeable rcr123 setup power it if light see frequent use . if your service needs more occasional then use standard 123 batteries . buy them $1 - $1.50 each bulk web instead $5 each locally	1
you amazed how bright this little flashlight . i own several led flashlights this one beats them all hands down . this beast powered 1 cr123a battery 5 settings . primary , maximum , low , strobe , sos strobe . fenix claims 50,000 hour life cree led . my only gripes flashlight . it rather expensive but worth every penny . holster fairly cheap ( nylon elastic ) . unusual way switch settings . twist bezel turn primary light , twist it off again quickly change next output so . these all very minor no effect my rating . it very top notch flashlight . there rumors loose threads bezel which could cause water leak but mine not this problem . final note . if you purchase this flashlight you should also invest protected rcr123a kit , it'll save you fortune battery cost . also if you plan hook it up your keychain get natural color way scratches won't show up so easily .	1
pocket heater came quickly chelsea watch worked great out package . it made japan quality look it leads me believe it work long time . it gives out enough heat keep my hands warm last full day or half day , depending how much fuel one puts . lights easily stays lit . i love it	1
bought this way exercise through cleveland winters . easy assembly . owned it two weeks . easy work up swea t.t wo negatives : fan louder than i anticipated there no way disengage it necessitating high volume music/tv while rowing . polar heartrate monitor not report accurately when exercising . heart rate ok rest , but movement it jumps all over . overall - well worth $699 - let hope it lasts	1

it so nice find product fits exisiting products . 72qt marine cooler hard find this summer , but amazon it . it replaced old cooler seat our boat perfectly	1
stepper tough use first but that probably because i'm out shape . i've used it several times but not regular basis . only probably i it hard maintain your balance times . otherwise , it great little exercise medium price i like it because it small enough put away anywhere	1
these weights adjusted 1/4 lb increments , they don't scatter little metal granules like bell wrist weights i used use . you might consider wearing thick old sock under them wrist ... [ cut out toe ] prevent chafing ... since terry cloth lining good , but not harder edges	1
i got tired wearing wristwatch , but still need know time , so this good idea . i bought product soon it came out , so i used mine over two years now . i attracted altimeter , but found it wildly unreliable : either or my desk going up down berserkly . my desk altitude 270 meters , but i get readings everywhere 240 meters 350 meters . i wrote company asking it , their reply boiled down : " live it . " also , thermometer usually very slow react big temperature changes . it very good slight variations places like closed room , but if you go indoors outdoors , plan waiting half hour learn outdoor temperature . `current weather ' display always good laugh . overall , i enjoy this , but i hope their next model better . ps : shortly after i wrote this review , clip broke , replaced twenty bucks . may 2006 .	1
works advertised . i've only used them month so far , but they certainly make lifting much more comfortable . i expect them last least year or two ; when they " burn out " , i'll most likely buy pair .	1
my personal opinion these tapes cued extremely fast . i hard time keeping up , even after several attempts . grrr . very frustrating beginner seeking inspiration . very disappointed ! pricey item down tubes .	-1
i using transfirmer series three weeks now say while it potential great product me , i wasted my money . i exercising regularly personal trainers four years excellent fitness , so i am not new rigorous exercise . i thought i could save my money use these dvds home instead . while weight portions videos great , step aerobic portions difficult follow . what would make it easier follow if instructors more repetitions same move rather than constantly adding steps switching back forth moves . there nothing dvds help you slowly clearly learn steps prior beginning work out . also , camera angles not anything help beginner learn moves . they claim steps easy follow , yeah right	1

this recent purchase gift . i mine 2 years almost daily use -- doing maintenance around my ( rural ) property -- yard work equipment usage maintenance . it very reliable under hot , cold wet conditions . i use low beam ( 3 led ) most often . however , it not take long light output 3 led get noticeably weaker using alkaline batteries . high output long range single led seems last longer even when 3 led light diminished . i've switched nimh rechargeables which serves me better since i charge batteries often ( not put up using weaker light output until i close exhausted alkalines ) . maintenance this headlamp , i occasionally wash submerge whole flashlight sink clean straps . ( i wish straps removable so i just put them washer . ) recently , one 3 leds started blink ( like strobe light ) then died . i sent it back princeton tec they sent me new one immediately . i am quite pleased this flashlight .	1

i've strider 3 weeks now am very impressed . assembly not too tough instructions very easy follow . total assembly time ( while watching world cup ) 20 minutes . machine itself sturdy enough considering it folds up . i am 195 lb . 6 ft . guy it works just fine me . it very well designed so there very few moving parts could possibly break . it very quiet display refreshing its simplicity . it tells you time you working out , number strides , your heart rate approximation calories burnt . that it . those who complain it not give intense enough enough workout , you looking wrong machine . this strider not elliptical devise meant triathletes . if you want killer workout , you need $900+ elliptical or join local gym . all i wanted machine i could pull out closet my office , get 30 minute workout before heading home end day . this suits bill just fine	1

we bought this when our daughter 3 months old she still loves it over year later ! she uses it so much we've almost worn it out ! first i thought mechanics kind loud , but i think either goes away little use or we've just gotten used it . now it not noisy all . best feature projector . it not too bright or too busy . all songs soothing , even bird chirping soft . it 3 volume levels , but we've never used loudest one . we replace batteries every few months or so . only thing i wish it remote control turn it afar so she doesn't get up . but other than it perfect . but it got long play it , so usually she asleep time it . we've got ocean aquarium ( older version ) grandma house , it okay but it doesn't projector bubbles really too loud distracting . ** way ** this not $99 ! we bought ours $35 i think . i don't know why amazon listing it so much	1

85 " mat probably best 2 different situations : if you tall like me ( 6'3 " ) you don't mind carrying some hefty extra weight around class , or if you want yoga home ( or wherever ) you don't need ever move this mat . it heavy ( like 10 lbs ) because it so dense - but good thing ! it solid mat sense when you twist your feet your mat doesn't bunch up like thinner mats . it also gives you great padding hard floors . it obscenely long - which gives you room stretch out , also additional advantage giving you some extra space crowded studio - call me selfish but that nice bonus . it very sticky unless you really sweating , but point you would probably towel . i use this carpet hard floors it works great both cases . yes , this mat expensive , but didn't you just spend $100 those shoes little shox back ? you should consider your yoga mat just important - buy yourself best	1

i gave this stroller 4 because there no parent consol . other than it handles very well	1
this stroller great !!! i researched double joggers quite some time not big budget some higher-priced ones , but find this one got great reviews . i just received it mail few days ago let me tell you -- i love go walking now ! i put both my kids it ( ages 2 1/2 years 5 months ) no longer put my 5-month-old snugli carrier . also , it makes walking my dog easier , he just walks right next it . it nice , smooth ride , barely feels like i am pushing any weight . it folds up nicely fits into my suv perfectly ( honda pilot ) . it also little soft console water bottles , keys , etc . canopy nice large covers them sun . my kids really enjoy riding it , it roomy great 5-point harness restraints . only drawback i see angle seats ... i them reclined forward far they go they still angle where my kids seem lounging back . my 5-month old not mind ; however , my toddler gets antsy sometimes wants sit up . most part , though , they content entire ride don't try sit up . this stroller perfect fast-paced walking or strolling around . it probably also good mall or other places , but i know after 45-60 minutes sitting back my toddler reach her limit want get out ! luckily , i different stroller those occasions !!! i highly recommend this stroller -- you don't spend fortune get great stroller	1

i've jansport fan over 20 years owned various backpacks packs , i always come back jansport . you just can't beat quality durability jansport . i say without doubt odyssey outstanding pack what it designed . it tons room , well thought out , loaded features , most importantly , comfortable wear even fully loaded . i use if commuting every day frequent travel work . i load it up my laptop , extra sweater or light jacket , my portfolio still plenty room all those extra things you need when traveling . if you're looking high quality pack that versatile , loaded features comfortable , look no further .	1

this truely amazing piece equipment back body health . i suffered herniated disc while i pregnant , some difficulty " taking it easy " my back post-partum i little children home take care . after spending many hours $ chiropractor , i realized traction very healing process keeping spine alignment disc properly hydrated . everything you read positive healing aspects inversion true . i opportunity use teeter hang ups ankle release while , i must say i am extremely pleased f9000 . although quality both ankle release table rachet system same , f9000 worth extra expense . ankle release harder release because it requires stronger pull handle . plus , you reach all way ankles after good inversion stretch . anyone needing inversion because stress or injury back , i just don't recommend bending ankles . ankle release requires two movements - one hand needed pull ankle handle release , other hand needed lift piece away enough get your feet out . rachet system completely different . rachet system push button releases hold ankles , same hand , you simply move it away you . not only you not bend all way your ankles ( just knees ) , it also simple , easy release . i wondered if i wanted spend extra money rachet system , but now i tried both , i no doubt extra expense more than well worth it	1

this device replicates , less stressful manner my opinion , dumbbell wrist curls wrist extensions . while it may not provide pure strength gains dumbbells , it good way hit same muscles less stressful manner . there occasions over years , after hurting my elbow or wrist whatever reason , dumbbell wrist curls extensions caused pain trying . fact i got this valeo product very reason . i immediately able use it without pain . people tendonitis know what i am talking qhen i say it not take much aggravate it , once it back , it makes lfe miserable . this valeo device you still work your forearms/grip strength , yet so within your game pain-free . i very , very happy this product	1

i bought eos replace small cateye light i used helmet light until it unexpectedly died me . i commute bike i got over 3,000 miles solid-on or flashing light cateye , but i expected more . eos costs same cateye unit uses same aaa batteries ( i prefer aa runtime , i'll put up weight - this only reason i didn't give eos 5 stars ) . however , eos ' light * bright * - nearly bright my 10-watt halogen main light . runtime quite good - i got over week commuting provided alkaline batteries before switching rechargables . light doesn't seem dimmer rechargables , unlike some other led lights . cateye required some ingenuity mount my helment - eos comes proper helmet mount addition handlebar mount . it clear light originally designed mounted headband , which fine me . battery compartment secured small screw knurled edge grip , seems reasonably waterproof . i've used it light rain no problems i don't expect eventual downpour cause any trouble , either . bottom line - i'd buy it again . this one winner	1
just what you need where background noise little more than what you want yell over extended periods time . noisy area , plan able heard well only within couple hundred feet . well worth $40 heard while saving your voice	1
read previous buyers comments . however , i still purchased this my 7 y/o . because said problems , i made sure read instructions prior use . ( yes , i am man so y'all know how hard . ) anyway , most difficult part hit-a- way pole putting it away . after 1-3 minute set up time , my 7 y/o needed 5 swings get hang this product . 30 minutes later he my 16 y/o figured out how they both could use it same time . ( helmets suggested ) 2 hours later i literaly pull my boys away it . two points address previous buyer : 1 ) if you attach ends cable pole correctly , legs not cause any interferance . 2 ) if you not hit ball correctly , it not return , ( unwind ) , properly . i would not call this problem , but training/use issue . my sons quickly learned bad hit/swing very obvious , which lead them practice master proper hitting technique . ( short , ball failing return not caused any part device , but improper hitting technique batter . ) it very well built product it easy set up , take down store . because its construction it heavy product , but wheels aide ease its placement storage . i would recommend this product . heck ! so derek jetter reggie jackson before him . ps ... i set it back up took few swings myself . ok , whole lotta swings , but don't tell boys their mom pull me inside get me stop . remember how kid again , some patience , fun play ball !	1

i recently ordered this watch amazon companion ltt observer wear field . while observer more updated model they both share very similiar features ease operation . my first recommendation you order this amazon.com wary same item offered " market place sellers " . time i initially placed order amazon.com out wait estimated 3 5 weeks . since item also offered seller amazon referral system i placed order wound up wrong watch ; turns out market place seller didn't carry black face model . fortunately amazon got supply shipped my watch within 24 hours .... good service . black face little hard come . now then , watch itself . first all it big ... but very light ; almost light titanium observer i . larger face makes it easier read suunto apparently gone back leather ( waterproof ) band , which i prefer . functionally , watch full blown time keeper ( non gps ) navigation system including stop watch/chronometer functions , accurate altimeter , barometer digital compass . both compass altimeter accurate i've found analog portable units . alarms sufficiently loud ( unlike only chink observer ) my only criticism back light weak compared observer , but fault doesn't draw anything away 5 star rating . add user replaceable battery ( suunto makes kit includes battery , water/dust seal new cap ) , intuitive operating system you ultimate back country time piece . suunto first offer this type time piece , my opinion , still offers best . i've used their diving computers field compasses years am fan company many products . i don't think there clunker catalog	1
i bought this my 20 month old son daycare because his school children take naps sleeping bags ... it little more money than your average small sleeping bag target , but it well worth it ! it so soft , well made , cute pattern , thick ... i highly recommend it ! also , it says only hand wash it let it air dry ... i hate mildewy smells so i just threw it washer then dryer ... it came out perfect ... dried completely ... my son loves it too	1

studying reviews amazon elsewhere , i narrowed my choice this stamina 15-4600a bike or similarly priced lifecycle . i hard time choosing , could gone either way . i also considered recumbent bikes costing far more . i've seen some misleading or exaggerated reviews before , but guess what this bike really good ! you probably considering paying hundreds more , because you skeptical something this cheap could very good . i think 90% people this definitely good enough ! it compact low , which means we comfortable putting it our living room where bigger bike would eyesore way . it also comfortable ( wide seat/good handle grip ) sturdy ( doesn't wobble use ) . there low gap space seat pedals , great mobility impaired people so they don't high step straddle it they would most bikes . however mobility impared people anything pull themselves up this bike since everything low . there nothing obstruct your view , which makes this great place front tv . i think this fantastic buy , i encourage you stop looking just get this one .	1

i recently purchased - returned - bowflex ultimate 2 i wanted convey just how disappointed i whole experience . my equipment arrived january 10th . i opened boxes , i realized not only there no assembly instructions , there weren't any user instructions how modify machine different exercises . i contacted bowflex immediately told mistake made , but i could download assembly instructions website . i also told user manual would sent me . one week later january 17th , i contacted bowflex because i not yet received user guide because during assembly ultimate 2 , i noticed one plastic balls prevents cables coming off cables broken . representative i spoke again pledged send me user manual replacement ball so i could use machine . i asked if they could overnighted because machine unusable me broken ball ( which allowed cable pull through ) without users guide . representative said she would expedite order but she could not overnight it . she told me she could not tell me certain when it would arrive . end day , friday , january 19th , it apparent me items would not arriving before weekend it would more than three weeks day i ordered machine before i would able use it . it very frustrating me bowflex would not overnight these items so i could fix use machine soon possible . these items not arrive until 7 days later , making it full month date my order before equipment would functional . these reasons , i elected return equipment bowflex . i expecting far better customer service something cost over $ 2,000 . making matters far worse cost me return items bowflex . using ups bowflex recommended knowing cost bowflex ship items me $200 , i expected it cost $200 ship items back washington . however , because all returns must go virginia , cost ship items via ups ground original boxes virginia $489 - more than double original amount . i'm assuming two reasons explain cost difference 1 ) bowflex must get some sort discount ups all its shipping traffic 2 ) naturally , it more expensive ship california virginia than it ship washington . regardless reason , my bowflex ownership experience only made worse fact i spend 25% original purchase price ship item back . this whole experience made it very difficult me ever anything good say anyone my experience owning nautilus equipment .	-1

where would roy rogers without trigger ? where would lone ranger without silver ? pecos bill without widowmaker , or doc holliday without big nose kate ? indisputable fact every cowboy needs horse ride . what price gasoline oats these days , it any surprise many us urban cowboys shifted two-wheeled variety equine transportation ? other day -- just whim -- i amazon search see if anything would come up when i entered name style my deeply beloved bicycle , huffy " good vibrations " model cruiser . how exuberantly surprised i find myself staring photograph my lovely , faithful " steed . " it still made . hooray ! " classic " cruisers still i'm still astride mine ( even if " fenders " long gone . ) let me tell you my bike : i bought my huffy " good vibrations " cruiser pep boys downtown santa monica , california circa 1980 . ( it looks identical one pictured here . ) i've probably logged over 144,000 miles mine . i used pedal it every day before work beach bike path exercise just pure joy it . my favorite ride took me underneath santa monica pier , through human carnival venice beach , around boat slips marina del rey , sand through el segundo , manhattan beach , hermosa beach , redondo beach , outskirts torrance , then back again . or put it more succinctly : my favorite ride heaven earth ! note : barest minimum maintenance , i'm still riding " good vibrations . " yeah , uh-huh , that right . 26 years after buying my bike ( approx . same price it offered here ) it i still best friends ; i'm still planting my " cushions " its seat still pedaling canals , horse track , or grocery store , or work . now , how many years you driving your car ? think you'll get 26 years out it ? you get 26 years out your job ? how `bout your marriage ? yeah , what i'm saying " good vibrations " last last ... but i real scare recently : bearings doohickey connects thingamajig gotten wrecked handlebars loose whatchamacallit . ( rode it way over year anyway . ) finally took it bike shop " homeboy " tells me throw my best friend into dumpster . " homeboy " says it can't repaired . according " homeboy " bike basically junk when brand new ; fork could break me any moment put me hospital . well , certain " good vibrations " could never hurt me , i put my buddy bed my truck drove it phoenix , airheadzona santa monica , california one last beach bike path ride . i figured if it broke me way , i'd just leave it beach r.i.p. ( rust pieces ) . well , we made it santa monica pier torrance back , just like good ol ' days ! other riders could hear us comin ' up `em because " good vibrations " loudly going " squeeek - kreeek - rattle - groan ! squeeek - kreeek - rattle - groan ! " other bikers probably thought he crying pain , but i recognized those sounds what they really : singing ! joyful singing ! back home , good friend melanie suggested i take " good vibrations " see nice , old gentleman who owns roadrunner bike center glendale , az . two weeks later only $34.59 lighter , " good vibrations " good new ready hit canals again soon weather cools down ! ( why dirty dog first bike shop ! i think " homeboy " just wanted sell me some newfangled , multi-geared " horse . " ) only one thing concerns me : my bike clearly labeled " huffy - made u.s.a. " but nowhere this product page i see country origin mentioned . " good vibrations " still made here , or they now produced china ? i urge you investigate before buying because " good americans " don't financially support coummunist countries utilize slave labor , threaten their neighbors , imprison religious , force abortions their women . right ? sometimes only poetry express cowboy love his " horse .

i bought this pack substitute bulky roller bags . it works great but if you stuff it maximum you may compress it down bit some overhead racks . separate compartments give you plenty flexibility it accomodate shirt folded received most laundries . padding excellent weight distribution makes it very easy carry . i also use this day pack hiking although it more space than generally needed this . organizer section works well carry cell phone , pda or any other miscellaneous items . construction excellent it versatile enough accomodate wide range uses . great value price charged	1

please please please steer clear this item !!!! listing advertises two 10 lbs weights , however you'll actually receive two 5 lbs . weight sets . these weights actually sand , rather than iron tubes you get most other sets . i received set ruptured leaking sand so i return them . but it best because advertising these misleading anyway . set bulky not particularly comfortable . furthermore , these can't all durable either . finally , these most expensive 10 lbs ankle weights i've seen thus far . you'd better off anything other than these	-1
this machine gives you really nice workout , i like it lot . instructions little lacking don't fooled , there lot assembly involved ( takes 1.5 hrs total unbox assemble ) but tools all included which terrific packaging very thoughtful well . i like everything unit except some connection points where arms attach pedal get clicky loud times ( there no bearings all connect this portion , just metal metal washers which my opinion makes 2nd rate connector type ) heart rate strap works poorly until you work up sweat but after it great job ( i try moisten it first but sweat seems work best ) computer great job tracking results too . $1000 it really nice piece equipment but definitely not health club quality , it home use only	1
all home-based elliptical trainers , this smoothest ' ride ' . it one priciest in-home ellipticals , but definitely worth it . we ordered on-line through amazon -- free shipping no tax . came promptly our door we assembled it fairly easily	1
this dartboard attractive fun addition game room . wooden cabinet very handsome - it nice finish well-constructed - actual dartboard itself seems top quality . my one complaint darts come set , while highly servicable , somwhat clunky flights frequently fall out . however , you could remedy this buying slightly better dart set - old darts used kids or parties . overall , this would serve player medium experience quite well .	1
i've using my harbinger 1260s approximately three weeks . padding 1260s took little getting used . majority my weight training machines rubber padding grips . this makes gripping harbingers little awkward first , but i got used it after couple workouts . only time tell whether these gloves hold up well my old nikes . i used those over three years ( they lost ) lifting weights 3 times week	1
if you into weight training , these great gloves . well padded , washable , flexible , great value price . 3 quarter length fingers provide extra protection while maintaining freedom your fingers	1

i ordered this bike monday , received thursday even though i free shipping !!! today friday , after riding bike , i am very impressed . my boyfriend i put it together last night it took 1 1/2 hours . i bought this bike after reading reviews , yes instructions sucked but we knew going . we use few our own tools make sure we really tightened bolts . like previous reviewer , we also confused first rear front stabilizing bar , parts really should numbered this purpose , illustrations not help much . but once we got past , it pretty much breeze put together . i've ridden it today am very impressed !!! bike so quiet you almost can't hear it , i really can't stress enough how quiet it , someone could sleep 15 feet away you not hear it ! i am 5'6 , lengthening bike out very comfortable me . i love everything this bike , although i agree seat could little more cushioned , but that okay . price bike , i would definitely recommend it !! i doubt you would find better bike under $200 . great quality , it provides good workout	1

got it , love it , loved price . cd best buy , they right . if you don't want drop 2-3 grand top line , drop 800 bucks this enjoy . i've used it nearly year . i've lost 45 pounds , combined sensible diet . i put it tv ; it quiet , functions great . pros : price , features , lightweight , programscons : led lighting , not stable higher priced items ( probably not big deal unless you weigh over 300 pounds ) , heart rate monitor definitely off ( i'd say it 10-20% too low)in my years internet shopping , i rank this buy my top 3 . enjoy	1
very solid construction , feels like something you would find top gym . great variation resistances , i yet manage anything more than half way up scale . built heart rate monitor works great fairly good variety preset programs chose . if you looking robust system you should definitely consider this bike . it pretty heavy so moving it around especially carpet not easy even though there wheels built into one end .	1
i agree most reviews . some stated their box upon delivery bad shape . they must corrected deficiency , mine came pretty good shape . one gentleman indicated hearing loud clacking sound when peddling eventually went away . i too noticed loud clacking sound still awaiting day it goes away . someone stated bike isn't geared people under 5'4 " . i agree shorter people going need some propping . bike sturdy . instructions clear . overall pretty good bike . seat semi-comfortable . i really like computer monitor . it monitors distance , heart rate even programs . i took star off due loud clacking sound i'm hoping eventually go away	1

i like bike lot , but i find it extremely loud not very smooth . best part resistance . i find resistance much more realistic than magnetic or other kinetic resistance methods . you work hard you pedal , just like real bike . only problem i i don't use it enough . seat isn't very comfortable , it not horrible , but it not comfy . noise detractor . my bike seems lot squeeks creaks , but they're generally drowned out noise fan . i probably should checked out one smaller fan , but i researched all this online . i'm 250lbs so i hope it holds together . so far so good , but time tell . it old school workout machine . if you're looking something effective , but not refined , this it	1

bought this knife friend . it small sharp . but mainly bought it looks , very bright colorful . though i think this would ware away pretty fast if put much use .	1
perhaps best most useful pocket knife you	1
this knife wonderful ! i'm one last people get something looks this " girly , " but there something it appealed me . it looks cute innocent , pinkish rainbow sheen ( mine lot more green blue than picture ) , but it wicked sharp . since it spring-assist , it opens lightning quick deployed instantly opening boxes or what-have-you . i like carrying mine pocket clip , but it comes safety lock so you carry it your pocket without fear it accidentally open . very essential times when i'm wearing dress pants can't knife showing . it very small though . it perfect kids or someone like me who very small hands . though i problems opening knife thumb stud . it just small enough my thumb slide intercept edge blade . fortunately , it index-opening one flick my index finger , i open it . i carry larger knives my jeans pockets daily basis , but if you need something discreet stylish , you can't go wrong ken onion rainbow chive . it certainly looks inconspicuous , but it incredibly useful many applications	1
this our handy tool avoid our kids bouncing off walls , instead they bounce count . its sturdy but portable enough move easily around house	1
former 2/75th ranger , i found these radios satisfactory what they . i only use it when i need able speak wife while we're working projects ( no , i don't make her transmit properly over net , but i tie it off her body ... lol ) , but these sx800r radios allow me talk her across city block ( approx 200-300m ) downtown las vegas . means trees , homes , apartments , townhouses shopping center us ... just not loud static/white/pink noise . that downright impressive walkie-talkie " toy " radio . there no battery failures/issues . follow directions don't turn them first 16 hours charging ... problem most , i'd bet . belt clips fine , no breakages there either . there lanyard hole you tie them off , so that non-issue well . if i gripe , it not radio , but need accessory mic earpiece , it pita hold radio up like walkie talkie receive transmit because my hands usually full . personally , i'll fix issue quality throat-mic ( whisper mic hooahs ) acoustic ear tube setup ... or maybe secret service hand-mic setup . i digress , but overall , after reading all reviews prior motorola frs/gmrs online , i'm satisfied sx800r , especially price ... almost free , considering my other options . -rlt	1

this great toy small child . i just got it my highly energetic daughter 3rd birthday , she loves it . it great bonding playtime , too . she always wants me jump her . best all , i'm burning calories while we blast !! i gave it 3 stars educational because it obviously not teaching alphabet or anything , but it teaching balance coordination spatial reasoning . since it less than 2 ft tall , she doesn't get hurt when she falls off it ( she ... several times ) . she just giggles climbs back . i would highly suggest enclosure child who big enough really bounce , but small child , i don't think it requirement . it no more dangerous than falling off couch or something . all all , well worth money !	1

i disagree previous reviewer . if you want truly accurate reading while doing exercise you need model strap . strapless model requires you stop activity read results . reebok silver great value what it supposed . instructions quite clear if you follow them you get accurate reading . i am very satisfied	1
this hitting screen works very well such portable screen , sportsrus price good value . construction high quality . refolding process takes some getting used , but works fine once you've it few times . best part this screen there nothing set up once it opened ! you just pull 2 straps quickly it ready use ! it comes some stakes , but i've never used them . i suppose they might helpful strong winds . case handles work well over shoulder carrying . overall , very good value	1
i started using bodyrev because i wanted stronger , less flabby arms . i able work out my legs abs ok without any sort gadget , but i join gym get arm workout worth anything . i doing 30 pushups 3x week ok but too much strain one dimensional - i wanted something intermediate nothing full or knee pushups gym pullups . ( i am contemplating buying perfect pushup . ) bodyrev delivers , exceeded my expectations . after 2 weeks essentials and/or bootcamp 3x/week , my arms looked noticably better . after 2 months they really , really solid , but trimmer more toned . ( i'm grrl , that good . ) seriously , i weight assisted pullups year gym my arms didn't look this good . bodyrev fits under couch , although it usually it so i rev while watching tv . bootcamp workout good cardio workout targets arms core . production quality little rough sometimes " 2 more " turns " 4 more " but overall workout good one you get pretend you're kicking doors while navy seal alden mills smiles tells you reward yourself more pushups . moves designed use " functional training " so it easy imagine when use muscles worked out would come into play real life , even if you're not boxer or navy seal . i can't yet bootcamp all 3 weights , but i most " essentials " 15 min workouts ( better beginners than bootcamp ) all weights . also , bodyrev customer service excellent . highly recommend bodyrev .	1

i looked into buying gazelle because i heard it little/low impact knees i knee problem limited my excersise routine recently ... when i received my gazelle , it fairly easy put together . it took hour . directions easy follow only extra tool required ( not included ) screwdriver . i anxious try it out . so , i streached out bit got right . since then , i used my gazelle least 5 days/week i enjoy doing it . it good work out i watch tv while doing it . it perfect now summer comming here arizona it hard go outside walk or run heat . i rated this item 4 stars ( instead five ) two reasons . one because your feet actually get sore ( bottoms them bumps non-stick pad)- unless you wear tennis shoes . other reason because it little noisy . other than , i like it alot	1
if you parent can't get gym , i would suggest you get gazelle . i got mine only $25 what bargin . i really love this machine . i usually watch tv or listen music while working out . when i am gazelle time goes sooo fast . before you know it , it time me head work . however , like many reviewers my gazelle make noise ( that why i gave it four stars ) . i brought wd40 squeaking stop . hope this helpful	1
i would say average best . but low cost so what would you expect . worth what i paid	1

i purchased door gym based reviews . it fabulous device works advertised . stable , multiple workout options neutral grip , chin-up pull-up positions , after two weeks use , i see difference feel it . broad reach bar just came , after testing it , i agree it shouldn't used kids , unless they've shown how use it ; broad reach bar could slip off if child , jump up reach it . update : this thing genius . before , i would strain two pull ups . now i 15 . i don't lift weights anymore , i use big flexible bands , door gym pushups . i've never felt stronger .	1

if you own shottie this best mag you buy . it holds 170 rounds compared stock mag which only holds maybe 17 . fits crosman s32p many other shotties . slam !!!!	1
i love these things ! they're very comfortable so much more convenient easier store than mat . best if you practice carpet home . super travel . i wish i'd known these when i started yoga ; i'd gotten them before i got mat . cons - ( 1 ) not great full body floor asanas . ( 2 ) foot " paws " slip little , but i've seen something similar back elastics hold them place , i don't like look them .	1
love knife , it just little too large carry my pocket regular basis . i returned it bought chive .. it perfect	1
maintains decent edge , opening/lock/closing mechanism simple smooth . color intense seen pic , pretty resistant wear . general , happy knife	1
leek wonderful knife , but its sword-like point subject breakage . ( throwing knife into wooden target invariably break tip -- which what happened two my leeks ! ) fortunately , kershaw lives up its lifetime guarantee policy quickly replaced both my broken knives brand-new ones , no questions asked . i just shipped them knife , explaining what happened , week later got back new knife . knife itself opens beautifully , though i've found liner lock sometimes sticks isn't easy depress one hand .	1
when buggie arrived , it didn't work . i call razor customer service dept . their service awful . senior agent very rude . i managed figure out problem my own . electrical unit not connected . once it connected , it worked fine . we two them . kids love them . they lightweight ride well carpet . overall , product good .	1
this purchsed december ' 06 given my boyfriend our 17 month old daughter , he loved it ! he put it his truck right away ! great product	1
great product . amazon packing shipping reeks overkill . box twice long deep enough pack four mats . more economical packaging	1
bike easy assemble . works great , cant beat shipping cost	1
feels extremely fragile rightly so , since it broke first time i test fired it . fortunately , i got it free purchase . i wouldn't recommend this gun even beginners	-1
i this bike over 3 months ride it 5 6 days week 20 25 minutes each day . it great bike ! it easy assemble ( though i my husband doing most it ) takes up very little space . i keep it close tv so i ride it while watching my favorite shows . it very quiet . it more features than what i use - i just want know how long i'm riding , how fast , how far . but i'm sure extra features may appeal others . i highly recommend this bike . it very reasonably priced well worth money .	1
i received this bike birthday gift am please overall it . one irritant i found some hardware already installed bike , so i spent 10 minutes looking screws , nuts , washers already bike . just aware when you purchase this , even though there separate package hardware comes bike , majority hardware already installed so don't assume you got shorted some pieces . tension little difficult set up i plan looking more into it . i what instructions told me , however there doesn't seem " easy " setting so far this bike . tension setting range 1 - 8 , 1 easiest , but i don't notice any differences ranges . i know other person reviewed this bike didn't like it cycled through information while riding , but i actually prefer it . i found it nice able just look screen know how many miles i ridden , what my speed , etc .. without interrupt my workout push any buttons .	1
i installed v2000 only compass , my vehicle already equipped temperature sensor . i appreciate easy-to-read dual display compass rose degrees . v2000 seems very accurate it displayed same degrees my army-issue lensatic compass . it easily installed aligned very helpful night overcast sky , when no stars visible . i would definitely recommend this product	1

i really like this storage rack . cost versus function quite high . it now provides place our 4 bicycles plus associated gear ... no more scrambling around locating all necessary equipment ride either trail or road ! it doesn't room every piece sports gear we own , course , but seasonal adjustments puts everything we need within reach	1
i used my mc-2g year am very impressed , i not think any improvements i would make . adjust magnetic declination , compass flipped upside down access adjustment screw direct reading declination scale . fine green index line little difficult see until i started adjustment line moved away red declination marks . now i know what it looks like - it easy spot . two scales read directly miles , one scale maps using 1:24000 ( 1 inch = 24000 map inches ) one scale maps using 1:62500 ( 1 inch = 62500 map inches ) . i believe scales not go corners compass because corners rounded , plus three scales would then overlap . this my favorite compass	1
compass handles very nicely . housing more comfortable turn than silva ranger cl . this started become significant after few minutes handling . suunto used one hand whereas it difficult me operate silva due small knurls housing . bottom part mirror half-moon hole it allowing midpoint view your map . very nice . global gimbal system needle pretty handy you don't hold compass totally flat it operate correctly . or i could learn hold base level , too . presumably southern hemisphere magnetic field causes compass needle roll bi t.t he one very strange thing this model declination markers inside housing printed upside down . it appears suunto went declination readable opposing side while making declination adjustment since compass must turned upside down this . it interesting way differentiate . inclinometer probably pretty handy snow travel among other things . base little wide my hand , silva . mirror appears replaceable . good thing since it glass . map markings don't start edge compass . i prefer this since i never feel comfortable , but it personal preference . it 1:24000 1:62500 (?) scale map measurements . sighting notch seems work well . lid snaps base tightly due thickness lid , you can't quite twist your thumb pop it . it practice problem , i'm guessing . key lanyard adjusting declination , though i don't think i'd it because i'd forget realign i t.t he compass very heavy compared baseplate design but that due lid . it consideration if you're ultralighter . those ounces really add up . there lighter mirror compasses available . base not centimeter scale whereas silva	1

pennants great memento winning season my favorite baseball team . they great condition displayed years come . awesome product great price	1
i picked up 1 these well 3 single gun versions when they $24 each , just before xmas 2005 . they built nicely metal hinges latches . description says aluminum but sides seem sturdy silver plastic , not painted platic thankfully . frame aluminum though . well worth what i paid . i wish i bought range case before price went up . it $42 before . only problem smaller guns , padding doesn't hold psitol tight enough so it moves during transport . nothing thin layer extra padding or magazine added under thicker padding won't fix . locks nice extra but won't hold back older child or adult determined get pistol .	1
we purchased this swim belt after introduced it during our four year olds swim lessens . not only it great aid then but even more so when using it our own . we would highly recomend this anyone whos child difficulty staying afloat when vertical , but wants there own when swimming .	1
i love my watch . function count calories burned during your workout very helpful . i take lot classes like step turbo kickbox so its great able idea what i'm actually burning . it easy take your heart rate if it doesn't take first time , you just lick your fingers then it reads fine . i haven't problem taking my heart rate while cycling or jumping around . watch little bulky so i'm glad i got petite . it definitely sporty so i wouldn't wear it dinner or anything , but it looks fine gym ! i'm really glad i got it so i track my calories burned better	1
i enjoyed using heart rate monitor , but sometimes difficult time getting it reset . probably just because when i am my excercise , i am warm tired . sometimes it take me several minutes get it cleared . but it serves it purpose heart rate monitor i bought it , so i like way . band not most comfortable , but assume just part necessary design .	1
great buy , my three son who this his 7yr old brother five ans 20 month old sisters love it . it use well ans shows no signs distress . easy put together . here time christmas . looking " lighting mcqueen " one now purchase [ ...	1
i moments away purchasing this but decided call local knife ship any details found out clock wasnt waterproof . so seeing i am my school cadets experiencing rain , lake mud i really needed sturdy tool i wouldnt afraid get wet . but thorough research this probably best tool your average user who doesnt want classic red handles . so good size , colour , design , tools but not waterproof .	1
one best tihings i've ever purchased ! i love top ability keep track miles i run calories i burn . because i always suspected stats treadmill off . just wish it came more colors . i'm not really girlie girl so wearing pink watch everyday would bit much	1
i recently bought several blow-up plastic snow sleds try . this one favorite whole family . while all other sleds go wherever they want , this sled steering wheel indeed goes wherever you want . it also seems very durble - i am 180 lbs rode it together my 7 year old daughter , even jumping over snow bumps	1
i got this mail yesterday . it arrived long box filled packing peanuts . after digging around foam clumps i retrieved black white spoted box which held this sword . after examining it i found out few things . i got blade worth cost paid it . detail dragon carving sheath nice . i see some glue around top pommel where blade connects grip . however it not distracting or noticable unless you look closely . its balance okay , but it no toy it edge . enough force you injure someone , especially if you stab them . this something used practicing swings well just admiring . blade covered oil when delevered . you wipe it off , or leave it if you not intend use it . oil preserve condition blade which plus when it not used . overall this great purchase . however i not think this sword could survive combat without chipped . not sure quality steel used creating it . so its great blade admire own if you no intentions practicing actual swordplay it	1
wayfinder very nicely packaged built , rugged accurate compass . it provides 5 degree sensitivity numeric display , versus typical 45 degree compass points most automotive application units . result , some environments , e.g. areas lots metal surroundings , you may notice numeric readout change back or forth you would not see typical 45 degree type compass . it should noted interference environments affect all compasses , but when this one significantly affected , it tell you displaying distortion , so you know currently displayed accuracy suspect . areas i tried it , wayfinder accurate my lensmatic engineering compass , but lot easier use . it comes equipped dual suction cup mount which stays put my motorcycle windshield while driving down washboard dirt roads high speed . post this topic indicated compass would not stay put . chalk up operator ignorance . suction cups must wet stick glass , but manual not mention this , likely assuming people common sense , when obviously they don't . all suction cups require moisture cups stick glass . only bad thing this unit it discontinued , replaced unit more features lot more expense . bottom line , if you need high quality , off-road tough , accurate compass , find wayfinder before they all gone !	1
i bought this myself play ( i'm 35 ) after all presents opened toys , video games , everything forgotten ( 4 hours after christmas ) , this ongoing favorite season . everybody , younger ( down 8 ) older ( 45 ) blast this thing after couple minutes coaching . it already everybodys wish lists upcoming birthdays such . this great present 11-18 boy . fair warning though , there some good spills fairly short , steep learning curve - helmets , knee pads , blah , blah , must ( video camera !	1
i don't know what other people talking , but this gun spring gun not shoot automatic . also , there no batteries come it , except laser batteries even if they don't work , it not end world . gun shoots suggested speed . 12 grams but i would recommend using . 2 grams . this gun so accurate . 2 grams shoot nearly same distance . people who said this gun piece crap easily broken retarded . it made plastic break if you treat it like metal gun . i hade mine several months it works like charm	1

this nice piece equipment price . i looking under $300 collapsable workout center . exactly what i got . it works what i wanted it allows me great workout . only con i see bands don't give enough resistance . starter gym it great , but if someone moving gym home workout it might not enough resistance . purchase replacement bands you go through stamina , but each band around $10 or less so isn't too bad . i also modify some workouts described book make them more efficient	1
product works advertised . used it snorkeling maui water temps around 70-75 degrees no fogging up . only drawback applying small amount since it gel form ... trick squeeze out bit your finger then rub inside mask . not take much	1

if you like me , found taste consistency products like gu clif shots pretty nasty , you'll very happy switch these shot bloks , which remind me eating gummy bears . you get energy boost electrolytes you need while participating strenuous sports such climbing , running , biking , etc . without mess inconvenience those gooey energy products . i've tried most flavors , found all ones i tried tasty enjoyable eat . i like able eat just few bloks time package , contrast needing consume entire package gu or clif shots once ( or suffer sticky consequences ) . shot bloks seem give me same kick-start those older products , i actually like eating them . give them try -- i think you'll pleased them	1
received this item yesterday mail . delivery quick considering i used free shipping option ( week half get ) . piece cake assemble , instructions clear easy follow bolts nuts packaged into 8 or so little baggies one each step instruction set ( this way you don't really figure out which bolt they referring ) . i assembled it myself , didn't need more then one person which nice . hardest part assembling it myself first step , which attach front stabilizer bar wheels it . this requires you lift front end slightly keep it elevated while you screw this piece . once you it though it easy move point because wheels . gave it try it runs smooth quiet me even high resistance i still watch tv without turning volume crazy amount . so far overall i've found it great use even though i've only using it day ;) only problem i back right stabilizer bar got dinged because plastic cap end cracked . it decorative thing but my only problem . i watched them unload carry it into my apartment ( eagle freight ) they not gentle all so only thing broken makes me happy .	1

i find this unit excellent choice money . it adjustable speed 1.0 mph 10 mph . 1 increments . belt ample width long enough longer strides . display easy read controls well marked . it readouts speed , fat burned , calories burned , speed belt distance travelled time session . also there pulse monitor . it safety key necessary operate unit which clips you emergency shut-off . if you want pause session you push stop button all read-outs frozen . if you pull safety key unit stops readout goes blank . belt platform folds up fo storage case it necessary . my only complaint i wish pulse monitor operated little faster . assembly instructions could use improvement description screws could better . although instructions recomend helper some steps i able assemble it alone . it appears solid unit i expect get much use out it	1

you need two allen ( hexagonal head ) wrenches install this kickstand . what i don't like : there no instructions included . even greenfield industries website no instructions . while i suppose there only one way it all fit together , few diagrams would nice . also it would helped know attachment point should moved far rear possible . until i this , my heel struck stand when pedaling . i presume this function both my shoe size ( size 11 , male ) length position horizontal frame member which stand attaches . my bike , i think rider size 13 or larger show might well problem . again , greenfield industries website should provide this information , but this writing it not . inner mounting bracket mysterious hole top , there no matching hole outer bracket . there no lockwashers provided , though perhaps they unnecessary . what i like : it light , strong , reasonably priced , easy install , appears well made . rear mounting avoids conflicts pedals crank arms . it looks great , though it makes bike look rather like police bike -- perhaps not bad thing if one worried theft .	1

cute boy bike --- we pleased style , color , fit .... however , columbia only provided general manual safety , fit , technical information adult bikes they sell . nothing specific how put this bike together . most it assembled when it arrived --- hardware allotted holes , we assemble handle bars , training wheels , etc . now we just fine tuning tightening handle bars special hex tools , tweaking breaks , adjusting fenders so they centered ... if we instruction manual specific bike , we would able make sure everything assembled correctly . when i contacted columbia customer service , only thing they recommended we take bike bike store professional assemble . i asked if they authorized dealer my area they recommend ( especially if something fail under warranty down road ... ) cs rep. said " no , any bike shop could it . " i asked if they send out manuals dealers , if so , maybe i receive copy . response " dealers put together bikes all time any them should able it " . if i bought $500 mountain bike , yes i would probably want dealer assemble . however , my opinion 12 inch children bike should able assembled competent parents who good set instructions . if it recommended professional dealer put it together , it should noted description bold letters so i know what expect before i buy .	1
i am really happy it price . it bit tricky get adjusted , but not hard figure out they say . long you know those two straps bottom belt . it seems well built , although i havnt chance test it out extreme conditions yet . one thing keep mind it might not best smaller body types . i am quite thin it took quite bit get it fit me . i still dont think it fits way it should but least its comfortable . ill probably end up modding it get it fit better . smaller people might better off thigh holster	1
i admit , it little tricky figure out first , but if my 55 year old mother figure it out , then i'm sure someone who police force 30 years should able , also . anyone thinking buying this , long velcro straps hanging down your belt . after you figure out , you should no problems . i wish it would fit little more snug , but maybe i some more adjusting . over all , it comes real handy	1
i bought this rower 6 months ago after comparing different ones . decided splurge this i thought it would give realistic feeling durable . overall , i like rower - it built solid smooth operation . it takes 1-2 hours put together . unfortunately , we missing small , but important part - call customer service - called friday got part monday . meantime , i so impatient i went lowes found part would work so i could start using it immediately . only cons it straps feet - they tend come loose after little while - could probably easily fixed something else . only other con placement feet . i wish i could adjust them little bit terms position . otherwise , i've enjoyed rower think it last many years	1
kettler kedett rowing machine amazing piece equipment . i unpacked mine last night despite missing washer wade through 90 minutes assembly instructions , i impressed very start . solidity perfect fit parts , it clear this machine product german engineering . i haven't seen anything so well designed years . each part fits well , tightens nicely still rotates or slides ease . machine sturdy , sits well carpet or hard flooring easily folds into compact shape when not use . workout kadett better than any workout i've ever experienced , aside rowing or kayaking . motion very realistic , nothing distract one beyond small chirping pistons occasional knock seat against front rail . it easy close my eyes imagine myself rowing down quiet river . entire experience more like meditation than exercise -- perfect way start , or end , busy day . after 45 minute workout , i wasn't sure i really gotten particularly strenuous workout . then i stepped off machine realized my legs like rubber . it subtle . i highly recommend this machine anyone looking alternative ordinary . full-body workout provided rowing beautiful thing . price less than most elliptical trainers , unit weighs only 66lbs , it gives your arms workout too ! i can't say enough good things this machine . happy rowing	1
i bought this keep my bike(s ) my possession when going mall , bars , stores , etc . there isn't much say other then u lock very hardy heavy cable good thickness well . it also nice u lock comes multiple keys , cable comes velcro strap help manage it when riding . visible combination u lock cable alone probably best deterrent , although if put test it looks like they would hold up well . almost all surfaces both parts rubberized so they'll resist scratching your bike paint . clasp hang u lock seems somewhat iffy , but i haven't problems yet . overall if you want strong u lock cable keep your front wheel or seat , this great combo pretty fair ( comparatively ) price	1

simple , yet very effective heart rate monitor ! i got it over month replacing dbase hr monitor gym . i ride bike quite bit so i got polar s720 initially . i thought it way too much simple hr monitoring . if it wasn't relatively high price ( got my $69 , when other brands offer $40 or less ) , s120 would get my five-star .	1
after trying many heart rate monitors , i decided s120 provided best array features my needs . i also considered strongly s150 , however , i don't much information available instantly ( speed , distance , time , heart rate , etc . ) i s120 my cateye cyclocomputer . s120 lets me target my heart zone helps keep it within my training range day . also , when i am my exercise set , i get report date , length exercise , average heart rate maximum heart rate . unfortunately , s120 discontinued . i haven't found any current lineup come close providing features i find most useful . one warning i'd like share when batteries need replacement , send them factory service center , i think there three us . i bought one ebay used after swim , i noticed crystal fogged up . i sent unit polar service pc board unit destroyed because battery replaced incorrectly . yes , polar battery replacement pricey , but it certainly less expensive than replacing whole unit , i now . yes , i am going buy s120 , my third one all .	1
super easy set up take down . compact appears durable . good cloth " pillowtop " which like thin mattress pad . i would recommend this product	1
although i am overall satisfied knife , appearance somewhat disproportionate feeling . what i mean first glance , main locking blade seems little dainty , slim , frail ; but upon further inspection you see blade plentiful thick metal " feels " strong hardened well . i attribute this simple design oversight pairs new curvy body old straight blade design . some curve design main blade , which new one-handed opening eyelet designed knives victorinox implement , would make overall feel more satisfying eye . overall construction well designed feel expected victorinox but i am not sure locking bottle opener totally necessary , even if large flat screwdriver head tool . blade razor sharp right out box feels good hold your hand . sheath would nice addition , even if it meant add couple bucks price , but might just aftermarket purchase those requiring one . price , this knife great buy !	1
i only one issue trainer , my tire slips/spins faster than trainer times i increase my pedaling effort . i need make few more attempts adjusting pressure this might my fault . otherwise it great . came assembled , very easy setup adjust . adjustable resistance great . combined 14 speed you get huge range resistance very easy quite difficult . this my first trainer so i don't any baseline compare it , but i would recomend this anyone , especially novice/intermediate bikers who long , snowy winters deal like we here michigan . great product	1
if you find yourself use your kubotan , chances , it critical situation . traditionally , kubotans made out durable hardwood . however , i chose get one made out hardened aluminum added reliability . hardened aluminum not break event you use it put pressure someone wrist . i think it safe say person wrist bones would break before this little metal rod . friend mine , who studied martial arts , used carry wooden baton like this one . if he still carried them today , i am convinced he would choose aluminum one though . my friend tip : here tip old friend mine . keys themselves part weapon . you make them more effective , which increase damage baton . take some keys you no longer use . any metal key would , but try find different sizes . four them would . take keys grinder sharpen teeth each key . now , put four keys keyring your regular keys . face sharp keys opposite directions . meaning two should face one way , but other two should face opposite direction . idea when you swing baton like flail , sharpened keys would cut into attacker flesh . keys faced opposite directions so you major damage regardless which direction you swinging . citan experiment : please keep mind you also cut your hand . i tried this technique . i wore pair leather work gloves swung against wooden post . sharpened keys bounced back hit back my hand . without gloves , my hand would gotten badly cut . what it worth , i swung against large watermelon keys didn't bounce back though . i don't anything else add here , except maybe it might good swing against attacker fleshy parts prevent keys rebounding . i'm not expert though . but it fun trying it watermelon .	1
product great . small , bright , easy hold , tad heavy but not enough issue . i recommend it . good " defensive " product also	1

i got this ball because i want lose weight get better shape . i also think it fun bounce ! this bell body ball comes foot pump video led mindy mylrea . i like video lot using it body ball regularly , but pump needs work . ours broke before we finished pumping up ball , so we hard time getting it completely inflated -- i think one valves came loose . other than , though , i've really enjoyed using this product . bouncing ball makes me feel like kid again when i work out seriously ball , i definitely feel progress . this cost effective way get back shape .	1

i've used jansport bags since elementary school continue use them this day . i ended up using this particular bag not books but rather alternative traditional carry-on piece luggage . its also comes handy occasional overnight stay hotel where normal piece luggage wouldn't practical . my only compplaint amazon method ordering not very user friendly when it came picking color . i selected black w/ balck suede but eneded up recieving color i not choose ( black w/ brown suede ) . it still looked fine i kept it rather than go through hassle returning it correct color	1
i bought similar backback almost 3 years ago . ( jansport leather bottom ... it only one backpocket though)it lasted me up until last month ... back pocket started tear near zipper point . i wanted replace it " normal " jansport backpack ( without leather bottom ) but when i went retail stores check them out , they didn't feel like quality one i before . i'm so glad i bought this one replace my backpack . it such sturdy backpack . it even better than my previous backpack because it extra pocket back pockets larger . texture backpack also feels stronger . price amazon also very good ( i saved great amount over buying mall ) . perfect college student ... even full load books	1
i'm up down this thing , but it still best one out there . it charges via docking station plugs into outlet . that 90-minute charge one hour viewing . mini docking station also battery-fed connected watch make much longer viewing experience . it fits just like normal watch takes up just much space . headphones double uhf/vhf antennae , so if you hate those two little buttons keep falling out your ears much i , you're kind out luck trying use your ultra-cool stereo headsets . until i figure out what next , i just fit buttons inside headset cups it works fine . reception headpieces keep elusive fifth star making it appearance here . if you think you're going watch your favorite shows basement or train , forget it . otherwise all local channels show up sweetly crisply only most minor intermittent fluctuations	1

i found this good table my personal needs fabulous price . i shopped all over web this definitely best deal . it lightweight because it little short skinny . i prefer it short skinny so i store it easily small room . check measurements make sure it long enough what you want . i like extra-extra smooshy padding , so i added cheap foam pad walmart over table put twin size sheet over , but you wouldn't if you like regular massage table feel . i don't use it portable table , so i'm not sure how convenient it would take down up . it probably better personal massage table , not " professional " table . i larger table my office where i work . hope this helps	1
i've this stroller couple weeks , so far i'm pleased it . my older kid 3 younger one 3 months . both seem like it . i've single-seat bob " sport utility " stroller two years , here some comparisons might useful : instep much cheaper ( i got it $80 ; paid ~ $200 single bob ) . i think it better value money , though bob clearly better built probably more durable ( more below ) . instep much heavier , even taking into account single-vs-double frame . bob aluminum frame while instep uses steel . i'll need careful not leave it out rain , i bob . instep inferior construction bob : - fabric thinner , appears less durable- quick-release front wheel lower quality ; consequently , it takes more work adjust wheel keep stroller going straight ; bob more like what you'd find quality bicycle , fewer centering issues . other hand , i prefer instep quick-release mechanisms rear wheels bob . - handbrake doesn't work well bob ; perhaps due instep greater weight , perhaps not . handle plastic , though quite solid . it easy use either hand , though it oriented left one . - canopy doesn't curve downward it bob . result , kids tend get some afternoon sun their eyes even canopy place . i've " fixed " this safety-pinning some fabric down edge canopy . instep parking brakes separate hand-brake engage using cogs attached rear wheels , whereas bob parking brake just locks handbrake . this advantage 1 ) more secure 2 ) not loosening handbrake cable over time . disadvantage it takes slightly more effort engage than bob handbrake lock . noted other reviews , instep seats very reclined , even their steepest settings ; however , my kids don't seem mind this all . fact , sleeping , instep may more comfortable . seats themselves smaller than bob , but that expected duallie this size . speaking size , instep obviously much wider than single-seat bob . it won't fit through narrow ( 30 '' ) doorways , but that exactly what i expected based published dimensions , which similar other dual strollers ' . it fits just fine trunk my car ( vw golf ) when i remove wheels . one advantage increased width more stable stance sloped terrain . some steeper driveway aprons , i find narrower bob near its tipping point ; not so instep . ground clearance instep much lower than bob . when i descend tall curbs , bottom often scrapes bit . but since bottom free lift up ( unless you're habit carrying heavy stuff underneath ) , there no real damage . instep shock absorbers ( nice ! ) , but they're much stiffer than bob . perhaps they'd perfect two heavier kids , but my kids ( combined weight = 40 lb ) , it seems tad too stiff . little pouch attached handlebar nice addition instep , missing bob . noted other reviewers , straps instep take more work secure remove . bob clearly superior this regard , though i don't see it huge factor given i strap kids , run hour , then unstrap them . bob three 16 '' wheels , whereas instep smaller front wheel . i bit concerned this when i bought it , but after going running it several times ( pavement ) , i see no problems smaller front wheel . if anything , it makes stroller slightly easier pack into my trunk . off-roading , smaller wheel low ground clearance might problem , but that not concern me right now . overall , instep terrific value i would highly recommend it right price	1

before i bought this watch , i lot research offerings suunto , polar nike , finally ended up choosing lance 4 watch my cycling-specific activities . i say , my disappointment began within 2 minutes opening shipping box . here three major ways this watch ( nike itself ) failed me : 1 ) this complicated , multi-function instrument . but if you're expecting detailed instruction manual , forget it . what you get elaborate pictograph illustrates which buttons push . it skims over setup procedure many most important functions , omits many features entirely . 2 ) relative above complaint , i contacted nike customer service setup . since i'm cyclist , i particularly interested altimeter function , dismayed how thin " manual " . instructions say you select 60- , 10- or 2-second sampling rate barometric pressure order determine altitude . what it fails mention what ramifications choosing one over other ? one more accurate ? one use more battery power ? we'll apparently never know , because nike customer service failed answer question . while they admitted they received several complaints manual -- considering writing new one -- they simply sidestepped my question altimeter function their email reply . 3 ) then there performance watch itself . most cases it impressive -- , every case except one which i purchased it : altimeter . my group rides , there always least three other people altimeters . post-ride comparison altimeter results always puts their readings within 3 percent each other . results nike least 20 percent off . means altimeter results not trusted . while watch attractive ( that why it earned 2 stars instead just one ) excellent band , it simply doesn't give me accurate altimeter results i need . since altimeter results so far off , i only assume its built-in weather sensor ( also based barometric pressure ) hugely flawed , too . manual light information it , nike customer service either unwilling or unable shed any light watch usage flawed performance altimeter function , i only say this watch represents major disappointment . it may meet nike standards fashion , but it fails my standards performance	1

it best price around when it finally showed up my door i couldn't wait put it together until it harder than it looked . you should use more than one person put it together maybe it my fault but net not fast nor easy set up , just like box says it challenge . extremely ! i would not recommend this product someone who no time nor patience hour long set up process . i recommend anything folds up quick pops up into position . but extreme deal would actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online less than 500$ . you might spend money but not deal headaches over over again putting this together well worth it . find your self area out side build your real cage enjoy it all year long . nets not worth time nor money , balls still fly up out net , you really close fabric just like tent . much force im hitting balls it wont long till material damaged . dont waste your money even if you get it 60 bucks . wind always win , once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass . get bigger better deals real cage	1

i bought this watch one design sailboat racing , it many thoughful improvements over other watches/countdown timers . it countdown timer sync button reminder beeps , tack/gybe angle calculator benzel like " one-wheel " musto compucourse or citizen sailhawk or navisail . it fits nice niche below expensive full function regatta watches like citizen sailhawk suunto regatta would shame beat up while racing , more features than inexpensive timex ironman or optimum time series race watches . pros : -countdown timer beeps minute every 59 seconds , every ten seconds last minute , every second last ten seconds . -count up or repeat option after countdown complete . repeat doesn't stop after seven times unlike casio watches . -long hold required stop countdown timer . electronic lock sync button manually activated . -countdown particular time so race committee start gun exact minute ( like 11am promptly ) . -tactical benzel click stops every five degrees so less likely drift lose track wind direction during race . -reasonable large numbers countdown timer-nice euro look isn't fugly imho unlike old musto competition watch or ronstan clear start watch so it worn outside race course . -left out silly sensors such electronic compass , barometer , altimeter useless day racing makes watch more afforable than suunto sailing watches these functions . -one design class legal because it doesn't built gps . still love my foretrex 201 races which allow them , but this looks like good pre-start timer strict od class regattas don't allow gps . cons : -benzel only click stops but no lock so drift during normal sailboat operations . -no 5-degree markers benzel interpolating 15 degree labels result errors . also no 70 degree or 80 degree tack angle marks watch inside benzel . why doesn't someone come out cheap digital tack angle computer watch help us joes poor memory remember tack angles ? calculation tack angles easy . its hard recalculating tack angles detect headers/lifts because you forgot numbers while steering boat puffy , choppy conditions while simultaneously looking air , looking mark , jostling dozen other boats going upwind . -non-intuitive buttons menus strange short or long press certain buttons different functions requires time spent instruction manual scratching one head . -not all functions documented instructions such logbook . -silly designers mixed up starboard port tack angle arrow colors . arrow pointing 45 degrees left north would port direction , but starboard tack should green . gybe angle colors correct .	1

this great mat ! after two months , 40 yoga-hours , least 1,000 sun salutations , mat shows zero wear . out box , it slippery . however , once release compound worn off or washed off , mat great grip even when wet . my opinion , this mat makes practice old , imperfect hard wood floor studio much more comfortable . if someone wear out this mat , then they probably doing way too much yoga !	1

this heavy bag stand pretty good piece equipment . heavy bag part it definitely requires add'l weight ( hint : bags sand much cheaper than amount barbell plates you'll need keep this thing moving - i use 200 pounds bags sand keep it place . also sure you get double end heavy bag too ( i.e. one bottom d-ring ) , otherwise you'll get too much bag swing . you also put true double end light bag this portion unit , which nice change pace heavy bag . ( light double end bag small inflatable two bungees holding it chest level reverberates like mad when you hit it . ) speed bag platform bit flimsy , especially earlier models where " drum " or rebound board two pieces ( latest versions this model use single piece drum ) . if you become moderately proficient speed bag any amount time you'll outgrow this aspect unit . part problem single vertical pole which speedbag drum attaches flex when you get bag moving really fast , throw off your timing . use smallest size speed bag possible minimize this inertia . lastly , speed bag platform doesn't really adjust high enough people over 6'2 " height , if you're over 6'1 " or so you're going need use small or xtra small speed bag it hang correct height ( i.e. belly bag mouth/chin level )	1

any sword only $15 fact very dangerous . these swords called wallhangers because they only designed hung wall , not swung . reason underneath handle very small piece metal connects blade itself . ( called tang ) real martial arts sword , tang normally thick piece metal almost thickness sword itself . if you swing wallhanger too often or too hard it break tang , fly off hurt someone . if you want learn more how dangerous these wallhangers google search words : anatomy wallhangerany sword designed real martial arts practice- like iaido , starts $250 not $15 , should bought reputable iaido store . ( sorry i am not allowed recommend web sites here ) . so smart , either hang this sword back wall , or throw it out before your baby brother/sister hurts someone	-1

past couple decades , only real name pocket flashlights maglite minimag . used police professionals alike , even honored design awards , minimag pretty much ran show since it introduction 1984 . sure , light output just decent , " beam focus " feature gimmick no one really used , but well-engineered flashlight , it couldn't beat . until now . it classic david vs goliath tale - fenix p1d-ce small even small flashlight scale , keyring small , silly small ; picture cylinder roughly half height aluminum soda diameter nickel : that kind small we're talking here . it doesn't even look real ; size combined perfectly smooth exquisitely faceted exterior gives impression this perhaps 1/2 scale mock up actual flashligh t.t he disbelief continues you remove fenix it slightly-larger-than-a-cigarette-pack box . p1d-ce without battery weighs 27 grams , or weight 27 paper clips . more precisely , that less mass than ipod nano . that * less than one ounce * . but feel without question cold unyielding touch heavy-gauge type iii aluminum , lens not just actual glass , but perfectly flat coated optics-grade glass . size might not serious , but engineering certainly . yet all dimensional absurdity just prelude light itself - this where real ridiculousness begins : light phosphor-white ( similar hid car headlight color ) , but plainly speaking , there more it than physically possible object this size . it would make more sense if someone standing behind you spotlight , or perhaps if fenix nuclear-powered . p1d-ce produces * more than twice total light output 4 cell full-size maglite * . point fenix ceiling unlit room area lit more ambient light than 15 watt light bulb . license plates street signs hundreds feet away blaze life night . shine it your eyes you're legally blind next twenty seconds . course , unless you turn it down ... if fenix engineers weren't content alien-technology light source , p1d-ce also includes " modes " which give you range lighting options . you probably don't always want walk around flashlight blazing full-tilt , so there low , medium , high settings . twisting head flashlight turns it , twisting it off again moves it into next mode . there also " strobe " mode , which flicks light off quickly stroboscopic effect , sos , allowing you send emergency signal automatically without further touching flashlight all . all this powered - ( drum roll ) - one battery . no fumbling giant family packs box store batteries just get some light , single 123a lithium battery ( sold overpriced your local store " photo batteries " section , find them online less than $2 each ) powers everything . battery life varies wildly modes - low mode net you over 10 hours , while high suck cell dry less than hour . but key here " intelligent " circuitry ; unlike flashlights old , where you could determine battery life how bright light , fenix employs power regulator circuit - no more slowly fading light over time , leaving you wonder if flashlight really bright it could ; p1d-ce just bright when batteries first installed nearly all total runtime . means low setting , ninth hour beyond just bright first few minutes . since it lithium battery , months shelf time doesn't make difference . so what fenix secret ? it all comes down led technology , durham , north carolina-made cree led p1d-ce fine example . just you buy led light bulb your house which uses less than tenth energy incandescent bulb , same concept works just well flashlights , people starting notice - these super-small , super-efficient led flashlights all rage nowadays ; police departments actually doing away old full-size maglite replacing them newer better mini led lights , which p1d-ce large margin brightest most versatile . you're only $70 away dumping your vintage incandescent antique joining them . five tiny but beaming stars fenix remarkable introduction 21st century lighting technology . ( addendum : what new led minimag ? maglite new led series minimags less than half light output fenix , their " energy management " circuit doesn't quite live up it name , so light gradually dims over time like most other flashlights . led minimags also larger heavier than incandescent originals , still use plastic lens prone scuffing , still use type ii aluminum collects nicks scratches over time . powered regular aa cells [ no brightness options ] , battery life most four hours until completely dead , plus there no polarity protection ; should you accidentally place batteries backwards , light destroyed . led minimag definite improvement over original , but not quite par fenix .	1

i've got relatively small knife collection ( maybe 15 blades ) , but this one i tend carry every day . i've got few kershaws , speed-safe opening what initially attracted me brand . said , while it cool way open knife , i've ultimately decided it mostly gimmick . i find it just fast , somewhat easier , open knife thumb stud . my collection 3 other kershaws : two chives avalanche . leek best size carry/defensive knife . blade long without cumbersome , shape sleek manageable . knife also good chores , although anything really heavy , i'd use bigger blade like avalanche or blur . black finish nice -- although truthfully , my leek titanium oxide ( rainbow ) . one my chives black , though , finish sleek holds up well . this knife definitely worth price	1

i carry least one swiss army knife me every where i go ( except plane , course ) . this 3 1/2 inch all-purpose tool suitable your pocket , glove compartment or tool box . this knife dozens uses do-it-yourselfer , gardener or camper . this little wonder large small knife , corkscrew , punch , opener flat blade screwdrive end , bottle opener flat blade screwdriver end what purports wire stripper side ( i never used ) , key ring , tweezers toothpick . this knife water resistant made high quality components . i tend use knives pocket knife more than any other tools . after i find combination one knives tweezers useful splinters thorns , thus tweezers often become third most useful tool . i must admit occasionally i use toothpick , particularly when real toothpicks not available . smaller screwdriver blade small enough it also fit into phillips head screw . i even able use flat blade some small internal hex head screws . i never used corkscrew , i used punch awl . opener blade yet used this knife well . difficulty carrying tools they fill your pocket very quickly . this small swiss army knife small enough fit into purse or pocket yet large enough useful . while larger swiss army knives even more larger tools blades , they also harder carry . course this particular knife not replace tool box , but i find it amazing how many tasks i accomplish simple tools available this gem .	1
used this pedometer several weeks i found it not always record your activity . like previous reviewer , i noticed my first usage it may not record your steps when you not walking quickly . but past few days i also found it not always record vigorous walking either . it simply stops recording entirely times . i pedometer , costing less than half what this one cost , without all bells whistles , but it accurate dependable . this product not only not worth price charged it , but given its inaccuracy , not worth any price	-1

i'm very satisfied this lifetime basketball system . amazon free shipping great , but somewhat slow . i assembled setup unit myself , but times two people would convenient . if assembling yourself , just sure you few things like garbage cans or boxes support it when needed . i even raised hoop myself , which pretty easy . i found instructions sufficient , not terrible , but not great either . first thing i inventory parts nothing missing . there no extra parts either . i recommend you inventory parts if no other reason than become familiar many parts . some readers felt optional drill bit needed . this isn't case because all screws self tap also self drilling . i never used drill bit . but sure you good power drill drill drive screws where needed . i careful took my time assemble unit . i guess my assembly time 6-1/2 hours , i assembled it multiple times . there few confusing steps but little thought it fiqured out drawings . instructions mostly assembly drawings rather than step step detailed explanations what . hoop mechanism raises lowers ease . i filled base water system seems sufficiently stable . i spoke lifetime they recommend not using antifreeze . they said base designed withstand freezing water expansion contraction . i didn't use sand because fill opening so small i imagine it would quite problem emptying base sand if i move unit someday . i think this system excellent value , but i noticed amazon significantly raised price since i purchase mine 1 month ago	1

resident pacific northwest person new sport triathlon , i confronted unfortunate truth this winter - there not many good biking days after september . work , weather , sun deprivation , i finding it hard regularly fit trip gym ride , much less get my bike . minoura hybrid trainer tops my christmas wish list . i looked into other options , minoura seemed like good point entry . fluid/mag hybrid touted low noise " road-like " , but overall cost i still found affordable . i quite happy since i first unpacked it . my observations : 1 ) instructions simple actually written english ( welcome change over all-graphic instructions all too common ) . one point unclear use skewer ( crossbar through rear wheel ) . skewer provided , but my bike fit fine using skewer already rear wheel . 2 ) once assembled , it quite simple attach bike . i spend more time getting my shoes , shorts , towel my workout than i putting bike trainer . 3 ) balance stability good . i not any concerns , even when listening ipod or otherwise not devoting full attention . 4 ) most important aspect , workout , exactly what i wanted . i'm able get my heart rate up whatever training zone i want . resistance provided magnet smooth proportion effort i expend . need simulate intervals ? no problem . resistance changes nicely each shift gears . when workout ends , my thighs " feel it " like they would after similar length time effort road . 5 ) riser block nice touch ships same package trainer . 6 ) consider getting training aid encourage you vary workout . otherwise , it too easy get steady cadence not vary it through duration workout .	1

first , this beautifully designed built machine . rowing action smooth closely resembles feel rowing shell . it quiet easily adjust people differing heights . while machine large foot print when use , it easily fold into compact size storage or simply clear floor space . due quietness this device , it joy listen music or watch movie while working out . other exercise equipment i too noisy this . others stated , it easy under estimate amount exercise you're getting . even though i often end hour rowing feeling like i really haven't much , feeling my legs when standing up afterwards lets me know i've good workout . assembly time consuming , but not really difficult . other reviewers stated , parts high quality , finish fit excellent . three minor problems i've encountered easily fixed : 1 ) smooth cement floor , machine tended drift during long work out . carpeting or rubber pad under machine fixed this . 2 ) hard plastic handles become slippery when wet sweat . wearing pair cotton work gloves resolves this problem extra benefit protecting your hands friction handles . 3 ) shipped , foot straps tend work loose during exercise . this due assembly problem factory . when straps properly positioned , they don't slip . fix this problem , remove two screws ( one each foot plate ) hold straps position . while you're it , you might want reverse one straps so both buckle outside your feet . when you tighten straps , position them so back buckle touches foot plate . this leaves end strap going through buckle pulling same plane buckle . loosen strap , pull end buckle away your foot , increasing angle which strap enters buckle . straps loosen during exercise because factory setting leaves end strap pulling angle buckle . very slight change this angle sufficient loosen strap . note i didn't try replace two screws . replacing screws buckle properly positioned may make it easier tighten straps . despite minor problems mentioned above , this excellent machine well worth expense . it clearly deserves rating five .	1
this fine weapon average citizen who not inclined carry knife or handgun , but it cannot effective cane or police baton , two other alternatives consider . cane perhaps most innocent seeming yet it reach advantages over kubotan deal most damaging strike . above review good one , but please ignore advice sharpening keys using kubotan flail . this unlikely provide any real stopping power determined attacker . kubotan excels loadfist weapon , so use it enhance your hammerfist punch strikes . you also use point ' stab ' your attacker body points bony targets like back hand excruciatingly painful when struck . other words use kubotan like it intended so . nowhere any traditional yawara training it used like mini-flail like above poster suggested	1

when i purchased pair these gloves couple years ago , i high hopes . my hands become cold easily , i looking forward wearing gloves would actively help warming them . i admit these gloves respectable normal , unheated gloves . they fairly well insulated provide moderate degree dexterity . however , heating element ineffective . inserting batteries into gloves provided little ( if any ) increase warmth . my fingers remained cold . addition , i recently discovered thin wire connecting heating element battery one gloves become disconnected . these gloves not subjected any harsh abuse , so it disappointing find wire disconnected so easily . if you looking pair heated gloves actually make difference keep your hands ( including your fingers)warm , look elsewhere	1

positive : -size , good surface area -chipping netnegatives : -poor instructions -very hard set up yourself . really takes 2 people , because nothing fits tight , so you try get one side , other side pops out . -nothing locks . plastic caps hold rear poles don't fit tightly . ' male ' sticks go into ' female ' section rear poles not tight , so wind rear pushes it over . i make some modifications this item make it usable . i taped some eyelets bottom rear poles attached ring caribiners . i've tape caps onto top rear poles add some tape ends front pole make it snug	1
if you search keyword ' illuminator led flashlight ' , you'll find this same item offered varies sources wildly different prices . so naturally , you should just go lowest price , right ? not so fast ... i already bought one illuminator flashlight elsewhere ( see my " customer images ' above ) , going order few more gifts . lowest price i found here ' iggfactory handhelditems ' $7.95 . but during checkout , i found out their standard shipping handling fee $8.21 just one item . flashlight itself weights only 7 oz ., but company charges 4 lb . shipping weight . what rip-off ! such inflated shipping cost , you may better off buying this item local drug stores ( such walgreen ) $15 . least there you return item easily if you're not happy it . [ update jan 21 , 2007 ]: please check out my review garrity power lite , where i made comparison betweeen it illuminator . it my opinion garrity better flashlight .	1
this gun horrible . i bought this my friend let me tell you it waste $$$ . first off it 3/4 scale gun so it very small very light , if you drop it it would deffinitly shatter . also cocking system terrible top there lever you pull if pulled wrong spot it snap off then it would useless . when we end up shooting it bbs wentd straight 5 or 10 ft then curve down , so unless you going get within five ft person it useless , even if you get close he wont even jump fps more like 270 not 370 . also clip absolute pain load first you pour all bbs into chamber , then you pull down spring shake it upsidedown fot bbs gome onto front chambet then you release spring put clip gun . after 10-15 shots you take clip out repeat process . granted it holds 180 or so bbs you only shoot 15 time . over all this gun stinks . i bought it when it originaly 100.00 but list price 10.00 so i thought it going decent , but i wrong . spend your money elsewhere !!!!!	-1

first off , let me start saying i really like my summit watch . it large ( some may go so far call it huge ) but it surprisingly lightweight my wrist , quite comfortable wear . those bad eyesight still able see easy-to-read digital readout time , barometric pressure , altitude compass . numbers quite big , so they difficult miss . altitude reading measures increments +/- 1 foot , which good you get . i like . but what i really like highgear watches i haven't seen other brands which offer similar features , visual image face watch telling you what weather conditions or . no kidding , this watch actually show you whether or not it sunny , partly cloudy , or raining . pretty dang nifty if you ask me . barometric pressure reading only small part predicting weather , however after months use , i say my little watch way more accurate than my local tv weatherman . i'd say somewhere around 75% time what my watch says exactly what conditions actually . not bad . it feature i would very much like my suunto casio models similar functions . until then , i'll rely my trusty ( much cheaper ) highgear summit . if you considering making purchase wrist watch offers digital compass , altitude barometer functions , before making specific buy , some homework wherever possible , seek out store where you actually see watches person . able guess size particular model using picture computer possibly mess up your purchase . find best price , pull model out actually try it before you buy . me , highgear summit good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but smaller package , try highgear axis , or possibly more stylish but much more compact ( way more expensive ) suunto observer . either way , doing little homework pay off end . happy hiking i hope this helps you your efforts buy right product . good luck	1

this nice sword $35 ( plus tax ) . when i removed sheath , there some sort goo blade ( probaby so it wouldn't rust ) . this carbon blade , so don't leave it moist closet 1 or 5,376 years(by then rusted blade alone worth fortune ) . just dont get blade wet , ok . you rub moist towel across it get rid rust protector if you're going use it often but pretty much all you clean it without special kit . please dont brandish this sword around like bad actor kung-fu movie . you could realy hurt someone point blade . i think this shipped over seas , so dont challenge your friend violent battle day after you buy this you should fine . blue dragon actualy japanese video game no one bought . i think it based part final fantasy 2 . i don't want bore you video games , so i'll get point . put it display , dont cut your lawn it , dont play ninja it , dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try cut solid object half it ( prefrebly tin ) because cheap blade could fly off tang hurt you ( or prefrebly your neibor ) face . please don't throw blade your neibor either . p.s. i am not neil meislin , i am his son , daniel meislin . if you can't understand my numerous perenthesis , i guess you're not smarter than 5th grader .	1

this best air horn you buy because , unlike aerosol air horn cans , it never rust nor run out freon . i like this model this type because it smaller membrane diaphragm protected accidental tears grid cover large end . i keep one my 16 ft . runabout boat . i take one me when i'm diving . i would like see manufacturer make one half size especially scuba divers snorklers . my only complaint lanyard came off . so i drilled small hole just below lip small end inserted new lanyard . this product works great ! really loud !!!! it quite durable , but , plastic , it breakable it subject stress cracks ageing sun damage . but if you maintain it washing it occassionally keeping it out sun not knocking it around , it should last long time . if it doesn't-- so what ? $8 or so it cheap enough buy	1
ok , i got suckered reading good reviews net , over hearing trainer gym singing praises lipo6 . so despite i never found weight loss supplement actually worked , i decided i'd give it whirl . i amused previous review which says don't take it if you're already healthy weight ! well ... she then goes mention she very healthy 5'1 " 115 lbs ! but she took it ??? should red flag me . i must only one ( don't see this side effect mentioned elsewhere ) , but this made me total bear live ( ok , not word i really want describe myself , but it pg version ) . i irritable , daily headaches , saw no movement scale whatsoever ! waste money , waste time , waste quiet evenings home ruined my annoyed mood !	-1

i love this little metal bottle . it light-weight , nasty-chemical flavor free , lovely . it quite small ( what you'd expect 20 oz ) , so i'd probably get larger size next time . also , keep mind steel excellent heat conductor ; if you put hot things bottle gets just hot touch everything it soon cools . likewise , thing chilly hands if filled icy water .	1

i don't own this tent , but i owned other eureka tents past . many good tents , seams sewn together thread , but they not " sealed . " sealing means applying sort thick glue coat threads seams so water won't come through . some tents some sort seam sealer applyed factory , they say . i usually apply some my own , too . read instructions ; it tell whether seams or sealed , recommend seam sealer if not . you buy tube most sporting goods stores . ask salesperson advice applying i t.t here sometimes lot seams coated : top cover rainfly , floor , door , etc . - anything exposed outside . especially floor , cause you end up big puddle if it rains enough . sometimes you need reapply sealer after several years . if fabric , itself , starts leak , something like thompson water sealer make it waterproof again . but it also make it stiffer change color slightly . eureka makes good tents . if prepared properly , they don't leak . heck , even cheapo tents don't leak if seams sealed . only way you would get leaks if there holes fabric . then you would need patch them . if you take care tent when handling it , holes rare . but careless use lighters or cigarettes it	1

this very heavy duty , solid piece equipment . i no complaints how it works . it works fabulously , fact . but here some things you should aware before you buy ... one , it takes up quite bit space . not only frame itself , but also amount room necessary invert goes beyond " footprint " frame . so it not something you just tuck corner someplace ; it takes some room operate . two , it very heavy . note shipping weight over 80 pounds . removing table frame ackward difficult say least . you could easily strain your back removing it , which kind goes contrary benefits machine . so don't think you're just going remove table , fold frame store this under bed easily . i mean , it . but time you all , you exhausted may strained back . so plan this thing set up ready go full-time because it just way too much trouble break down storage . again , please understand i very much like this machine , thus five star rating . but these just things might not readily apparent someone shopping online i just wanted make sure you understand what you're getting . if you don't room leave this thing set up all time , it may not what you're looking	1
it great regular wide pushups , not so great close because your wrists still get some angular stress , but minor quibble . product very well made , light but solid , nice rotation very sturdy while use . i hadnt pushups well over year so this my reintroduction them . i felt my core got nice workout , too , especially obliques . i didnt realize it time but using proper form work core quite bit . it harder than normal pushup because you dip down much lower but makes it much more effective you work more muscles . 39.95 , this great investment . consider all home exercise machines thousand dollars more not effective perfect pushups . make no mistake , you still put work sweat get results but so far this exceptional . it took two weeks get mine because demand greater than supply but wait worth it . earlier you order it , sooner you get it .	1

just two road trips this case , carrying 5 pair nordic race skis 5 pair poles . longest skis 207cm , ( wheels recessed into bottom case take out some space , so 5 pair 207 wouldn't fit ) . also length case extended very close it maximum so it starts act like hinge center which unfortunate when your packing light weight nordic racing equipment needs more support . case comes one clevis pin connect two telescoping halves alignment holes doesn't allow second . i stiffened up center drilling adding second pin . our last trip i saw several these cases mine only one got munched airport conveyor belt , two out four corners caved bit but no broken equipment . wheels center handle both worked fine . bottom line : this case great typical alpine equipment . long classic racing skis , i would buy it again but it would nice see it evolve little stiffening up center connection reinforcing corners	1

i've using no-xplode 5 weeks now , it increased my performance gym noticably . mental focus you get this amazing , all i think one word : " gym " . my sister now takes it gym cardio , though that not my cup tea it her choice , i would think it fine use cardio . nitric oxide ( no ) , crucial supplement all bodybuilders/weight lifters ; widens your blood vessels accelerates blood muscles . this extremely good working out , i would also suggest taking protein your pre post workout , maybe even little when you workout . i first blue raspberry flavor after half bottle it very hard drink because taste just seemed gross . most people not like blue raspberry ( i've read lot reviews before purchasing ) . i am now taking fruit punch which my opinion 10x better tastes good . if you very sensitive cns ( central nervous system ) , i would not take this product unless you only took 1/2 - 1 scoop . i am very sensitive anabolics so i limit myself , just careful this it get you " too hyped " if you take too much . if you comfortable cup coffee or two espresso shots then i wouldn't even concerned sensitive cns . downside many people say this product makes you go restroom very badly . well , it usually make me take trip restroom , but it not extreme people say . i actually like it , clean system before i hit gym . it not like ex-lax , if you use restroom it probably within 30 minutes . i would recommend this product anyone who serious weight lifting . i would not suggest giving this anyone under 18 , but that only my opinion - it up you . rival no-xplode sizeon , i've never tried sizeon because i've never dissapointed no-xplode .. no wonder it rated #1 product year :	1

these cards awesome . we use these our poker club they great . every high end club i played uses these cards , good reason . although any brand marked or damaged , you really would work hard deface these . they also washable , so dirt , etc ., comes right off . i play least once week , 6-7 hours , we using same cards two years they seem just fresh when we got them . i tell you if you not used these cards , you might not like way feel ..... first . but then , you love them . you should keep mind there two different sizes . one poker one bridge . bridge cards smaller help you hold them all your hand . if you used poker cards , make sure you get right size , or they feel dwarfed your hand . if you play home game , these cards must . you won't buy set unless someone burns them . long run , you save not replace your decks . also , keep mind this cards glide very easily , so go easy when you start dealing until you get used them . best luck tables .	1

if you looking this light , you probably already familiar technology . basically hid top notch light . power consumption , durability , light output etc . this light made racing mountain bikes off road night . i personally use it commuting over dark snowy bicycle trails through wisconsin winter . i little reluctant part money , but i must say it worth every cent . i also vouch crash resistant mounting design ( long story . ) if you little wealthier than me and/or if you weight queen , you may interested higher end models which pair same light lighter battery technology . smaller battery technology would also better option if you intend helmet mount light . if you night biking only infrequently areas street lights , you probably get away cheap led light which generally make you visible others . but if you need light path your biking regularly , this definitely way go . it much cheaper than getting injured , you get home faster this awesome light your bicycle . one usage hint : i found little grease mount makes it easier pop light off .	1
i am very satisfied this produc t.t hese my first gloves extended finger length , which i find now big plus especially when doing wrist curls . wrist wrap works great me weak wrists . padding very good well , without it interfering normal hand fold . i read some reviews commenting how uncomfortably warm they would get when used ; i personally not felt it ; what i agree taking gloves off not easy . i found pulling fingers out first less difficult way . i actually wanted buy newer model which allows machine wash , but amazon not size stock . these minor details not demerit 5 star rating though	1

i purchased this watch/heart rate monitor month ago since used it pretty often . it pretty neat gadget since it combines watch , calorie counter , heart rate monitor , chronometer . it also light , which makes it nice . i bought it mainly heart rate monitor feature am pretty happy it overall . it reads heart rate fairly accurately ; my only complaint you not moving very fast order get accruate reading . if you running moderate/fast pace treadmill it hard time picking up signal sometimes it displays nothing , sometimes reading unreasonably low ( i.e. 65bpm when i know i 150s or 160s ) . but if you slow down walk where you better control over how you position your fingers over sensors , you most likely get accurate reading . overall i'm happy it use it long time	1

i using bowflex years . i am huge fan . although i rip xtreme2 my review it , i love ultimate . workout good maybe even better than gym . i'm big guy fairly strong . bowflex gives me great workout even challenges me . i honestly think its better workout than gym because this , i go very heavy not worry spotter or dropping weight me . you apply all bodybuilding techniques , including pyramiding , drop sets , rest pause sets , low reps , high reps , heavy duty , etc . additionally , changing weight cables quick easy , making transition one exercise quick , so you keep your heart rate elevated . i put alot mass since getting my new ultimate not too long ago . those who say you can't go heavy or can't get gym-type workout must not doing it righ t.t his equipment , if properly applied , give you kick a_ _ workout	1

i wear this watch constantly now ! i love how it warns you when you go over your planned calorie allotment day so you go work out automatically subtract calories it calculates your total , automatically bringing yourself back track . i also like learning how many calories i burn work , versus rest , versus during , say , rollerblading . really helps you budget your calories line your activities . it comes calorie index ( pocket-sized book ) contains calorie content all foods don't tend caloric content packaging ( ex : fruit , beans , vegetables ) grants you access their website which helps you appropriate expectations when it comes daily calories needed such ..... if you're someone who needs lot information when it comes motivation , or someone who gives up trying soon you feel like you " sabotaged " your diet , this excellent product because it gives you information you need undo your mistakes keep moving forward towards goal .	1

i recently decided i wanted retire my current swiss army knife , wenger standard issue ... i thought it would cool move up knife few more functions , but still not too many . centurion regular phillips screwdriver flat awl , unlike standard which just small flat head could handle phillips screws awl without sewing eye . this knife huge ! which my main problem . i wanted knife i could carry my pocket not weigh me down , this knife too large my taste . i would needed sheath carry it i'm not utility-belt type . ( i've already got leatherman super tool , if i wanted weight my belt , i'd just wear it there . ) blade much larger my standard , living up " folding machete " claims , but locking blade locking bottle opener/screwdriver nice features . said , this nice knife . blade sharp , it very light , it felt comfortable hand . i wasn't crazy composite scales , they feel kind cheap compared alox handles my standard , so i don't know how long they would hold up over long period time . this knife more suited residing pack outdoor activities like hunting , fishing , hiking or camping .. but it just too much every day carry item . i've also read some areas blade violates concealed carry laws . conclusion , this great knife , but not really suited my purposes	1
