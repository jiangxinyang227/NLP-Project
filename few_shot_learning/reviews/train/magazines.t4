even if you're " conservative , " you gotta admit this one worst magazines around . if you like good writing , don't even try this one . " one star " still too generous my opinion .	-1
i got this magazine gift , starting few months back . i really can't say i'm impressed . admittedly , i'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i still recognize good writing well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this isn't say i've never seen good point or anything , they're just fairly rare . if you want read well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this isn't it	-1
great filling doctors office magazine selection - if it free - but not worth your money own . i bought if gardening inspiration there really nothing gardens or gardening here . oh , once while they remember put garden shot magazine , but not consistently . home section isn't inspirational either . go it if it free , but if it not , don't buy it	-1

i decided i write review newsweek this morning , after i came across yet biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one entitled , " rethinking marriage crunch , " goes back everything they presented 20 years ago woman chances getting married later life . this undoubtedly very easy them they probably no evidence their assertion first time around , neglected any this occasion . i really think reviewer comparison people quite apt , but newsweek also provides reliably pro-sexual revolution pro-sixties counter-culture take almost every issue . two years ago , we made privy bit front page sensationalism concerning " infidelity chic . " yes , it seems , according their sources , spousal cheating all rage even though they argue , without even hint contradiction , everybody still wants get married much ever before . i find magazine [ ... ] they offer opinion instead news ; theirs mission persuasion . overall , there little which recommend this publication it geared readership trivial people who possess depth kiddy pool .	-1
i've subscribed self on-and-off 15 years , but recently feeling like i've outgrown magazine . articles seem focus issues facing single women who just starting their careers . fine , but not me anymore ! also , their subscription department terrible ! my most recent subscription plagued missed issues , double issues late issues -- customer service department can't quite pull themselves together .	-1
i received my first " issue " modern bride mail yesterday . it just cover magazine , nothing else ! now i'll go through trouble ordering replacement . yourself favor just go news stand buy one	-1

if i could give this no stars i would . i bought this magazine because nickelodeon programs my sons favorite watch . i bet they banking when they made this sorry exuse children magazine . not even half magazine ad free !!!! i bought this keep my son busy flight , he looked it maybe two minutes . i wondered why , since he loves everything else nick , so i looked inside myself . boy i dissapointed . instead quality children material i hoped , it just ad after ad . i'm glad i only bought one issue airport , instead one unfortunate people purchase entire subscription before seeing it lack content . if you want great children magazine , go ladybug younger children cricket older children . they both high quality they aren't stuffed full advertisements like nick	-1
one year subscription this magazine not renew it . simply because its vulgar materialism extreme . they say we americans obese body , but magazines like this show many also obese when it comes materialism . page after page glossy ads things we not need . rooms full what amounts dust collections . sure they make pretty pictures , but who wants all ' junk ' probably no real sentimental value but more what someone else told us we need feel whole or successful . i recommend magazine dwell which more holistic approach place live also wont mean hours cleaning . someone who professes so concerned down trodden , oprah would better set better example living simply . how many homes one american need , when so many americans cannot afford even one	-1

laptop magazine focuses laptops , pdas , wireless computing . laptop magazine seems like it trying both technical exciting ; however it lacks objectivity pc magazine deep enthusiasm wired . thus , it reads like series infomercials where each quot ; articlequot ; paints rose-colored view each technology vendors products followed paid ads same vendors portrayed so happily text . their conclusions all seem predetermined : new technology better	-1
i'm sure this review isn't unique . spin rotates same ten bands its cover , not mention ridiculous articles written within . time they get describing ' euro-punk-indie-pop artist just slammed them face their way train station their jazzed up sound ' i've completely forgotten point thier article . they must greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they tag onto useless music still manage say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need get out little more stop getting thier info mtv.com . i'm sure i've learned more what thier editors office any given day than anything remotely close music while reading spin . next time you see it stands , i suggest you spin direction	-1
spin anything try stay hip . i wanted gag when i saw picture blink 182 their quot ; tributequot ; kurt cobain mag . im huge nirvana fan only good thing those articles pictures . they poorly written dull . they didnt even scrape surface kurt music , his impact entire generation . i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin ..	-1
this mag people who think they computer experts because they change out video card or follow directions changing os setting . shallow coverage , some lamest humor you ever come across . it nothing more then rehash what freely easily available internet . there nothing original this mag , ever . also it tends copy paste much issue 12 months earlier . all main articles nearly same every 12 months . don't believe me ? take two magazines 12 months apart compare them . reviews also weak . nearly every month you see : fastest system we ever tested !!!!! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even slightest computers knows speed not most important attribute , even gamers . besides , it really matter system . 00005% faster their poor testing system then computer ? second star mr halfhills column . it only part consistantly interesting only person there real technical know-how . read toms hardware whatever tech news you want , learn how use search engines , skip this pointless mag	-1
this magazine all puff -- if you're looking honest insightful reviews , this not your read . however , if you already know all artists they profile just like pretty pictures them , this magazine worth buying sampler disc included every issue	-1
i am time person year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say reading time magazine like reading platform democratic party . actually it even worse than it like reading john dean diary , filled more fantasy personal wishes than actual reality . one latest online edition realists taken over washington . give me break . new set hogs come take over troff it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi her gang political hacks going help america fool . best thing we hope they create so much gridlock no one spend any money washington . maybe then they see america improves its own politicians both side make things awful . sad thing people read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something world . this publication so biased it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try repeat what they " learned " . if you want truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe economist . it probably not change your political affiliations but it least make you sound competent when you debate others . economist quite simply best weekly news magazine existence . articles well written people know what they talking . leaders around world read contribute economist . this something time , newsweek rest their ilk cannot claim . i am not affiliated any political parties not consider myself political . i look things economic perspective vote accordingly	-1
it would nice if i writing magazine content here but since i never received single copy my subscription . all i say their customer service sucks !!!! after repeated attempts correct delivery address or find out what happened issue still hasn't resolved . note;i've number delivery problems when ordering magazines amazon ( there might some glitch ) . however other magazines quickly corrected problem soon after contact .	-1
amazon ad said next day shipping . took over month first magazine arrive . not buy this amazo	-1
more more , all industry wants tell you what it you supposed like , ridicule anything we might consider guilty pleasure , if you indulge such thing , you ' shallow ' . music evolved past this attitude , no one believes this naked emperor anymore . oh yeah , their politics so mixed up , they don't even know what they believe anymore . i subscriber eleven years , my renewal notice came , i couldn't come up one good reason send it	-1
this used pretty decent music magazine . not best out there , but still decent . however , rolling stone taken huge nose-dive past ten or so years . i'm not sure i'd even really call it music magazine anymore . it more pop-culture magazine panders teeny-boppers . music magazine main focus should music , but rs over years started including more more articles tv shows , movies , politics , etc less less music ... especially less less good music . if you want magazine pop-culture go entertainment weekly . it , least , bit taste here there doesn't spout off politics . if i want politics , i'll read newspaper or watch cnn . i don't buy music magazines politics . i buy them music . if you want good music magazine , this isn't place look anymore .	-1
i subscibe this magazine . not renew it either ! maybe i am too old appreciate this periodical . it way overpriced even amazom , others discount	-1
... 1 ) i can't; 2 ) second thought , it deserves least one star some silly , funny stuff you don't find other magazines . said , it grossly overrated . how it consistently top sellers list ? well , there many millions folks below average iq there above average . it too bad they can't play up silly humor bit more while leaving abhorrent juvenileness out . images generally trashy sometimes airbrushed point it looks fake ridiculous -- they could improve quality photos lot . admit it , you would probably hide issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected . doesn't say it all ? reconsider standards you setting yourself , respect your own brain , too	-1

amazon sells one year subscription $14 which includes $5 amazon certificate you get later.in actual magazine , subscription card 6.99 one year or 2 years $10.00 so use card , save some money also dont wait your $5 back then find something amazon you use $5 certificate .	-1
they allowed me try one issue before i paid subscription . after i read first issue , i decided cancel . there couple good topics but articles poorly written , example , you couldn't see clearly what conclusions or recommendations . rest magazines all advertisements , which you get free internet ( or just anywhere )	-1
it several weeks still no magazine money !!!! oh yeah but they remember bill my credit card timely fashion .... maybe when something takes over month you should bill person when u ship product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i subscriber few years found alot articles repetitive not all educational . recently i subscribed shutterbug which much better magazine both novice professional photographer . its articles insightful even after many years they still teach this old photographer few new tricks !!!!	-1
i under impression this literary magazine would full fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , literary criticism . instead i received magazine discusses political issues . magazine know what it wants ? they recently released special fiction issue newsstands . why would they if they're becoming political magazine ? they want news/political magazines such time , u.s. news world report , newsweek or they want literary magazine ? they're doing poor job establishing themselves drawing line what they want . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . course atlantic staff , turning magazine into political direction probably bring them more sales . i don't think reading literary magazines dead any means but format needs revamped so people want read it .	-1
writer digest puts out lot great resources writers . magazine ain't one them , however . starters half magazine ads - mostly other writer digest products . one you get past paying $19.95 year what essentially brochure , you'll notice most articles don't apply you . most writers stick one genre , yet magazine focuses all aspects writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you're working biography . edgar hoover , you need look article poetry stlye ee cummings ? i'll take " no " $600 , alex . so , now you're down 10 pages might relevant . well , let start chipping away : letters grammar questions waste : if you question affect versus effect , would you write magazine wait month or two or would you pick up your style guide answer less time than it took you read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore idea someone would write magazine question like so incredulous one wonder if questions aren't just submitted staff members attempt fill space , like i used when i news editor my college paper . ) writer digest review software other technology might useful writers . my favorite when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i'm sure most readers no idea monopolistic word-processing program . fair , some reviews useful , although you get better information just looking up product amazon.com reading reviews there . if you're going writer digest market information , you'd better served elsewhere : annual writer market publication all markets more thorough , whilst writer market website all information up-to-date . your money would better spent those two products . only articles i found useful profiles authors how they succeeded . there you it : two or three pages issue useful . if you're trying get your work published , writer digest several other products better investment than its magazine : go annual writer market book , website , pick up style manual your choosing ( chicago best ) . don't waste your money this magazine	-1

where macworld bad , addict dreadful . it dumbed down level teen beat , " reviews " don't deserve name . extent which it drools over apple embarassing , leaving no pretence independence . like its competitor , it exploits crummy support typifies computer industry , so we get articles " secrets " such such product .

member southern family who treasured this magazine , it heavy heart sense loss i decided not renew my subscription this year . yes , i've always given brides our family subscription gift , waited eagerly my issue come mail . but those days past . southern living magazine offered all states some time now , i believe this caused editors try appeal broader readership . this , turn , changed recipe section into something one find any other magazine . honestly , i love all sorts different cuisines , but magazine called " southern living " , i expect find wonderful traditional southern recipes ! this magazine needs go back it roots . now , i'll giving new brides subscription southern lady magazine , that what i'll reading myself ! i miss christmas book , though .	-1

i not review something i not received . i thought i would received my first issue now but not . if when i receive magazien i order i happy review	-1
i yet see pw review anything not vetted pc police , not mention utterly stupid . when they want pan book , they apparently list criticisms they pick random , such " non sequitur " or " murky argument " or " reductionist " . they pick them throwing darts list writing down whatever phrases darts hit , ways prove they don't actually any understanding what terms mean . it especially annoying because even when it book i like , i easily see criticisms someone different worldview could make would valid , but they don't make them ; would require work . reviews so shoddy wildly inaccurate i thought asking amazon.com stop using them product info pages , but then it occurred me any book pw pans guaranteed good , so they useful backwards way . anytime pw praises book , i don't bother it , but if they attack it , i know it going great	-1
lucky magazine makes me feel not so lucky . it makes me sad i not afford all items they put their magazine . one month they tell me round-toed shoes show me 50 pictures shoes i would love own which 2 i afford . then following month lucky tells me round-toed shoes out square-toed shoes show me 50 pictures . you get idea ? this magazine based trends you broke if you try keep up feel bad if you can't afford all great things it showing . i enjoy lucky it profiles upcoming designers , some great website links , one or two affordable items it toss each section . i also got few ideas how wear clothing new different ways . most time , though , i felt sad envious after i finished reading it . these feelings i'd rather not encounter . i think i would enjoy it more if it more informative discussing quality differences items they showing , maybe testing them out different situations help me make best choice my purchases .	-1

i would agree previous reviewers , burgeoning ads this magazine over past decade made magazine chore read . number ads now easily exceed number pages devoted articles . it also quite disturbing note many those ads ( possibly 50% or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such viking ranges , bmw , oceanna cruises , trips bora bora ... wtf ? although i enjoy i luxury meal , i don't want go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine selling . ocassionally , behind clutter , i find useful recipe ; i rarely find interesting article . i am going let my subscription expire end current period	-1

i like read cook illustrated library . their magazine much too expensive small amount recipes included within . i like tips sent readers , some product reviews . i found most their recipes very involved -- nitpicky , kind . lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried their " america test kitchen " cookbook -- calls cooking cornstarch water , cooling it , then beating solution into meringue . supposedly this keeps meringue destabilizing . all happened my kitchen i found little lumps cornstarch glue bottom my mixing bowl while scraping out meringue . i made meringue before without cornstarch , can't help thinking this extra step isn't neccessary . their " best " brownies good , but i make equally good brownies without all extra steps involved melting chocolate cooling it , etc . if you're looking easy , fool proof recipes , don't take gazillion steps aren't fussy exactly what ingredients you use , this isn't magazine you	-1
i should preface this reveiw fact i am accomplished home cook . i cooking 25 years own more than 500 cookbooks . i not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect i am not target audience this publication . may/june 2006 issue 32 pages length total . given there only 6 issues year , i expecting little more than mere 32 pages . may/june 2006 issue contains following information : simplifying moroccan chickenbringing home fish chipsgrilled tomato salsagrilled london broilmain-dish vegetable stir-frieshow cook pastafoolproof veal scaloppinia new twist chicken saladsgarlic olive oil mashed potatoesutimate turtle browniesbest strawberry cream cakethe scoop vanilla ice creama review tongsif you experienced cook their isn't much cooking this issue new you . this issue contained not single piece new information me cooking . however , i enjoyed equipment reveiws find them informative useful . this magazine would helpful if someone inexperienced cook . bottom line , i not renewing my subscription unless future issues little " more meat " their content . i think this magazine overpriced what you receive . i would suggest saving price subscription buy their " best " cookbook instead . it costs same amount , contains many more recipes , many their equipment reviews bound hard cover so it hold up longer . additionally , check out issue " fine cooking " which test kitchen type publication , just more depth .	-1

there time when liberalism connotation deep thinking , tolerance , openness healthy , civil debate . no longer . harper perfect symbol all ails left . call this magazine " left leaning " farce . it doesn't lean ... it completely , totally , enthusiastically , blindly tumbles falls into " far left " swamp . tone often hysterically shrilly partisan , reflecting ongoing deafness disconnection leftist media elites towards mainstream america . quality writing feature selection declined precipitously through recent years . this rag credible now guardian , national enquirer , or , come think it , new york times ! save your money , lol !	-1

occasionally when i go grocery store i pick up magazine check out counter . so i bought issue fitness magazine then decided get subscription . i don't know what heck i thinking . each time i got issue i noticed there always some skinny blond chick cover wearing bikini . there never any women color cover . so when i sent letter , asking if i'd like renew my subscription , i said he11 no . i'm not wasting my money so-called fitness magazine doesn't feature women color its cover . there just no way . i thought fitness everybody , not just skinny blondes who wear bikinis . just because your skinny doesn't make you `fit ' either . skip this if possible	-1
i hopes this magazine would nice alternative others out there . moment i opened it , it felt so smug . i gave it chance read it cover cover ( april issue ) . but what finally me ( after read i could buy $800 blouse make me feel pretty after pregnancy stage , i could match my children shoes my jimmy choo finally i could buy my child latest $300 tricycle ) article entitled " normal " child who misdiagnosed autism . article discussed how distraught mother after her child diagnosed autism point she tried committ suicide . article ended fact child turned out genius . what point this article ? say thank god it wasn't true ? what those parents out there who autistic child , how this article make them feel ? article painful insensitive . there better ways spend you $10 than cookie	-1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1
i subscribe online edition you receive through email pdf form . i looking forward reading reviews latest audiobooks hearing what reviewers thought them . frankly i disappointed . reviews little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis , ( same info which might gleaned looking up title amazon.com or reading back book ) . reviewers add 1 sentence or so title call it review ... please . they also fairly out date . most audio titles reviewed older titles which out while . some titles aren't available anywhere i figure . whats point reviewing audio title you can't find ? my interest primariy sci-fi , horror romantic-horror . most titles audiofile reviews fiction . articles aren't particularly interesting . frankly i could care less what narrator thinks or feels , long they good voice . there also sort ... literay snob tone audiofile . i get feeling they like certain authors certain titles tend overly focus them . i'd really like see audiofile ' coming soon ' review column . it would very useful know what titles coming out future . i'd also like see more romance , dark fantasy , horror reviews , or least make section focusing different genres little more clear . i also think sections focussing children titles self-help little large . 2 stars . if you must subscribe , get online version . way you cancel anytime , don't worry subscription problems	-1
reviewers this magazine sometimes hit mark write style insight , but also there many shallow cheap shot reviews very anemic wanna-be true cultural wits like mencken updike . some reviewers suppositions sound though they grad student interns , havent yet lived long field writing form seasoned viewpoints supportable . i'd pass this superficial pop culture mag , save your money buy books nourish you .	-1
i've watching this magazine slide downhill some time , but they've finally hit bottom . bulk april 25 2006 magazine devoted cars . yes , todays automobiles becoming highly computerized , but magazine supposed highlight software hardware we use our desktops . pc mag drifting far afield , doing articles apple computers , gaming systems , extensive reviews cameras . instead pcs , subject seems anything computer chip it , or some way remotely related computers . obvious inference there nothing interesting going pc world , so they keep stretching just fill pages . i find hard believe ; i think it more likely staff lost their focus , or they've hired people who not interested or qualified write pcs . lack pertinent content makes dwindling size magazine even more apparent . what used rival small phone book now size time magazine . they now " new look " , it awful . their readership used consist well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people don't need dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , cutesy " handwritten " notes belaboring obvious . that more appropriate folks who hard time getting through high school short attention spans . compare this issue issues couple years ago , it obvious they've " dumbed down " entire magazine . i've subscribed pc magazine years , considered it " must read " keep up rapidly evolving hardware software pc world . but no more -- it time find one something useful write subject personal computers .	-1
my dad bought this magazine my mom i usually pick up copies browse them . all both my mom her fifties i my twenties browse it it joke . it not special it chucked full ads . cover stories dull boring many articles you would want read one paragraph good information . i find this magazine waste our money . it not getting renewed end subscription . my mom already stated .	-1
i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
time long increasingly superficial its news coverage , recent years only accelerated this trend . 60s 70s , it somewhat serious magazine centrist bend ( originally it considered quite conservative ) , but years go it degenerated into more more pop-culture fluff little substance . its part " liberal " media , this inaccurate . recent coverage ( 2004 ) election attempted reduce democratic candidate status non-person . first debate john kerry george . bush not even covered , except one very brief article listing few " fact check " points . instead , cover story wa new products movies , kind sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever election afghanistan . it mentioned passing article u.s. election , but i would imagine conservatives would object magazine ignoring signficant world event george . bush pointed one his accomplishments office . my view neither candidate received adequate fair treatment . bias seems favor mr. bush , but it still mostly bland superficial . your money better spent british magazine " economist " which far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint conservative , it sound fiscal conservatism rather than tent-revivalism currently substitutes conservatism u.s. politics . " economist " also provides liberal viewpoint closest i've found ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach news . time still entertaining read , but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously . they tend bend political wind	-1

this great magazine , but don't order it through amazon . they go through third party ( snapse magazine)that terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine january six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice told they no record order ( even though i received email confirmation amazon i 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it get back me . no one called or emailed me status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted if i just placed order told me it takes 6 8 weeks receive first issue . i won't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .	-1
practicing photographer not collector , i've very disappointed bw few occasions it crossed my desk ( i've never subscription , so i'm basing this just few issues i've seen ) . quality wise , last issue i received poorly printed - it contained streaks through images rampant misregistration , among other things . paper unimpressive printing itself - line-screen looks quite course . full-colour magazine , it would fine , but one which everything monochrome , i would expect they would print stochastically or higher resolution etc . terms content , every time i've seen this magazine it filled work which typically very well-executed technically but un-innovative un-inspirational , least me . most it hobbyist/dedicated amateur variety , few capital-a artists or professionals . stereotypical nature bodyscape-style photos seem dominate , few examples conceptual , thematic or `high art ' work , i've never seen any fashion or photo-journalism either . we could use more non-technical photography magazines , but bw caters audience obsessed traditionalism imitation old masters such cartier-bresson ansel adams . ps : reading body copy set futura tight leading real pain	-1

please read naomi jakobs ' review relevant magazine below . it captures so brilliantly eloquently heart christian ' post-modern ' kick . if you go out your way claim you're celebrity , then you simply aren't celebrity ( take " fitness celebrity " john basedow example ) . same way , if you go out your way claim post-modern evangelical movement relevant , then you're claim relevancy simply not credible . christian church certainly played vastly significant role past 2000 years . however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity isn't causing it any more relevant than it when sandi patty or carmen ruled christian top 40 . fact some christians enjoy latest musical fads make concept accepting human blood-sacrifice pardon sins more palatable	-1

i know apr supposed one better poetry magazines out there , i think it one highest circulations any poetry magazine , but it more national enquirer poetry magazines . it large , newspaper-style format contains mostly bad poetry dull articles . you'd better off subscribing poetry , hudson review , texas review , tar river poetry , or any number other journals	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	-1

i one entertainment weekly charter subscribers way back 1990 . it started out great -- different , intelligent witty approach entertainment coverage . but financially , things shaky , so magazine dumbed down bit reach wider audience . i couldn't blame editors . it helped them reach needed tipping point , they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication entertainment focus , i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew fallen off cliff . it become entirely superficial shallow , hardly any substance all . publication design also degraded into teen magazine format . i only imagine editors decided anyone over 30 no longer part their target audience . so , i've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning enjoyable magazine used	-1
this magazine shows negative side black men . i find magazine embarrasement african-american community . it seems out all races men world , black men seem want display their lack self control , their love fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which no way helps create wealth our communities . i am also offended this magazine rarely shows black women front cover . until , black men understand this kind pathetic display supposed masculinity stopped , they always stopped police , passed over employment , looked down upon . i wish someone would create magazine black men which shows positive side black man such leaders their community , showing respect love their women , showing everything not hip hip !	-1

my family received this magazine years , but recently we decided not re-new our subscription . this used quality product but it recently gone downhill inclusion more more advertising each issue . this point , nearly half magazine consists advertisements -- this isn't real science magazine it claims , waste money . content not all great . articles often extremely short , too short even pre-teen audience . my kids often wished this magazine included more serious science topics , not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much magazine full " fluff " -- things like word searches picture matching games , which didn't interest my children . content might okay 7-8 year olds children slightly lower reading levels , but older children bored . all all , i'd recommend you simply get regular , adult version national geographic . though articles might too complex children , pictures make up what they can't read . if you're looking more children's-oriented magazine , you're better off muse , high quality general science magazine published smithsonian museum washington , dc . however , muse caters slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 up .	-1

this magazine part murdoch empire . its worstsin its boring not very conservative . it founded william kristol , john podhoretz fred barnes tobe institutional conservative publication under tight controland deep enough pockets dwarf its smaller rivals . when conservativism living movement , it best characterized collection independent voices who while they respected each other didn't always agree witheach other . now , following murdoch formula , its aboutgetting many people whatever their ideology payroll . price payroll course not rocking boat . reading conservative publications these days like readingthe transcripts someone engaging monologuein echo chamber . its strange there so much " conservative " media today , but most policy decisionsdon't get debated or even discussed among conservatives . they seem more interested covering liberals than discussingideas or making proposals . god sake , no more articlesby those who agnostics their private life talking how america needs more god this or god . if yourgoing religious , least find someone who sincere . no more articles greatness family childless unmarried women who totally devoted careersto exclusion anything else .	-1
i subscribed t+l one year . my wife i found magazine uninformative little value when planning our travels . most magazine seems centered around places go shopping photos accompany articles artistic photos , usually models wearing $ 1,000 outfits , instead informative photos resorts or hotels . recommended travel products tend focus $ 1,200 designer duffels which , while perhaps within reach target demographic , unlikely survive many trips through major airport . addition , my subscription came unrequested automatic renewal . i didn't enjoy magazine nearly every copy my recycle bin within 15 minutes receiving it . however t+l decided i would somehow like renewal although i certainly never requested one . my book , those questionable perhaps unethical business practices .	-1
i would agree preivous comments state this magazine isn't worthy its title . i subscribed before reading review , i hoping find affordable psychology-based read , though some stories interesting i'm sure i'd able find them other magazines like vogue or cosmo . there plenty ads , probably more than stories . much like other reviewers when i first ordered it , it took forever first issue arrive , now its more regular but my subscription soon end no renewal course	-1
psychology today purports deliver latest trends psychological studies layman , but what it really delivers pop psychology whole lot advertisements . i give magazine one star very snazzy layout , second star hiring writers don't insult reader intelligence abusing alliteration ( unlike magazine supposedly aimed intelligent adults ) . however , content consistently concerned more pop culture than lives real people . i also noticed bias against introverts article after article attacks shyness serious character defect , rather than simply personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want avoid yet lecture how your way relating world intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )	-1

if i could give it zero or negative rating i would . when vibe introduced , it relevant , interesting magazine exposed me new alternative , rb hip hop artists . mag featured all kinds artists not just who hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles relevant not only hip hop community but world . lately i've noticed it nothing more than fluffy version source . i hate lot new rap music that out didn't appreciate mags rappers i dislike cover . it me or it seem like since mimi took over , all female rb singers ' covers stories horrible ( we won't even discuss disgusting brandy cover) ! this magazine sucks now only time i check it out while i'm line grocery store . yes , subscription rates cut bone now but because quality supremely lacking . i'd advise curious check issues out newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money subscription	-1

let me first say i am one martha stewart biggest fans ! i enjoyed msl magazine years loved format " old " show ( new one taking awhile get used ) . i jumped body soul when it first came out , but repeatedly disappointed obvious exclusion anything " male " articles . not mention , articles relationships love never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , just plain stupid marketing standpoint . why exclude men gay people ? i also noticed there no ads advertisers marketing men either . most if not all articles nothing more than " new age " pablum , either " borrowed " or stolen much better magazines such alternative medicine . don't waste your time or money this one . this isn't even good enough line my cat litter box	-1

kissinger , honorary chairman national interest , going head-up 9/11 whitewash commission , but he begged off when families objected . dov zakheim , 2.3 trillion dollar missing unaccounted pentagon funds man , journal board . one better off reading commentary magazine , where least " neocon fascist madmen " ( web tarpley phrase ) state their case clearer more honest - if that word - prose . i remember reading one article national interest which actually made assertion we , meaning usa , need engage terrorism occassion . i couldn't believe they would actually print something like , but they . this fundamentally dishonest journal waste time , most part , because it neither interesting ( statement described above paragraph notwithstanding ) nor meant , main , really other than fool public . kissinger i strong suspicion knows what happened 9/11 so i suspect zakheim ( put it mildly latter case ) , yet they pretend official version true . supporting this journal supporting bad guys	-1

time long increasingly superficial its news coverage , recent years only accelerated this trend . 60s 70s , it somewhat serious magazine centrist bend ( originally it considered quite conservative ) , but years go it degenerated into more more pop-culture fluff little substance . its part " liberal " media , this inaccurate . recent coverage ( 2004 ) election attempted reduce democratic candidate status non-person . first debate john kerry george . bush not even covered , except one very brief article listing few " fact check " points . instead , cover story wa new products movies , kind sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever election afghanistan . it mentioned passing article u.s. election , but i would imagine conservatives would object magazine ignoring signficant world event george . bush pointed one his accomplishments office . my view neither candidate received adequate fair treatment . bias seems favor mr. bush , but it still mostly bland superficial . your money better spent british magazine " economist " which far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint conservative , it sound fiscal conservatism rather than tent-revivalism currently substitutes conservatism u.s. politics . " economist " also provides liberal viewpoint closest i've found ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach news . time still entertaining read , but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously . they tend bend political wind	-1

i subscribed cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i problems issues failed arrive , wrote them it - never received reply or any note concern . since time , i occasionally glance through it newsstands see if there any articles interest . even dint casual glance , i've begun tire formulaic articles which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients order finally come up " perfect recipe " something or other . i now skip right " perfected " recipe , decide whether its worth committing memory . some explanations success or lack thereof inclusion or exclusion particular ingredient hare-brained bes t.t here also two other areas this magazine disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range just plain wrong idiotic . kitchenaid pro 600 hailed cook best its class many mixing chores . yet , amazon reviews tell different tale - one short lifespan when used mix bread dough because plastic gear cover deforms finally comes apart , allowing metal gears separate . christopher kimball ( editor ) once performed evaluation cookware which he calculated price cookware per pound its weight . no , i'm not joking . evaluation , le creuset came out top simply because it heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered not much heft , therefore judged pricey , pound weight basis . one issue cooks boasted its cover " unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others " . apparently , hershey designated best . not too many months later , callebaut recommended above all others , hershey judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there those dreadful editorials mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , punctuated picture mr. kimball wearing bow tie , looking very much if his head held it . mr. kimball humble man , much humble . he writes if he chanelling helen gurley brown , but red black flannel watch-plaid without her sense play . time re-vamp this magazine , folks	-1

back 1970 my grandmother subscribed prevention . time , it wonderful magazine , filled informative articles aimed " prevention " illness promotion wellness ( founder prevention , j.i. rodale preached ) . articles role vitamins nutrition light years ahead their time .

' son ) , takeover his wife daughter , it unfortunately transformed into fluffy , tabloid-like " women magazine " scantily clad women covers , one- or two-page articles instructing women get killer abs burn fat . i think j.i. rodale probably spinning his grave see what his descendents butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever what it used . i flipped through copy disgust recently note , reviewer stated , plenty ads drugs which really seems go against idea preventing illness first place ( whereas old prevention sang praises vitamins health foods ) . i don't know why rodale family doesn't just scrap title call it something else , but alas , they major corporation now i little hope this magazine improve any time soon	-1

i wish when i purchased this subscription i would read all reviews . unlike description included amazon website , subsription not include cd-rom , which costs additional $1/issue . , if you want purchase cd-roms past issues , they cost $4/disk . sometimes bargain isn't really bargain . buyer beware	-1

home business magazine publication aimed those members general populace who either already own home based business or who active interest subject would like pursue it further . this magazine contains articles relating all facets home business ownership initial setup all way through payment taxes year end . i read several different business magazines many them entrepreneurship . home business only one i read specifically devoted starting business home , unfortunately , it many flaws prevent it enjoyable informative read it otherwise could . probably most annoying feature this magazine articles themselves their tendency written list- type format rather than user- friendly way . i realize people like lists but home business takes this little too far . it makes magazine seem callous unfriendly- something you would consult same way you would almanac . example , it common find one page article title like " effective ways design newspaper ad " , or " how obtain quick financing " . each instance , these articles short opening consisting paragraph or two followed numbered listing different methods/suggestions solve problem or answer question . this makes magazine read more like reference guide than piece reading material . thing annoying this magazine endless advertising . not only it get out hand , it also includes all sorts ads emphasize money- making schemes other similar material . advertisements titles like " really lazy guy incredible little secret idea make you rich " , " free $9.95 report shows you how make fortune " , " six figures six months " clutter pages this magazine get- rich quick garbage everyone knows unlikely return even cost introductory package . some parts this magazine more bearable than others it this handful positive attributes prevent me giving this magazine one- star rating . i like some success stories because they depict ordinary people who succeeded making living home- based business . but even here , stories inconsistent . some educational nature while others little valuable information share . make matters worse , they far too short- usually covering only one- half page each large advertisement taking up space bottom each page . speaking advertising , this magazine wrote book advertisement excess . advertisements cover 75 percent pages each issue it rare see even two pages row without some sort advertisement . ads posted everywhere , often right middle article , they distract greatly already limited enjoyment magazine . this magazine assembled together such way it reads like collection articles taken people different parts country shuffled around published one magazine . other words , this magazine no continuity it . it like taking short articles different business newspapers around usa then piecing them together into one magazine . starting home- based business goal many people set themselves there always need some good , timely information when you find yourself this situation . home business , unfortunately , doesn't perform its mission very well . if you dig deeply enough you find few good articles . but majority too impersonal too shallow ( not mention smothered advertisements ) make this magazine worth trouble .	-1
when you watch commercial children television , you accept commercials because , after all , programs " free " . but when you pay subscribe nickelodeon magazine , i don't expect it so so full alluring ads targeting children . these ads appear similar editorial content . it seems like 50% pages advertisements ! i disappointed won't renewing our subscription . better look something highlights magazine series .	-1
like " where waldo " , it seems every issue must least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this admitedly classic piece furniture , one gets impression there gaggle designers telling their clients , " you one these , they're what ! " most features metropolitan home suffer same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes same dreary interiors obviously foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients designers who know how make easy buck . " modern " equals , course , mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month 1970 florals , faux louis whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through dreck finding something useable your own purposes , it painful look through this magazine . if you really want ideas making your house reflect you , trust yourself what you like , if you like mies van der rohe daybeds , all means get one . just don't plunk one your sun room because you told it trendy . if you like modern style , look up works hans wegner peter hvidt go there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years hard use real families sturdy well . maybe you want house where nobody allowed set foot any rooms amounts bad hodge-podge styles all seem bit busy bumpy . everyone else , think things you'd like see if you walked into room , save your money skip this magazine	-1
people magazine one worst expressions american life . instead makiing our own lives more meaningful exciting - which possible - people encourages us oogle fixate over people who essentially images , people we never meet , many cases people who very little going them . anyone really think britney spears anything say anything , or paris hilton barely aware her own existence ? it ever make whit difference your life how many times . lo engaged ( order get cover magazine ) or who demi moore grinding today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	-1

writer digest puts out lot great resources writers . magazine ain't one them , however . starters half magazine ads - mostly other writer digest products . one you get past paying $19.95 year what essentially brochure , you'll notice most articles don't apply you . most writers stick one genre , yet magazine focuses all aspects writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you're working biography . edgar hoover , you need look article poetry stlye ee cummings ? i'll take " no " $600 , alex . so , now you're down 10 pages might relevant . well , let start chipping away : letters grammar questions waste : if you question affect versus effect , would you write magazine wait month or two or would you pick up your style guide answer less time than it took you read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore idea someone would write magazine question like so incredulous one wonder if questions aren't just submitted staff members attempt fill space , like i used when i news editor my college paper . ) writer digest review software other technology might useful writers . my favorite when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i'm sure most readers no idea monopolistic word-processing program . fair , some reviews useful , although you get better information just looking up product amazon.com reading reviews there . if you're going writer digest market information , you'd better served elsewhere : annual writer market publication all markets more thorough , whilst writer market website all information up-to-date . your money would better spent those two products . only articles i found useful profiles authors how they succeeded . there you it : two or three pages issue useful . if you're trying get your work published , writer digest several other products better investment than its magazine : go annual writer market book , website , pick up style manual your choosing ( chicago best ) . don't waste your money this magazine	-1
i haven't recieved single copy so i can't really review it . all i say amazom service terrible	-1

i charter subscriber this magazine when it started up publication . it breath fresh air stagnant field almost universally wretched photography magazines . over years things changed . columnists died or moved . editorial directions switched . articles once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant marketplace , " outdoor photographer " vanguard , pushing every gadget photoshop manipulation plug-in popped up . magazine became wasteland promises better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill blank whatever current trend might ) . what i thought ironic time best photographs they printed photographers using least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film (!?) , lot large format guys , occasionally some black white stuff made cameras just any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began dwindle occasional rare almost non-existent . some point , my interest this garbage lapsed before my subscription . magazine made once monthly trip mailbox trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . " outdoor photographer " impresses people who measure quality photography whether or not equipment used production cost equivalent gross national product small third world countries . it offers little way nutrition hungry mind . it empty calories , just making you want more more while starving your potential . it truly wretched .	-1

i can't imagine how many hours my life i wasted worrying ego-trippin ' jocks . although , i understand how i got hooked this bad habit . rich folk who own our media great job marketing this endless diversion masses . so , instead worrying economic justice , environmental destruction , well-being children so forth ; passion large segment general public frittered away watching one city gladiators combat city gladiators . top , us vs . them pattern thinking encouraged , anthem singing , so many pro sports figures involved right-wing politics ( bernie kosar , john elway , steve largent ) , i've come realize how poltically-charged this so called " escape " actually . top , i just got sick all these sports announcers barking this or , wagging their finger my face . ads sports illustrated also bunch macho [ ... ] . way , before he killed " friendly fire , " pat tillman reading noam chomsky howard zinn books . fact , he arranged meeting chomsky after he returned our war terror . too bad he wasn't able pursue path . my interest sports now limited badminton my backyard , books like " what my name fool ?

friend once said me , " if you want glossy no brainer then get vogue ! " how right she , despite glorious photography , fashion models daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't able see them occasional good article it , i admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants voice fashion , voice high brow media but its clientele likes you me , ordinary people who can't afford live high life they portraying its gloss filled pages . personally i'd rather spend my money movie ticket , i get see good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i don't know substence abuse emotional demons haunt particular actor life , i'm just interested enjoying myself couple hours before i go back my hard working life real world . vogue trying sell me dream i don't really want buy into , never penchant selling my soul devil , it gets two stars though because photography really superb , shame rest it though	-1

i've receiving this magazine almost 4 years now . it hasn't changed much since i started receiving it ... i pretty much still think it worst teen magazine that still business . i'm 16 now haven't liked it anymore i've gotten older . strangest part this magazine me fact they just keep sending it me ! i mean , i barely even remember when i first subscribed it ( it some kind deal where you get certain magazines like 6 months or something , i didn't many choices so i picked this one ) . eventually other magazines stopped coming . but this one continued come . still ! i would thought it might nice if company made accidental error or something continued send me magazine . i would thrilled if happened any other magazine ( i actually don't mind seventeen , allure , cosmogirl , teenpeople occasionally , or even teen magazine . ) . but this one just makes me wonder if these people downright stupid ... least they could " accidentally " send it someone who likes their magazine ! if person exists ? i think i read fairly broad variety teen magazines these days , so i'll try discuss my dislikes it relation those . so this comparison this one versus : seventeen , cosmogirl , ellegirl ( i suspect it recently went out print however ) , teen magazine , teen people magazine , allure , cosmopolitan , jane magazines . 1 . overall valueconclusion : teen vogue = very low value overpriced . smaller sizefirst off , one easiest things see this magazine when its shelf fact it smaller then others . all my magazines same size . except this one ; which maybe much 2 inches shorter height 1 inch smaller width . i don't know why magazine makers decided this . my opinion , it only draws more attention fact while it around same price other magazines ... they cut out least something make it smaller . sounds like rip off me . ( ... but i'm getting it free some reason , so i guess that hardly my biggest concern . it may yours though ) . cost compared contentmagazine prices little missleading first glance . it easy find thicker magazine assume more pages = better value ? but that not case . abundance ads magazine lead you conclusion , but there good chance you'll disappointed when there hardly any articles ad after ad after ad . way ... those you who aren't familiar teen magazines these days , i hope you realize : they all adsthis truth , but i don't see it terrible thing personally . when i 11 i first found issue teen magazine library , i shocked ad content . but i used read american girl magazine ( which no ads ) so i thought it so bizarre . now i don't mind it . i even save some ads because i like photography looking different angles things . i don't think it fair however , hate teen vogue solely because ads though , all magazines going ads . amount ad content each one main thing varies ; so here my interpretation ... seventeen , cosmogirl - limited ad content ( they more ads towards beginning , then they're much more spread out . seventeen probably my favorite magazine bunch they manage get one ad opposite article few pages then stop ads few pages or so before they it again . i find it highly tolerable)teen magazine - even less ad content . ( i think they've really decreased amount ads over years actually . they probably least ads all my magazines)teen people , ellegirl , jane - more than seventeen cosmogirl but not terrible . allure cosmopolitan = high ad content . ( i almost put them seperately , but they similar . they lot ads i think , but most part , i don't mind . they manage balance most it out enough articles pictures make buying magazine worth while . main difference i see just choice ads . cosmopolitan puts so many ads sex related things many more vulgar ads . allure i like more anyway . i guess cosmopolitan magazine focuses whole lot more sex already , so many teen moms may not appreciate their daughter reading it first place . ) teen vogue = high ad contenti'd say ad content very similar ad content cosmopolitan allure . however , thing pisses me off , fact there isn't enough content balance it out ! ( maybe i mean " meaningful content " but more later ... ) . saddest part this magazine i save more ads then i ever save articles . ads really more exciting then content unfortunately ... 2 . articlesconclusionteen vogue = fluff filled , unimportant menow , generally , i consider seventeen best articles ( cosmogirl close second ) maybe allure although it addressed older crowd . reasons why i actually take time read seventeen articles , although i hardly even bother teen vogue ones : . seventeen writes something actually interests me ( ok , ok , so occasionally they little stinker . but overall , i think they good job . ) teen vogue ... not . i'm interested things i haven't thought before , or personal accounts things i would unsure how react , issues seem happen everywhere but stunning new facts enclosed statistics give me perspective ... etc . i could go . but unfortunately , i don't think teen vogue managed intrigue me . ever . typical teen vogue article something like " truth crystal meth " , " i bullied online ! " , blah blah . i hardly even think anything i've ever interested . they tendency focus things i already know bad , things like drugs especially . it makes me feel like i'm babied ... like " hey , well i bet you didn't know this .... if you this your liver could turn black blue all colors rainbow " then pile bunch tear jerking stories teens who " no idea " dangers _____ drug then something terrible happened . i mean i think it important teens see dangers doing such things ... i just get annoyed rather than enlightened when it seems like such easy obvious thing . particularly when they make big deal it so " unknown " mysterious like nobody ever heard it before , when i know most people i talk every day anyway . if i don't take freaking drug ... i won't worry all problems associated it , sometimes it hard me sympathetic these girls who screw their lives up ( especially when article , they make themselves seem like complete idiots ! ) . i'm not anti drug articles though either . when seventeen one while back , example , it article ( or maybe more chart ? ) " drugs make you ugly " . now i found enlightening very interesting . it didn't focus one drug , but instead one effect many different drugs cause . not only i want use drugs less , i also feel like i'm more able recognize signs its use , so i could identify signs . it important me magazine editors take time teach us something new , without beating us over again same stuff we hear everywhere else . teen vogue just hasn't figured out ye t.b. i find good advice seventeen meaningful . teen vogue ... makes me wonder if i should one giving them good advice ... i think i most disappointed teen vogue this when they article caught my eye girls who addicted tanning . they spent nearly 2 whole pages rambling different girls their tanning habits ( general stupidity ... ) . barely even gave reason why it not good idea . i remember reading one last sentences my head over over again . it like " remember live your life fun , but try safe " . i mean wtf ??! you could talking anything . cooking , driving , sex ... it so generic it stupid . only thing i got article justification there really lot stupid girls who damaging their skin tan , no idea it . unfortunately , if these girls read teen vogue , they probably never know either . 3 . featuresconclusionteen vogue = ... you serious ? um . i can't find better word than worthless describe this magazine features . i used like " room my own " thing they back my issue . it nice inspired way other girls kept their rooms based what they liked . but last year ... i think they managed totally kill part too . uniquenesses interesting things once intrigued me little replaced more mediocre rooms other girls ( lately they've somehow connected famous person . yeah , how exciting ... not ) just don't inspire me all . oh , one second last pages or so , there feature where they find some girl " style " tell her describe it what brands she likes ... blah blah . occasionally ( well , no , rarely ) , there something i actually find interesting want save remember . but most time it just bunch 13 year olds trying trendy throwing coolest things they know ... all same time . no thank you . most other magazines , i appreciate monthly space something hair , or makeup , or something related beauty i could find useful . teen vogue not this . but then again , everytime i seen them slip something those lines , they manage make me question their intelligence . ( " omigod , mom ! teen vogue says i should put glittery pink eyeshadow up my eyebrows so i cool . we go spend $67 now so we exact product they used ! " eek . ) makeup useful ... if you want stage artist perhaps ? i don't know ... i'm still working one . 4 . fashion focusconclusionteen vogue = fashion help extremely wealthy confusedif you disregard fact virtually everything magazine rediculously overpriced just unpractical ... i suppose someone might find their fashion sense useful/inspirational somehow . but i'm afraid i not . i remember skimming through one article answered question asking " how i avoid looking like tourist vacation ? " which they answered showing how you pile bunch random clothing pieces come off idiot instead . how exciting ... they also tendency encourage readers buy things showing us models wearing such clothing . i wouldn't surprised if plus-size community completely gave up them , fact i'm surprised there no outrage over this . look teen vogue , i know gemma ward looks excellent ( ok , i'm lying ... but i pretend , right ? ) . but you see , me gemma , we some differences . example ... her thighs probably less then half size mine , she like half foot taller then me , she weighs maybe half what i , ... well ... she model seems look good everything . i not . i refuse let you convince me such hideous outfit won't look hideous anyone else . actually , i wonder if gemma ward could afford things their magazine . she super model afterall . but maybe after spending $150 each pair underwear ... things begin add up , even her . darn ... bottom line:don't waste your money this magazine ( fact , don't even get it accidentally free like me , it not worth your time ) . if you want buy teen girl magazine subscription , try something like seventeen , cosmogirl , teen people etc . just anything better than this .	-1

i reading this mag off past 20 years . other reviews said , i think i am just reading same tired old stuff three or four issues ago . " big guns ! " " huge chest ! " " massive gains ! " these seem ones you'll see featured every other month here . adds ? don't get me started adds ! when half your magazine adds , it spells trouble . not only , they need specify people who may not already know , " this mag training tips people who not work living spend 6-8 hours day gym , eat 8-10 meals day spend massive amounts cash supplements . " other words , people no real responsibilities other than taking care their physiques ( which far jobs go , that great one ) . i teach all day into night , literally , me eat train like they require , i'd quit my day job , sell my kids into slavery , become homeless person . which case i'd no money gym membership . i think you get idea . positive side , photos awe-inspiring . also , realistic , it mag around decades upon decades . how many different ways you say , " lift heavy , eat like horse , train like you no other responsibilities life " ? it just becomes repetitive any way you slice it . my recommendation would buy issue or two every decade or so . buy january " big guns " issue , then february " huge chest " . then wait decade repeat . good luck	-1

i'm not sure why this magazine so highly rated . sure it o.k. magazine , if you like immersing yourself hype , marketing-speak incredibly superficial language . admittedly pictures pretty obsessed mountain biker i say we like bike porn . i just cannot read any articles . chock full over-the-top adjectives ' xtreme ' language . i don't trust magazine calls every new incremental advancement biking technology ' revolutionary ' or ' amazing ' or any number disgustingly inappropriate modifiers . they ceaselessly use vapid ' technical ' jargon made up sound high-minded high-tech , but nothing more than marketing spew . tech advice column full suspicious letters stench stealth advertising . if there one thing that well thought-out this magazine , it how best bombard reader sales pitches , half-truths hype . short , this magazine blatant industry propaganda . my first advice : don't buy it . if you buy it ( love god ) don't take anything those covers seriously .	-1

if i pick just one women magazine subscribe , " good housekeeping " would one . it many same articles all women magazines : articles health , fitness , finance , relationships , diet , beauty , fashion . but " good housekeeping " goes beyond surface these articles , example , their fashion articles don't focus just high-priced clothing , instead they show outfits look like their expensive counterparts readers buy just fraction cost . there also advice columnists things like household hints , etiquette , relationships . each issue also short story . there also seemingly obligatory celebrity cover interview inside each issue . what i like " good housekeeping " in-depth articles . most magazines today publish articles only page or so long , but many articles " good housekeeping " several pages long . articles often ordinary people making difference world . there usually cautionary articles parents young children and/or teenagers frightening ( recent article sexually abusive male babysitter ) but very useful . many magazines , good housekeeping also on-line counterpart , where readers post messages current issues well enter contests . well worth subscribing .	1

" ; quote : " media say i won election strength moral values . if other fellow become president , would media said he won election strength immoral values ? " ) . all seriousness , this magazine very clear detailed neo-conservative look issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear many writers used liberals ) . magazine not always present just conservative perspective , not always agree bush . recent article current liberal , ex-communist british writer his reaction george galloway testimony before us senate . editorial recent issue all dictator uzbekistan , us ally war terror . editorial notes toleration this dictator his brutality undermine bush current foreign policy . it should noted magazine not seem journalists , few staff writers , most appear called " contributing editors .

i discovered am some 2 or 3 years ago . since then , i become addicted reader it . more than any other magazine moment . let start saying what am not : not news , not business , not nice colored pictures . am two main focuses . one current affairs , special focus macro conditions us ( mainly economy politics ) international affairs . other one arts , special focus reviewing high-quality ( sometimes rare ) books . i like am its focus current affairs . this monthly you read long articles issues like , cite some examples come mind : - simulation principals meeting discuss alternatives engage north korea- war game attack iran- presidential candidates , their lives their campaign strategies- state affairs american educational system- potential causes eventual economic crisis usthe am sits same " hall fame " economist foreign affairs . main differences economist relatively short time frame thus focuses news week what they mean mid term . foreign affairs , other hand , more scholarly nature . am sits somehow middle . it written mainly senior journalists ( so it less scholarly ) its monthly focus allows it disentangle itself relative " sameness " every week news . am goes beyond " futility " news reporting but stops before it gets into " boringness " scholarly writing . if you want enrich your view world quality monthly , if you open-minded willing read new points view , if you want get closer real issues behind foreign economic policy , am you . other hand , if you more " shor t-t erm " preocupations , if you more " closed " than open new points view , or if you want look international economic matters more scientific approach , then am not you . again , i said , am also " arts " section . it very good but it not reason why i buy it . other may	1

excellent independent research ! investigative journalism its best . it neither liberal nor conservative publication , neither republicans nor democrats spared . politicians make lot claims , mother jones looks beyond their words see if they actually put them into action . you see when you read mother jones , many politicians ( both democrats republicans ) not " put their money where their mouth . " also , ignore reviews saying it biased . apparently , they consider facts inconvenient run counter their beliefs biased . what interesting if they came across article mother jones supported their beliefs , they agreed , then they would probably say article impartial fair . hey , truth hurts sometimes . finally , reviewers claiming this liberal magazine because it talks bush so often misguided . mother jones so many articles bush because he makes so many claims says so many things not supported his actions . he easy target . they articles kerry others too .	1

i came across " olive " when i london this past may ( 2005 ) . it free supplement month issue " bbc good homes " , so i wasn't expecting much originally . am i ever glad i didn't just toss it bin i would normally ! " olive " devoted cooking , my title suggests , simple , elegant healthy . great editorial photography makes food look great , all its ' recipes use readily available ingredients . each recipe short , telling you what you need how prepare it , not much more . sidebars or runners bottom page contain info related recipes , such how cook perfect steak ( i.e. , " bring steak room temperature ; use very hot pan " " oil meat not pan " ) . under section " fast food " , one these recipes mini wellingtons , only 5 ingredients ready 30 minutes . section details how make signature nobu ( famed sushi restaurant nyc london ) dish , cod miso , recipe isn't all intimidating ( although obtaining some this dish ingredients might difficult unless you access asian market or similar online site ) . gi diet followers also benefit " olive " nearly all recipes contain gi-related nutritional information . chef gordon ramsay also edits column shares his favorite tips recipes . only reason i give " olive " 4 stars instead 5 because many recipes contain both metric imperial measures . however , conversion info metric measures easily available online . " olive " also uses british stove/oven indications , such " heat oven too 200c/fan 180/gas 6 " but i easily able convert these fahrenheit . so why subscribe " olive " instead american cooking magazine ? if you like me , american cooking magazines frustrating , recipes often ( unneccessarily , imo ) complicated , better suited those who cook purpose entertaining large groups people . many healthy cooking magazines don't contain gi index info , fail present it easily understood way . many cooking magazines ' this side pond ' also chock-full ads , you get through them before you get recipes or information prompted you buy mag first place . " olive " clean , uncluttered , appeallingly presented . what not like ?	1

" fortune " classic newsstand , vital important today ever . " fortune " generally caters people managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis current events business world , global national economic climate , forward-looking technology trend information . each issue normally organized around theme or major story , like enron trial , or 100 best companies work given year . i enjoy articles where they rank things , but more than rankings themselves , i am always interested justifications they use their rankings ; while i don't always agree magazine , i always find it good food though t.t he features generally very polished accurate , lessons conveyed straightforward manner useful ceo college business student . i particularly appreciate interviews " fortune " key players financial industry , also appreciate very useful index companies individuals featured every issue . magazine probably not favorite investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want read more specific magazine like " kiplinger . " nonetheless , investment advice insight " fortune " offers should generally held high esteem . i also appreciate coverage key trends , particular want note " fortune " lead excellent reporting pension crisis america : coverage this sort what makes me loyal reader . many other financial magazines available competing your money ; while there several i would recommend , " fortune " remains reliable source information macro-level trends , should part everyone business library	1

this magazine great ! sport-specific magazines , this probably one best i seen . yes , photos large detailed . but , kicker writing . incredible content without wordy . variety topics approaches brings out varying highlights sport . just very impressive	1
if you looking more opinion than straight reporting stats rather than highlights , tsn your sports magazine . years back , tsn seemingly slated go way sport magazine ; one couldn't find niche internet cable era , which ultimately would spell its demise . it also took tsn take body blow usa today - when its baseball weekly cut into readership - overhand rights espn magazine find its way . tsn truly survivor . in-season reporting not based editor deciding what hot . those seeking out quick hits - example - auto racing don't wait indy 500 or nascar chase information . my biggest criticism reliance lists - best , worst , etc . - tend become major stories when certain sports ready crank up year . granted , many radio-talkers pick up lists - oftentimes give compilers time gab it - but these features ultimately fall into " lazy week " gathering news . overall , though , tsn better than ever product any sports fan would find informative .	1
well i echo what all other reviews said this magazine . subscibing this magazine making sure unbiased articles still exist all makes models sports cars . you see there extremely few ads this magazine so even though mag bit smaller than say car driver magazine it loaded front back reviews . one after . photography fantastic just looking pictures makes you wonder what some other mainstream magazines could like if they could just try put out better quality product . even cardstock paper first rate . it makes car driver mag feel so cheap comparison . both come my address i honestly say i look forward both but different reasons . i first stumbled upon this magazine airport 6 years ago i am so glad i . i would love see more articles affordable sports car alternatives they print end each issue . i remember article what used sports cars you could buy certain dollar amounts this me ( man budget ) rather nice look market whole year . also we not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing this magazine so it would nice see road tests least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue . thank you putting together such high quality magazine your readers enjoy .	1

yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como , seventeen , cosmopolitan , vogue , self , glamour , mademoiselle , teen , lucky , teen vogue , marie claire , por mencionar algunas , tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol definitivamente me quedo con elle . es superior las demas , primera tiene excelente fotografia muy buenas impresiones , su moda es cosmopolita global , ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente la fama , sus propuestas reviews sobre cine , musica , libros teatro tambien son muy buenos , tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes de ahi no salen . sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran las drogas , tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 1 millon de dolares , por favor pongan algo mas accesible economico . tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos , ya sea de salud , relaciones , sexo , belleza , politica , cultura o decoracion , estos son variados algunos son muy buenos , otros aburridos , otros son superficiales o estupidos , otros son solo trivialidades . pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena , pero eso si es muy elitista , esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio , que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad , que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas , diferencia de cosmo , glamour , marie claire que claman ser feministas en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas , elle si les da un buen lugar sus lectoras , en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo tarugadas de como contentar tu hombre , amigo o lo que sea , convertirte en una barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar	1

when funds tight i difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions keep . each women magazine slightly different feel writing , though increased competition , these styles seem flux . i finally decided i preferred writing bazaar getting tired what i felt vogue cosmopolitan attempt catch larger readership ( if i want subscribe cosmo , i'll bloody well subscribe ) . featured designers more cutting edge less mainstream than what found vogue . it bit snottier ( though there far snottier magazines if you looking extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar obviously thinner magazine , while most vogue content adverts , it seem more articles . item i find highly irritating , bazaar society items . i really don't give ---- who wearing what what charity gala , especially when i don't play footsies these people . those complaints aside , this still my favorite fashion magazine	1
newsweek easy read interesting magazine . however , it not balanced economist or time magazine but come up some interesting articles developments worldwide . if you ignore conservative slant magazine , you enjoy coverage analysis various current world events . newsweek helps me keep up developments diverse range subjects including business society , international affairs , politics , arts other areas . i also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature . magazine helps put news into context . instance , i often frustrated during recent israeli-hezbollah conflict lebanon i could see news tv but not understand story behind news . however , after i read conflict newsweek , i got know background going back into decades i could now appreciate all news stories their proper context .	1

us weekly used cross people national enquirer - ever since new editor stepped ( it seems they new one every year ) magazine revamped . it looks more like classy people less like trash tabloid . i'm also little skeptical those who complain amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines . not every business perfect , but i haven't problem my magazines delivered when i've ordered them amazon.com . it just makes me think all people whining just taking out their frustrations life amazon.com . maybe its why we see so many vicious jealous reviews , if you don't like your life change it . don't complain it , that how most people get where they today . anyway , unlike people , us weekly mainly focuses celebrities i think its price its far too short . least people thick . anyhow , celebrity junkie , us weekly must read . like reviewer , i too am tired reading jessica simpson brangelina . i think celebrity magazines tired this well . i'm starting see more diverse focus celebrities magazines . its certainly much better than reading touch life style weekly . although i like us weekly , i still think people best . people more classy , great layout , their focus 50/50 celebrities articles average folks . they great photos other interesting reads their magazine . even their website great , us weekly website looks like barbie website . recent changes great but if us weekly really wants compete people then it needs step up plate more . despite its faults , us weekly luscious read worth all its frothiness , so enjoy it .	1
(...) other magazines write similar topics outrageously priced their articles misleading you never learn anything actual relevance topics cover . one prime example this us weekly . i read several issues this past usually way someone giving mag me when they it i've actually only personally bought us weekly twice . but it style annoys me it magazine wants write interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails . please not confuse touch us weekly . what i sometimes think other people might easily dismiss touch like us especially since they sometimes feature same celebs right next each other newstands . touch keeps you " touch " celebrities their important/interesting stories happening week week their lives . but you don't feel like stalker or something reading this magazine i read other people comment us . touch always stays safe distance celebs personal lives not cross line their articles no matter who or what article written touch keeps up respectful tasteful point view subject/celebrity hand . they also talk important things public eye , such this weeks issue these few stories : people news section : cynthia nixon brand new life - this article talking how cynthia now found love happiness her life her lover woman . i no clue this till reading article . article just tells straight up facts , quote one cynthia friends saying " she totally love nothing hide . she two beautiful kids , money bank , incredible career , emmy career , now girlfriend . so cynthia , life couldn't better she wants share her happiness world ! " , nothing bad said article .. you tell , quite opposite . this way touch handles itself - it tells facts more happy things celebs lives less worse . but what i meant before it talks even no celeb issues this next story people news : * under survivors heading*montana plane crash miracle - man woman first presumed dead plane crash , but woman , jodee hogg managed free herself plane wreckage then free fellow parks co-work matthew ramige . they stayed anthor fellow passanger while he died then left get help walked two half miles - matthew broken back burns . it really amazing . kelly ripa advice working momsis joaquin still mourning his brother ? prince harry gets seriousmary kay defends her crimethere cover story . lo jennifer garner what . lo thinks " bennifer 2 " she still love ben . but even handled respectfully closest thing it gets sensationalizing it page entitled battle jens but it more fun than anything plainly obvious . here few more headings articles within mag - i think they pretty self explanatory so i'm just going list them : you friends your lover ex ? - three not crowd renee , jack his former wife , meg . fashion trauma - even celebs strike out , but these oops outfits saved ? why chip kim win $1 millionat home kelly osbourne - her pink paradisejerry favorite food stop - crossing jordan star jerry o'connel takes touch carney lathe 10 sexiest men season - it raining men this autumn , hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over big small screens . what makes them best ? she plus-size model proud ! - america next top model toccara happy just way she . fatherhood changed my life ! - mark wahlberg talks his journey crotch grabbing bad boy devoted dadis tyra next oprah ? several more . i especially like section : it true ? - real story behind hottest gossip . you read this know what told truth . i noticed way more celebrities open up allow touch interviews tell them first hand facts than * other * magazines . also featured this issue article kevin costner wedding reception fair last weeks focused more his wedding this one more reception . it featured different pics/angles than last week so it not recycled material . katie wedding dream finally coming true ? - now her boyfriend divorce final , america favorite sweetheart free tie knot she couldn't happier !

while many mainstream publications shying away calling members current american government into account their transgressions - bribery theft misinformation cover-ups sexual escapades - " nation " its job reported facts . its trouble , many those who lean same way current administration lambast magazine " too liberal " " naively progressive .

this my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine all time . perhaps it fortuitous coincidence , but " cottage living " always features homes areas country very interesting me - like adirondacks , boulder co , arlington va , asheville nc new orleans . editors good understanding cottage admirers their interests . therefore , they include floor plans , before after pictures , brief back-stories give us glimpse into life cottages their inhabitants . we get see cottages very different characters based their geographic region , their original purpose , style socioeconomic standing their owners . some homes really stretch definition cottage because their large size , but - usually - they convey spirit snug informal home anyway . we see cottage owners very ingenious using all interior space available . i love see how people used dormers , areas under staircase , other niches things activities would otherwise not practical because limited square footage . small space used wisely attractively challenge all cottage owners face . this magazine provides ideas galore . [ one thing puzzle annoy me magazine presence food articles . what living cottage - or wanting - anything type food anyone wants prepare ? i see no connection all . furthermore , recipes provided seem very labor ingredient intensive . i'd rather few more pages houses ! ] highly recommended !	1

like one commentor said ... " truth hurts " . it ... if you're happy your martha stewart scott peterson news , not buy this magazine . if you want real dirt , left or right wing ... this it . they shoot hip . if you want truth not what you see mainstream media , this magazine . they well known publish stories ny times afraid publish . matter fact , most writers mother jones nation used write times . i just heard last week two stories written ny times writers they're publishers wouldn't print . so guess who ? if you doubt me , look up 25 most censored stories 2004 2005	1
one american evangelicalism sympathetic critics once asked whether there such thing christian mind . all sorts reasons - some more than justified - questioners , skeptics , malnourished pilgrims produced negative responses query . but perhaps things better than all . if encouragement ma taken books culture : christian review , there hope kind wide-ranging integration faith intellect so routinely dismissed implausible cynical , misinformed those who yet discover intellectual renaissance among evangelicals populated university departments ( philosophy physics spring mind parade examples ) proponents robust biblical faith . publication christianity today empire , books culture provides forum some most incisive writing cutting-edge thinking found among christians anywhere . one not talking puff pieces cotton-candy testimony . rather , kind thoughtful self-critical engagement great conversation myriad contemporary issues one expects fat intellectual monthlies reviews new york london times offer here , abundance . this reviewer - who fights his wife possession issue sometimes finds them tucked away bedroom squirrel-holes which she believes him ignorant - watched this young-ish paper emerge something renegade among evangelical organs find its voice stride within just few years . its trajectory not far astonishing . christian century once known thought this quality still hits occasional home run . if it cans sustain its current run , books culture , looks rather . 325 hitter which franchise glory made	1
esquire may man magazine , but i enjoy articles woman , because it no holes barred feedback rough edges included . i got my first issue couple weeks back , found it funny , informative , great pic tom petty , i'm looking forward more issues	1
this original . if you looking man magazine insightful , thought provoking , entertaining , great buy , look no further . esquire around long time one reasons its great success it certain ' feel ' it transcends time . yet it right cutting edge today issues . magazines like maxim , stuff , fhm never class esquire because their appeal strictly ' shock-value . ' basically if you seen one them , you've seen them all . they offer nothing new , most content pretty crass . esquire , other hand entertains while making you think wide range issues . there always something esquire makes you want pick it up actually read what covers . yet it still its own unique style . subscription price huge bargain . you can't go wrong it	1

american photo much better magazine than its sibling popular photography , but frankly , not saying much . it seems though its primary market fashion/glamour photographers since most its issues devoted these aspects professional photography . there other magazines which excel nature photography , so i am not disappointed its absence here , but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy major omission which i hope this magazine address eventually . there also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written working professionals , opposed solely in-house technical equipment overviews . american photo without question among better photo magazines currently available , but unless you interested mainly fashion glamour photography , you might wish look more closely shutterbug or other magazines devote nature fine art photography	1

health magazine publication gears its articles toward wide array health- related issues concerns . when i came across copy first time , i picked it up read degree skepticism . i thought it would magazine exclusively nutrition , but turned out not case . this magazine spend some time talking healthy eating habits , but this only tip iceberg when it comes this magazine . editors this publication talk all sorts health topics , like mental health , relationships , parenting , physical fitness , etc . because this , health something appeal almost anyone who reads it . this magazine divided into five main areas : beauty , body , fitness , mind , food . my personal favorites mind food sections . i like mind area best because it one where i usually find articles most relevant my own health concerns . here , you learn useful things like how reduce stress your work life , how deal problem children , other informative topics . lesser extent , i also like food section because it includes some very interesting recipes show how you spice up ordinary , routine meals little cost minimal effort . if there one thing criticize this publication , it would fact it primarily geared toward women . beauty section , example , focused almost entirely feminine concerns , advice makeup , eliminating wrinkles , etc . some these articles could , course , applied toward men but they mostly centered woman models used photos throughout most sections magazine female . flip side , however , my criticism prove asset women , many whom find this magazine very useful . still , spite this small criticism , health still very good magazine all read . remember- this not just nutrition magazine . importance vitamins , minerals , fats , proteins , carbs comprises only small part publication . remaining sections magazine feature some very useful articles mental health , relationships , disease control prevention , healthy cooking , etc ., making health good publication articles columns anyone relate .	1

i'm liberal , i've devoted reader tnr since 1950s . yes it liberal magazine . it excellent investigative work . i not noticed much change its politics past 50 years . some other readers mentioned tnr stand israel . this stand there since martin peretz took over magazine 1974 . peretz never supported right wing israel , but he certainly supported israel right exist . i remember one his early exposes time magazine its very one-sided reporting israel . this respect , tnr very different nation . but tnr support democratic candidates ? usually , but not exclusively . tnr not like dick nixon , course . after peretz took over , tnr supported carter president 1976 . next , i think it backed john anderson . carter foreign policy obviously started annoy tnr . tnr always backed clinton , gore , kerry . it backed kerry even though it little suspicious his attitudes israel . war iraq , tnr initially took colin powell his word weapons mass destruction reluctantly backed war this reason , after which it felt cheated . if you want left wing antizionist magazine , you won't want even read this . you'll want nation . if you want neoconservative magazine , you'll want read this , but magazine you'll really want weekly standard , or maybe commentary . anyway , i always read tnr , i highly recommend it everyone	1

after getting sample copy ( no , not because my illustrious career amazon reviewer -- if ) , i plans subscribe year or three . articles relevant , meaningful well-written , what more one ask ? i sometimes wonder if subscribed two science magazines overkill , but nah ... what all new discoveries shaping our world , it good idea keep abreast every little thing happening vulcan lab . scientific american more , well , scientific than discovery which tends more towards popular subjects such darwinism , under attack minority u.s. political sphere , but largely unquestioned scientific community . while i support discovery positions , they preaching choir far i am concerned , i not need persuading relevancy , veracity applicability darwin theories theories scientists who built even larger more fascinating structures based upon darwin . so if you're looking science lite , go discover , but if you're serious amateur scientist who already knows all basics , go scientific american , or if you're like me just can't get enough , go both , because both really good	1

although i'm casey democrat , meaning social conservative fiscal progressive , i enjoy weekly standard probably best neo-conservative magazine market . i find it timely , informative , provocative in-depth terms its coverage issues . i particularly like their " week review " feature , whereby they review events week provide some pointed commentary . but where i particularly came appreciate weekly standard debate over moral issues -- they offered innovative clear arguments favor traditional family values , using solid research up-to-date statistics numerous different disciplines , while avoiding usual worn rhetoric family values crowd ( among which i include myself casey democrat . )	1

when weird tales revived around 1988 , i sorely disappointed direction editorial staff taken . it too " progressive " not enough like old wt so many us afficionados knew loved . lin carter great thing going four paperback issues he came out under zebra imprint early 1980 . unfortunately , he not allowed continue . his idea keep flavor old weird tales alive , he it very well . then several years later comes schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt , my goodness it sad see aura gone . gradually , though , wt seemed come put itself somewhat more direction " old-fashioned " ' zine it its heyday ( 1920's-1930 ) , although editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree this observation . anyway , wt sports great covers now , good stories , good book reviews , interesting editorials . i must say i miss s.t. joshi always very entertaining book reviews , but we can't everything . scott connors ' forthcoming reviews surely entertain , douglas winter . all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine support cause fantastic literature , especially dark fantastic ; there so few outlets this kind now whispers weirdbook , not mention long gone forgotten fantasy , no longer published . good job , mr. schweitzer , whether you realize it or not , your magazine become more cozy , old-style , aesthetically pleasing magazine , more true tradition original weird tales , thanks no small part wonderful covers graced it last 13 or 14 years	1

this probably best magazine i subscribe . over past 5 years i've noticed quality my other subscribed videogame magazines deteriorated dramatically . but this one stays true . i thought now one would see drop quality , but quality writing just keeps getting stronger stronger . demo disc , example , continues stay chock demos most current even retro games . quality on-line reviews continues get better ! i love cd rom video tips , even enjoy just watching videos new upcoming games . other magazines , especially ones like gamepro , act like they give you demos , but this only magazine demo disc each ad every month . i even seen these demos sale auctions sites on-line ( including big one starts ) . i'm one those gamers rarely pays full price videogames , i appreciate able play demo some them , until i feel like paying them . amazon great site get used videogames cheap , i appreciate reviews helping me make decision buy game . hope this review helps somebody . mc white said : check it out !!	1
before buying subscription this magazine i would suggest reading through issue first , just so you aware what you'll getting . no , it not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking , articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy . but .. articles make subject accessible average reader , include insights into human behaviors relationships fun interesting . i am always engaged reading articles , find them topical very current , unlike some psychology magazines which too `deep ' drenched older principles . this very `hip ' psychology magazine would appreciated those who not necessarily scholars subject but who genuine interest learning more . my favorite part looking through recommended books section , because there usually something worthwhile read	1
very much lives up it name focusing pastalso present . free offer disc makes this cool . magazine some really good interviews well	1

i've subscribed bar least 6 years now , i enjoy mix articles holy land archeology related topics . current events reported informative useful . book reviews helpful guiding further reading field . i recommend it highly . my only complaint content would editor tends focus controversies press field perhaps merit less attention than he gives it . course , it seems self-serving his part keep beating drums , but it never dull . probably sells few extra copies evry month well . little background myself : ba degree anthropology , ordained elder presbyterian church , usa . i worked public school 20 years now .	1
i discovered this " magazine " while employed reference instructional librarian culinary college . four annual hardcover issues arrive just one ad - back cover . recipe quantities typically family size rather than mass serving quantities . this important note because this magazine very much oriented towards professional or very advanced amateur chef . profiles articles tend focus needs professional . one patron ( local sous chef who graduated different culinary school some years earlier ) began swearing blue streak after thumbing through few issues . when i confronted him outburst , he apologized explained his behavior . three years , he worked under local chef amazed creativity chef coming up new recipes restaurant . after thumbing through issues , my patron realized ugly truth - their entire menu cribbed art culinaire . when i told him i my disposal large stack subscription forms , he immediately took one saying , " next time , i'll ahead him . " each issue large enough beautiful enough double coffee table book ( paper quality pictures easily superior most cookbooks ) , but you want keep every sauce-splattered issue close stove you burning pages . there no other magazine compare it very few cookbooks match it	1

i rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what i read other reviewers , most whom focused how ritzy lifestyles parents depicted articles , how " expensive " clothes , how pretty moms ( models ) , etc ... this magazine . don't we expect some kind facade ? other " parenting " magazines may appear more " real " parents , but this no more than their chosen tactic . any publication whose foundational goal sell more advertising , they wouldn't doing this unless they believed it going work . they selling certain " lifestyle " just like child magazine . if it more accordance yours , fine . but why trash just because it different ? child magazine isn't perfect . but least it doesn't pander . anyone really want see what target latest attempt toddler fashion when they open magazine ? i'd rather just check myself next time i'm out buying diapers . if you value solid writing above all else magazine , then child magazine you .

we subscription 2001-2004 . last year subscription , magazine came focus more more politics , most political articles written conservative perspective or assuming neoconservative world view background . letters disagreeing anything robert kaplan wrote rarely , if ever , printed . ( though i know fact they received them ! ) we dropped our subscription picked up new yorker instead . conservatives however may want take new look this magazine . reviews suggesting it liberal must based pre-2003 reading . occasional issues we bought since dropping our subscription confirm conservative slant persisting . quality writing still reasonable however , it explores issues depth ( albeit one side )	1

this monthly magazine opinionated breath fresh air . it philosophically allied libertarianism , but it not extreme or strident . reason more mainstream moderate than left or right ; it really political common sense . i don't always agree articles , but i rarely object reasoning supports them . point view isn't beholden agendas or special interests , read reason .	1
reason cannot labeled conservative or leftist . nor it extremist libertarian magazine like liberty , fawning over ayn rand . it bases its commentary assumption , if we some faith , our chaotic culture lead somewhere good . but if we try monitor control it excessively , we dampen human creativity end up muddled conflicted . reason takes all aspects culture assumes international perspective . its arguments laid out carefully but contain percolating sense indignation our increasingly repressive environment . same time , they more informative than polemical ; each report grounded specifics - quotes , anecdotes , studies . this most intelligent inquiring " political " journal available . if only it came out more often	1
i love this magazine , images crisp , writing consistantly quality photography always fabulous . let face it when magazine coins phrase , you know it good . i read gq several years found it consistantly good , though i must confess only part i consider must read every month style guy , i don't always agree him , but i love questions , you really wonder if these people ever picked up magazine writing .. one never knows . clothes they feature usually top shelf , uh top shelf prices well .. i mean $2000 pair alligator lofers .. you gotta love it . if you any interest latest styles some great writing well , then i highly recommend this book you , though frankly i can't imagine anyone reading this not already opinion this iconic magazine .. but if you don't then all means pick it up form your own opinion .. it worth effort	1
finally magazine knows cottage . cottage isn't country , although it some those elements . it isn't necessarily small , but it . it doesn't necessarily mean old , though it . country modern hip or antique traditional . above all , it casual comfortable . it place you want come home . it feel , ambiance , flair putting things together don't come room-to-go packages furniture store decorators . i especially like various styles presented each issue -- ultra modern , traditional , log cabin , seaside , california contemporary , etc . monthly comparison styles one furniture grouping . it allows you grab ideas entire spectrum cottage style mix match yourself . i also like how easy how-to advice follow . paint advice luscious gardens interesting food , this magazine it all . accompanying website great . products paints easy find . i've banished all other decorating magazines my subscription list	1

far writing concerned this top notch rock magazine . format appealing pages not marred one too many ads . plus cd comes each issue ; this might help justify cost . original cd priceless real gems average music listener may not heard . they choose theme run it , creating eclectic mix artists illustrate their theme . take example few months back when it legendary tracks studio one jaimaca where it featured little known artists among reggae afficionados like ernest ranglin , michigan smiley next giants like bob marley , skatalites complete view important record label reggae . i really enjoy monthly features including tributes those passed away month entitled " real gone . " old rock stars going faster than they seventies ! other good features brief reviews music indexed filter reissues , reissues extra , tracks , buried treasure just plain filter albums(current stuff ) . depth articles cover subject very entertaining what actually drew me mojo intially information . there one draw back us subsrcibers , it long way acros pond problems occurr . last year my problems follows : receiving my issues two weeks after stores copies , missing cd . their credit both problems solved spite send three issues so i would finally get my ripped off cd , it stole twice ! subscriber beware . sending it clear plastic words cd inside just invitation thief . otherwise it maybe best rock music magazine out there i defintely recommend brits perspective	1
my head pulsates useless music trivia knowledge , most it reading magazines like " mojo . " let face it - brits market cornered quality music-centric publications right now this one , " classic rock , " " , " , occasionally , " uncut , " - but " mojo " editors need get over their obsessive compulsive infatuation beatles bob dylan , both whom influence importance grand scheme rock roll lore grossly overrated . live it ( let hate mail start rolling) ! minor caveat out way , " mojo " writing essence drive , simplicity , reverence its subject matter ( two words - ben edmonds ) , no small feat . their feature articles loaded facts information even i've never read before layout spot-on brilliant . how this innovation ? reviews section skimps neither quantity nor quality . while i can't pretend automatically snap up each issue " mojo " like i " classic rock , " i'm usually latest issue my newstand like dirt dog , evidenced stack back issues casa paull which now towers above all three my kids . if all this isn't enough , most issues come free sampler cd tunes least marginally related cover story - that called " gravy . " oh yeah , i almost forgot . it not half-full ads , like " rolling stone . " highly recommended .	1

health magazine publication gears its articles toward wide array health- related issues concerns . when i came across copy first time , i picked it up read degree skepticism . i thought it would magazine exclusively nutrition , but turned out not case . this magazine spend some time talking healthy eating habits , but this only tip iceberg when it comes this magazine . editors this publication talk all sorts health topics , like mental health , relationships , parenting , physical fitness , etc . because this , health something appeal almost anyone who reads it . this magazine divided into five main areas : beauty , body , fitness , mind , food . my personal favorites mind food sections . i like mind area best because it one where i usually find articles most relevant my own health concerns . here , you learn useful things like how reduce stress your work life , how deal problem children , other informative topics . lesser extent , i also like food section because it includes some very interesting recipes show how you spice up ordinary , routine meals little cost minimal effort . if there one thing criticize this publication , it would fact it primarily geared toward women . beauty section , example , focused almost entirely feminine concerns , advice makeup , eliminating wrinkles , etc . some these articles could , course , applied toward men but they mostly centered woman models used photos throughout most sections magazine female . flip side , however , my criticism prove asset women , many whom find this magazine very useful . still , spite this small criticism , health still very good magazine all read . remember- this not just nutrition magazine . importance vitamins , minerals , fats , proteins , carbs comprises only small part publication . remaining sections magazine feature some very useful articles mental health , relationships , disease control prevention , healthy cooking , etc ., making health good publication articles columns anyone relate .	1
there seems great deal psuedo business magazines . i like business week hard hitting , features excellent articles . i always several articles week this publication worth my time read . many publications dummy down business make it too simple leaving out important details , nuiances important , just assume reader isn't intelligent . articles written concise , generally filled data support their conclusions . i found this magazine invaluable business school because it kept me up date , often ahead my classmates . business world i find this magazine one few keep me informed well rounded aspects business i am not familiar . i really feel this worthwhile publication if you looking stay top what current important business world .	1
i loyal reader many years , i've always very impressed their insightful , deep investigations into various scandals national political events . they _always_ knew more than newspapers . they've just excellent , very well-written , i always felt like they could back up their opinions their open earnest political biases right 6th level abstraction , so speak . their pursuit objective truth , whether their target bush or dnc , earned my respect . new republic kept investigating muckracking while over last decade major news institutions one one become purveyors infotainment pre-digested pablum . my sense media consolidation various new press liability laws , news sources become air-tight we've getting our news company pr flacks lobbyist firms agendas . this environment real investigative work becomes like gold . middle-brow types read time , but writers time others who want real knowledge context what happening ground all read new republic . magazine vastly more influential than it 100k+ circulation # would imply . but .. new republic _for_ war iraq , despite their natural antipathy towards bush , which i share . i haven't read them lately - i'm sure they're appalled how things gone over there . magazine never cluster soft peaceniks usually associated left , but here i feel like they've let loose their inner hawks given bush benefit doubt ( always _wrong_ decision ) .. so what make them .. quasi-neocons ? utopians ? dupes ? they're often much too closely focused israel , this also may clouded their thinking .. colin powell great song-and-dance u.n. last year . i felt i needed try something new . lately i've reading new yorker reason ( it right-of-center doppelganger ) some other magazines , but i still think new republic excellent source news very worthwhile . definately - you should buy issue news stand try it out	1

no other magazine i'm aware gets more undeserved criticism than rollingstone . writing supurb . i don't know why everyone assumes pop culture magazines must all sensationalist rags same vein teen beat . complaining too many talentless teen icons put cover pointless -- it after all magazine delves into pop culture . not liking subject matter isn't just cause criticize . record review section best any music mag . it 100% idiotic assume their reviews bogus just because some band or group you wouldn't ever consider listening anyway got " good " rating . beauty their reviews they pander neither music elitists nor so-called " teeny-boppers , " their reviewers smart enough able differentiate what makes good pop music what makes good experimental music . rollingstone not specialty magazine that going say certain type music great type crap . it just music pop culture mag , damn good one	1

i live internationally reading economist every week since 1997 asian crisis it probably my most productive habit . i read it pretty much cover cover most weeks takes good 2-3 hours . i massacre it during week , roll it up , squeeze it into my handbag rip pages out take me any place i am potentially going bored . reading economist makes you smarter . i am not kidding or craven . it it : - improving your reading skills , reading makes you smarter . it uses language really well . it makes it easier you read harder things quicker comprehension . - affecting your writing style - you find their writing style stays your head affects way you write . - it introduces you wonderful books encourages reading through their references opinions - you eventually get around thinking ' i should really check book out see what fuss ' . discussions reviews economist got me reading adam smith , charles darwin proust among wide range others . you learn books like these learning makes you smarter . it puts daily news you get into context . i remember feeling total frustration during bosnian war . i saw news everyday - but i never understood overall story - what behind it ? you heard it historical " there always trouble balkans " like enough explaination kind horror . now , after almost 10 years reading economist , when i watch news i am more aware context - background story how these events might fit . it enjoyable read - absorbing occasionally very funny . there few things more geeky than bursting out laughing while reading economist - but unexpected laughter good thing ! christmas issue lots additional quirky articles - e.g. barbie torture small boys ( my brother ! ) . economist liberal proper sense it supports rights responsibilities individual , small government/low taxes , pragmatism . so you find it supports ; - legal safe contraception abortion . i am currently pregnant very aware given how hard it , it volunteers . - ending prohibition drugs consistent personal freedom , deal health issues , reduce source funding crime terrorism . - letting people own choice not choice majority , determine who they marry . - free trade most effective method poverty reduction world ever access . economist people who craving reality . it grownups .	1
i could not carry life i know it without economist . no hype . it good . this american reviewer became hopelessly addicted economist news analysis during four years england . magazine - or ' newspaper ' , it stubbornly insists calling itself - published london , though 2005 largest national readership united states . editorial line libertarian more moderate european sense word . essential values individual liberty , modest state , free market economics . don't let name fool you . this weekly far more than economist rag . its anonymous writing current events if fabulous , not mention top-ranked analysis letters , arts , like . let me give you concrete example how economist excels . years , i paid close attention its coverage latino immigration issues usa . one might suppose british magazine would disadvantage when exploring this complex topic , yet economist coverage routinely surpasses us newspapers magazines , perhaps largely because its disdain self-suppressing ' pc ' tactics . only area which i detect broad deficiency this magazine coverage role religion , particularly america . secularist european spectacles its editors wear seem make it impossible them canvass this phenomenon view religion continued fervor advanced western nations something other than retrograde slightly amusing . i tell my university-age nephews - thankfully , they ask - anchor their news consumption one weekly , then read widely beyond it . economist very best anchor available english-reading sailors	1

i subscribed details because i'm interested male psyche . i also like looking male celebrity pictures guy models ads . its not most politically correct article planet , one last page called " gay or ...? " which writer tries uncover if certain type person gay or not , no conclusion actually ever given so i suppose its reader decide . its very stereotypical part magazine , but beyond there cool articles read male perspectives . i also enjoy reading celebrity interviews , addition they include interviews female celebrities . i don't agree everything printed here , but certain articles made me think i've actually gotten lot out it . it helps me understand guys i agree certain opinions . mag leans toward liberal unabashed its attitude so . i like it lot , it may not everyone that fine .	1
man this it , great mag cool business people . what you not know , you after reading all this great info . read !!	1
although stories interviews strand well worth reading , i think it worth saying there not many stories per issue , , least case john mortimer rumpole stories , they taken forthcoming books . said , strand worth four stars i've given it , but i would describe it quot ; coffee-tablequot ; magazine , if such category exists , due its glossy pages , large size format , relatively low number stories interviews content	1
this first time i subscribed this magazine . i really like article topics but wish there more data included back articles .	1
this best magazine i've read lately . it still new , i've only received 4 issues , but read each cover cover , finding each article fascinating , very accessible ( unlike parent publication , which occasionally over my head . ) it may just because i like subject matter - but it seems me these subjects which would interest most people . some recent articles ( oct . 2005 ) included why we lie , meaning dreams , nature consciousness , what causes creativitity , what deja vu . it one subscription which well worth money . only drawback i've found it quarterly - sometimes it seems like long wait issues	1

where else you get magazine talks whatever it wants ? perspectives guys obsessed computers , technology , electronics , you get find out news just anything remotely relating these topics . political , scientific , hollywood , businesses , technology , i love it . i get read topics covered mainstream news sources , next page , what new japanese schoolgirls . i get such kick out it . i also love pseudo-geek talk they caricature . it kind stupid reviews all " wired " or " tired " but funny stupid way . buried enjoyable trash this magazine course , all many articles new electronics i love keep up . like popular science , only not lame . well , i like popsci , so i shouldn't make fun them .	1
i subscriber years grudgingly paid more more every year my subscription . still i always loved pw look forward my weekly edition ... although i not always receive my magazine timely manner . whether because i live west coast or if it just mail , i don't know . sometimes it arrives way into following week , sometimes closer beginning week . i still find magazine valuable , but say following : magazine directed publishing trade i find it ludicrous there so many typos reviews well text . who doing proof reading here ? there new format updated look , but i miss best seller lists back magazine . now they're somewhat middle one definitely can't just easily flip them . also , qa authors so stupidly placed issues which don't contain review author book who interviewed . instead , there reference date issue said book reviewed . it frustrating read qa then not able see review author book same issue . i guess publisher thinks people keep magazine least 4 weeks or issues just lie around house or office pile up . i like " deals " columm " hollywood reader " column , but my very favorite section author profile . i am curious tho age some writers this publication ... i'd also like know how magazine editors decide what book should get starred review . sometimes i'm astounded what gets starred . website , which you get full access when you register subscriber magazine , easy use . even before i receive my issue mail , i see latest issue line	1
fitness magazine ? uh , no i don't think so ... you get very good look their bodies though . i shocked see my local supermarket carrying this . it racy magazine without crossing " naked " barrier ( it puts fhm , maxim , et al shame , not just terms bare flesh - photography + writing better , too ) . conclusion , i say i wish this existed when i teenager - i wouldn't ride my bike miles across moors buy penthouse indians ( who couldn't tell how old i )	1

after getting sample copy ( no , not because my illustrious career amazon reviewer -- if ) , i plans subscribe year or three . articles relevant , meaningful well-written , what more one ask ? i sometimes wonder if subscribed two science magazines overkill , but nah ... what all new discoveries shaping our world , it good idea keep abreast every little thing happening vulcan lab . scientific american more , well , scientific than discovery which tends more towards popular subjects such darwinism , under attack minority u.s. political sphere , but largely unquestioned scientific community . while i support discovery positions , they preaching choir far i am concerned , i not need persuading relevancy , veracity applicability darwin theories theories scientists who built even larger more fascinating structures based upon darwin . so if you're looking science lite , go discover , but if you're serious amateur scientist who already knows all basics , go scientific american , or if you're like me just can't get enough , go both , because both really good	1
summary , this magazine portrays houses you can't possibly ever hope own " airbrushed " presentation can't possibly match real life ; it " house pornography " . it exciting read puts plenty ideas into your head . you determine whether repeated exposure this type media enhance your life or make you miserable . hey , if you spare million dollars need someone tell you what fashionable or good taste -- this you ! people complain ads -- i complain articles . people get way . i note none owners these showpiece homes children -- most living alternative lifestyles . actually , house becomes product relationship instead children . it fascinating cultural phenomenon this magazine leading journal movement .	1
people weekly american magazine celebrity human interest stories , magazine runs roughly mix celebrity human interest stories , people perhaps best known its yearly special issues naming " 50 most beautiful people " , " best worst dressed " , " sexiest man alive " . i think people magazine wonderful magazine because i keep touch what happy actors actress . what good movies good me watch . i think ya'll good job magazine . it worth reading every time i get it . people also includes reviews new books , cds movies .	1
i've reading glamour past three years it great magazine all around . glamour covers topics health , career , finances , sex , relationships , style , etc . all magazines newsstands , this one most intelligent savvy women their 20s 30s . yes there too many ads like most magazines , but that how media survives , they get their salary mostly ads . i usually don't mind because i feel its such great magazine , ads worth putting up . i felt times cosmopolitan little too focused sex " please your man " articles . glamour seems found nice balance i don't feel it dumbs down my intelligence all . i wish they would expand beyond typical articles . i wish they would include more sections culture , travel , technology . men magazines include articles gadgets tech , woman i enjoy gadgets well . its not just guy thing . its not perfect magazine , some issues better than others , but i feel this time glamour best magazine women right now .	1
after i bought glamour off news stand , i read it completely loved it . previous reviews little bit out date here amazon , my opinion , magazine transform dramatically year , if not less . there definitely lot less fluff lot wonderful articles 2005 . example , there articles emotional hardships mom whose kid mentally ill story up coming star happily adopted child . there articles women who struggled so girls today play little league , women get credit cards keep their job when they get pregnant . there lot important powerful article women rights dose celebrity life . my favorite article aisha tyler showing us how much digital touchup cover models .... it definitely made me feel lot better my body . i felt like glamour enough dosage fashion , health news , beauty tips , celebrity life , but still great job remind us greatness woman . i gave it 4 stars due fact i flip through 6 pages ads before i got table contents . i suppose that how magazines make their money , but i without . other than , great mag ! if every issues like one i read , i'd subscribe it heart beat .	1

i got subscription this magazine gift first glance , thought it going nothing but lightweight glossy fluff mainly meant push new products . fair , there plenty lightweight reviews new products each issue , but there also surprising number very useful , practical how-to articles -- mainly geared novice or intermediate digital photographers ( like me ! ) . yes , i've purchased big thick books photoshop before , but somehow , i never gotten far actually reading those books ( maybe too much info hobbiest who doesn't need/won't use 1/2 features product ? ) . i recently switched using photoshop using photoshop elements , this magazine seems nice compliment software package . recent issues , i've learned when how effectively use raw vs jpg , how take better advantage graduated nd filters , how use levels correctly , etc . contributing editors all top-rate photographs examples . i highly recommend anyone new digital slr and/or new pc image software such ps elements , get this magazine . it well worth subscription	1

i read this magazine off several years wanted add my 2 cents . yes , magazine many ads business opportunities . but this exactly something i want read evaluate , marketplace business opportunities . many these franchise opportunities , which exactly where first time entrepreneur should start . articles generally well written many obviously useful , but not all . value each article often depends where you business creation process . it not until i read e-myth revisited i understood value these franchises . this magazine slices dices franchises many metrics help you find one where you most likely both succeed happy . magazine easily worth more than price any person seriously starting or building small enterprise . hope this helpful entrepreneurs out there	1

i chose subscribe this mag over men health . my reasons simple- though both offer same interesting articles interest men , best life less " racy/edgy " content 30 something father 4 may not comfortable reading or leaving around house curious eyes see . it seemed geared more toward my demographic , opposed mens health seemed more geared single bachelor living " la vida loca " . one thing i prefered mens health plethora health/nutrition info each issue . this one area they excel providing wealth nutrition info many recipes complement healthy lifestyle . best life also nutrition info but nowhere near much . my decision based couple issues evaluation . hoping they stand up months come .	1

several times past i've almost completely given up motor trend . i even canceled my subscription two occasions . my main gripe during those times ? too darned many trucks suvs . sure , that what u.s. public seems want , " trend " appear name , but boooooring . when they released truck trend sister publication , i danced joy then fell flat my face when mt seemed still spend 2/3 every issue hulking boringmobiles . recent months motor trend come full circle again seems focusing interesting articles cars . trucks suvs hardly missing , but respect others mt tremendously better than it , say , two years ago . transformation nearly astounding . i still remember first time i closed back flap latest issue suddenly thought " holy smokes , good ! " now definitely worth reading again	1

i take several different magazines , different types . this one i invariably read cover cover , every single issue . ok , so you _interested_ specialized subject matter , first . but if you any interest all aviation history , this magazine presents seldom-failing insight into lost , little-known , obscure aspects entire century aviation . writing literate interesting , they come up some marvellous , mostly unpublished , pictures . i would recommend least trial subscription - my bet you'll like it	1
guy loves outdoors all wonders it provides , " outside " magazine him . filled straightforward info travel , workout health tips , those little gadgets make outdoor activities easier tackle , this publication hits nail head . i would've never discovered it if it hadn't offered one perks renewing my subscription magazine readers ' service , , i am grateful	1
magazine really great . before i started reading flaunt i read surface * wallpaper . flaunt more pop culture articles i find more interesting than those other magazines which seem like they just made rich people . good thing they avoid too many articles europe quot ; spring break-likequot ; travel articles which reused other magazines over-and-over . good magazine read architectual record . quot ; onequot ; really good magazine like flaunt , i don't even know if its still published anymore	1
i've looking good outdoor magazine some time . most focus hunting or fishing , while there nothing wrong , i just don't those things very much anymore . some , like outside , become political rags written people who know virtually nothing outdoors . backpacker , however , focuses hiking camping like it should . skills survival issues priceless . sometimes they go overboard gear reviews , but many also valuable , better than one i read adventure magazine ( if you spending hundreds dollars jeans hiking , something wrong you ) . there many good articles people places hiking camping world . great resource hikers , geocachers , campers climbers .	1
backpacker rare thing periodical market : magazine never weak issue . i subscribed backpacker year now . it only gotten better time -- truly going strength strength . if you love outdoors , this magazine you . your level experience things like hiking , camping , rock-climbing , snowshoeing , canoeing , kayaking , yes -- backpacking , not issue . this magazine consistently something people all levels . my debt these pages great indeed : i learned some skills honed others . i discovered ( visited ) some places i not know existed . it backpacker i tipped off beans roosevelt lodge ( this alone worth price subscription ) . i love : reader choice awards , gear guide issue , work-out plan last year spring hiking issue , stories/feautures . i didn't think they made magazines like this anymore . i wrong . backpacker excellent publication . i give it my highest recommendation . get copy today .	1
it cool but kind short . it should longer	1
i really want like this magazine . one , cover almost so pretty comforting , plus they cover many aspects may concern vegetarian lifestyle , such environment , health , politics , etc . however , recipes inconsistent . some , like readers ' best , excellent . many their other recipes fall short though , some glaring oversight ( example , forgetting salt ) . also , their ' ethnic ' recipes usually aren't great . their preoccupation lowfat recipe also unfortunately lead sacrific taste . seriously anyone think pam healthier than olive oil ?? vt really best when it focuses american classics vegetarian . things like chilis , pot pies , casseroles . i still give this 4 stars because i think except recipes , magazine isn't all bad , plus there aren't many other competitors this market . their cs very friendly when i called . if you aren't picky i am getting exact recipes right , then this nice magazine . me , once my subscription stops , i'm switching buying time-tested recipes books instead .	1
i think popstar great magazine teens . it positive ! not like other celebrity teen mags out there . it up-to-date music , movies tv celebrities .	1
popstar ! my favorite magazine long time because every single issue , i end up finding pictures articles every star i am interested , also some newcomers . they always good words pictures lindsay lohan , hilary duff , ashton kutcher , chad michael murray , justin timberlake , raven , jessica simpson , avril lavigne , aaron carter , britney spears , good charlotte , simple plan , adam brody , olsen twins , jesse mccartney , greg raposo , orlando bloom , usher , harry potter cast ... i could go . my room half devoted their cool pinups posters . they good fashion stuff , funny pictures , fun games ... big shout-out my aunt subscribing me four years ago . i just love this magazine . i don't like other celebrity magazines because they're more racy less quot ; stuffquot ; lol . i would say this my #1 favorite magazine . i also like cosmogirl ! i sort like gl . thank you opportunity express myself . if you're reading this , chad , you rock	1
i bought issue check out groceries store . i made five recipes same issue during weekend , i loved everything . yes , there some suggestions use store bought daugh , pudding mix , whip cream , etc . but you easily substitute daugh your own . food tastes great looks fantastic . some tortes sandwiches really innovative . i certainly subscribe it .	1
this fine magazine cross wired , american woodworker , popular mechanics scientific american . each issue features four very detailed diy projects , short descriptions general guides few others . combined diy info , there usual mix opinion articles , political commentary , news summaries , letters , articles crazy diy-folk , etc . four " core " diy projects each issue include step-by-step instructions , full parts lists extensive photos ( or screenshots ) . all parts lists also include sources , which important age where parts department radio shack just isn't what it used . projects featured each issue usually funky , weird , stuff only tiny fraction readers actually build . reviewer said , most projects simply not useful . however , just because projects aren't exactly useful doesn't mean they aren't cool . i ever build timed cat feeder powered castoff vcr recycled hand-crank meat grinder ? no . i think idea recycling motors control circuits such thing neat ? course , any " real " geek would agree . most electronic projects assume basic soldering skills ( introduction soldering available vol 1 ) , most computer projects natrually involve more skill than just booting machine . outside " core " projects each issue , " diy " section features bunch abbreviated project summaries , expectation you scrounge some your own parts , able read schematic diagram . geeky friend could probably help you out those if you over your head . yes , this magazine expensive . $34.95 /yr four issues sounds like lot . however , ads far less intrusive than they would cheaper magazine , articles better written , make it suitable use actual workshop , it printed sturdy bond paper bound cardstock cover . any magazine , some issues some articles better than others , but whole , quality magazine quite high . many said most tutorials magazine found web various forms , scattered . completely true . nevertheless , it convenient information fairly well-tested magazine added advantage paper . summary , if sort topics covered make interest you , i know no other magazine market better	1
i say i bit disappointed first two issues ... entertained , but not enthralled . nevertheless , this mag tons potential . i expect some near-misses when truly creative endeavor steps outside " formula . " happily , they've come into their own issue three ! ( , after they replaced my usps-mangled copy . record , they so quickly ) . this mag produced o'reilly empire geekytechnohack books which well regarded tech trenches . unique exciting concept here harnessing largely computer-based hacking ethos challenging its exclusively " virtual " focus . safety warning : pale , overcaffeinated hackers must use sunscreen when they step outside fresh look non-virtual world ! this not cheapest subscription shelf ( only four issues/yr ) , but these mags stuffed content , keep you busy weeks casual reading . i personally believe quarterly format makes sense . these not kind topics i want see large/slim format " throwaway " package . i expect these magazines stay shelf future reference . end , editors would well create cumulative topic index each issue . ( consumer reports familiar example ) . overall , highly recommended	1
sea health fitness magazines out there , it hard find ones really give interesting motivational information . muscle fitness , musclemag , flex , all good their own reserve , but targeting juiced up group bodybuilders . men health , men fitness like kind bore their long winded articles ( my experience ) lack any real fitness material . fitnessrx men , other hand , gives person into fitness actual fitness info normal guy . i think fitnessrx men fairly new , possibly year or two into publication format may changed since i first viewed it ( unimpressed ) . information good , thends focus practically any area men life health ( although i admit i note some recylcled info most current issue ) . print quality great well , glossy , very detailed well taken photography workout routines . this fitness magazine i've waiting . excellent photography both motivates , demonstrates workout without putting model some rediculously small pair workout trunks ( men workout ) . i suggest guy who subscribes , or purchases male health magazines pick up issue look over home , or least flip-through magazine aisle	1

i just reviewed burda moden , much what i said there applies here too . first off , i'm plus size lady . i sew , i love burda magazines . till recently i annual subscription i need refresh my subscription again . i always but always subscribed both regular magazine ( which plus size section ! ) plus magazine ( which never duplicates what you see regular one ) . if given choice i think i'd take plus magazine if i couldn't afford both . here some helpful tips why you might like subscribe even if you don't sew , how so if you out states area . canadians there burda magazine reseller , it cost 10$ canadian per issue . which much less than normal pattern now . so it saves you patterns . burda ways subscribe each country , just go their website click till you get reseller your own area . why burda best ! fashions presented 2 years ahead . i found styles presented burda year ahead hitting stores retail , 2 3 years ahead other major pattern companies , 1 year ahead burda pattern envelopes sold fabric stores . even if all you look upcoming styles never sew stitch you find this magazine useful keep ahead trend curves . this what european ladies wearing . all clothing well put together , showing current trends ( future trends north america ! ) europe shoes , purses , jewelry , colour choices more . they use fashion forward textiles make garments photos clear enough you get trim detail figure out fabric your local store . if you sew , this magazine keep you wasting money outdated expensive paper patterns keep you front end fashion . after all if you go trouble sewing , fitting it nice if you wear something few extra years look up date while doing so . plus size lady , i found it refreshing surprise find patterns actually looked stylish ahead ready wear regular market let alone nightmare retail plus size ready wear . each magazine comes all patterns make all clothing featured . look thru , see what you like trace off your own pattern . note sizes -- burda fits much closer than normal pattern companies which makes much nicer fit , but you may find yourself needing go up size or two . measure carefully , try cutting one size up till you get used fit . don't cut into expensive fabric till you used how they fit . make few cheaper garments first . armholes crotch area fit differently than north american clothes . aware above size 20/22 north american sizes , won't fit into these plus sizes . their idea plus 14-20/22 . if you bigger it fairly easy size patterns up bit , but you need some experience sewing pattern alterations well . ( learning how , check out sandra betzina stuff altering patterns)here couple helpful hints dealing tracing off patterns centerfold . i used waxed paper usual kitchen type roll traced sharpie marker pen . why wax paper ? it cheap , you see thru it , you fuse it into bigger sheets needed . fusing wax paper : take warm iron , press thru paper towel so you don't get wax paper your iron . ( when you finish , run your iron over clean terry facecloth absorb any wax seeped out ) . when fusing , hold till wax paper clings it look bit " bubbly " . edited add : use highlighter pen mark lines you tracing off . it help you " see " correct pattern peice correct size spaghetti trail master pattern centerfold . tracing : burda patterns don't come seam allowance so i added after tracing my patterns . using sharpie straight edge long runs i traced off my desired size patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over newsprint center . then add seam allowances before cutting out your wax paper pattern ! all those lines . here where my wax paper tip comes handy . i've tried tracing paper , even interfacing but multiple lines burda magazine pattern too much those usual tracing papers or interfacing . you need something much more see thru . wax paper ! cheap , almost transparent , sturdy won't bleed sharpie marker ink . burda doesn't print one sided pattern masters so you trace . you can't just sacrifice rest patterns cut yourself one only since other peices likely printed back . remember add your seam allowance !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! once i cut out my pattern ( write all notes what size , layout , darts etc pattern ) i put my pattern pieces manila envelope . pattern envelopes home made patterns work best some labelling . i put magazine ( fall winter 05 ) page # ( 34 ) model i'm copying size , yardage i require any sewing notions or extras ( zippers , interfacing , 17 buttons , yada yada)maybe due bit obsessive such things i sketch line drawing envelope note saying , skirt , pants , jacket or whatever garment . my drawing isn't perfect but i try include front back view major seams darts drawn . it useful . i keep them normal household file folder , since manila envelopes fit perfectly . file under jacket , dress , skirt etc . or year . there , i hope helps . this well worth getting even if you never sew single stitch magazine .	1

i'm huge military history buff i'm glad see these history magazines popping up next penthouses playboys news stands . essentially , it good magazine , describing vividly often over-looked aspects war shaped us all . i especially like articles like one american canadian 1st division , who landed them juno beach ( yes , juno beach ) . only complaint i it concentrates too much ' american effort ' war . yes , america contribute , but undoubtedly bulk credit must go soviets . they meat grinder swallowed all german elite units 1942-43 so normandy , most amphibious assualt groups making contact 3rd line conscripts slave soldiers . yes , some crack units faught against western allies , good example afrika corps , paratroopers , some ss units , etc , but really , it soviet juggernaut msot prominent . i hate other reviewer said russian soldiers far worse than landers . now , you commiting same sin one you preaching against ! don't generalize millions russian soldiers served died into ' rapists sinners ' category , because some them commit atrocities . also , average russian soldier forced nkvd charge german positions , often without any weapons , gunpoint . retribution later war years inevitable , but course not acceptable . but heroism , stamina , lethality average russian soldier , only ' secret weapon ' army , especially early years , should not overlooked	1
i'm velonews subscriber , happy one . it bit pricey , but worth it . it tough beat race coverage -- these folks cover all significant road racing united states , well cyclocross racing bit mountain bike racing too . this review , i'll put velonews into context review other cycling rags . velonews , writing editing quite good -- articles tight gripping . i find myself tad lost finer details us racing . when they're reporting some cyclocross race new england , example , i don't know single rider . velonews essentially lavishing coverage cycling " minor leagues . " velonews militantly sticks racing -- they don't gush over celebrities . if they gush over anything , it $5000 carbon fiber race bikes most us would never consider buying . velonews written avid bike racing audience , not just people who know what " peloton " . i'd say velonews just bit aloof -- stubbornly addressed hard-core cycling fans amateur racers . it if they won't talk those us shimano 105 our bikes or admit some us like read cycling celebs novice repair tips . velonews most comprehensive source news american racing , bar none . myself , i tend prefer grander competition european racing , where very best compete age-old races . i've come learn us racing , but times i feel bit more drawn cyclesport , which really just looks euro racing . latter mag more celebrity oriented glossy , pretty much ignores us race scene . also , it only comes out monthly , so " news " really old !! velonews comes out bi-weekly , so it really stays current . this major , major difference . bicycling magazine pays almost no attention racing , instead gives recreational rider her due . bicycling you get tips nutrition , training , repairs , commuting . i currently subscribe all three . bicycling magazine must me , because it very well , focuses amateurs , so cheap . racing news , i might end up going cyclesport because my preference euro road racing . i don't any touring , but my friends who just * adore * adventure cyclist , which part great non-profit cycling advocacy organization . sum , velonews you if you're . ) hard-core fan bike racing , particularly road racing ; . ) most interested north american racing ( though they very good coverage giro , tour de france , many other euro races ) . fans sport , velonews good it gets	1

i've various times subscribed stuff , maxim , fhm magazines . stuff only one i ended up not resubscribing . it its moments photography fine . i would describe it maxim younger brother . it whole attitude seems like younger sibling popular kid high school , this kid then tries hip just funny , etc ., but it forced very juvenile . it just snarky predictable after awhile . other hand , i'm not 21 anymore either , maybe if i my 20 i would find this height humor	-1
this magazine recently ( april 05 ) featured what they felt 100 greatest movie moments all time . number 1 sing-along scene magnolia . other moments top 10 included credits austin powers 3 one eugene levy quotes american pie . keep mind , these 100 greatest movie moments all time . this mag/rag nothing more than film section fhm stretched out full-issue length . utter trash	-1
i'd always heard interesting articles this magazine . but mess ads people magazine gossip lands ( big , heavy thud ) my doorstep every month most worthless magazine i've ever made mistake purchasing . it pretentious tripe aimed small group nyc media insiders , self-regarding movie celebs , those people who'd like part world . even when they occasionally hit compelling subject , writers so narcissistic truly repellent . it'd more accurate simply cut " fair " out title	-1
i've people subscriber 2 years now i quite agree majority reviewers ... same celebrities , different week . if it isn't tomkat/kitten , it branjelina or benifer 2 . oh , we cannot forget " mrs. oops , i it again " spears-federline . very little real people/human interest stories anymore , very little ... actual magazine , it seems i've become , through no choice my own , one people quality control employees . after subscribing , i informed customer service my allergy their scented inserts . i told note would made my account i would no longer receive inserts my magazine . here where my job qc employee came , my remove these inserts several times first year , then again second year which i made call customer service . they apologized . stated there note my account regarding my request then they offered extend my subscription two more weeks . next problem part my " new " job requirements ... reassembling my magazine . i received least 4 or 5 issues people put together either backwards , upside down or half magazine front other half flipped over back . order read enjoy these issues , i remove staples , try rearrange pages then line pages up staple holes reinsert staples . again i called customer service complain . again they apologized then offered extend my subscription 2 weeks . i've since written cancel my subscription . i've not heard word back people inc ., regarding this . we'll see how it turns out	-1
i subscribed this magazine year found it waste money . every issue girl bikini front ( can't woman look sexy anything but ? ) every issue claims " best ever exercise .... " ok .. what last 10 issues claimed same thing .. those exercises no longer " best ever ? " i didn't like fashion sections , i also don't like how there really aren't any articles . when i subscribe magazine i'd like able read it , not just look pictures . only thing i liked it success stories .. even those seemed repetitive ... we only allowed fruit grilled chicken ?	-1
my subscription year . but subscription office stopped sending magazines even before subscription expired . i would suggest people subscribe good housekeeping directly instead	-1
this worst magazine i ever subscribed too . i hated it so much after first issue when new ones came , i thru it right trash . here why : 1- ad after ad dietary supplements ( like dexatrim stacker ) which i think cheapins creditablity magazine b/c true health doesnt come bottle . 2- many pics overly built up women ( think fitness competitions ) ... not something average women aspire too ... too me , nasty looking . 3-the information it general information anyone common sense already know ! my advice you , avoid this magazine , unless you like body building or like looking body builders	-1
this kind impulse buy me i didn't get what i thought i would get . i thought it would clear concise magazine what up coming tv movies . instead i got indepth ramblings actors directors . if you want pick up magazine find out what coming up without fluff filler ... this not mag you .	-1

new york magazine articles advertisements too risque , always pushing envelope . thanks , but no thanks	-1
i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
admittedly , i am slightly older than " relevant " demographic . but i'm not 40 yet ! so there number things here some appeal me . i applaud magazine attempting address culturally important issues . still , magazine suffers it unrelenting fawning over whole post-modern vibe it own sense self-importance beacon charismatic hipness . ( " hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks ipods too ! " ) usually , more something or someone sweats proclaim their own relevance , more danger there they become irrelevant . so , like it spiritual cousin " charisma , " this magazine suffers somewhat shallow perspective life culture . it trumpets its ability ask " tough questions , " even it follows relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea cutting edge put bono cover . if you want cutting edge , put libertine adam clayton cover ask him bono faith . now , i would read article ! ( i am major u2 bono fan . i'm not knocking him ; just lack imagination " relevant " . ) there also way too much emulation world perspective generational heritage . " hey , we're young , we're smart , we don't need anything way our geezer parents it . " i guess little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it today paris hilton culture , but i'd like think it might little different culture shaped biblical values . actually , " relevant " seems little afraid say what " biblical values " ( beyond obvious politically expedient ones ); it all seems amorphous here . i've never fan whole " what hot/what not " ethos . , i'd like give little more respect today christian young people think they could handle something didn't fall into same faddish trap . i am hopeful they may get it right yet " relevant " . times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization youth , culture icon quotations , psycobabble " cool dude " theological lingo make one relevant	-1
i agree those who didn't care it . only thing i liked one article written dad who skateboarding his son . it witty , insightful inspirational . rest mag just seemed totally irrelevent my life . it aimed people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . anyone ? i don't want my kids concerned clothes money . few issues i read made me mad depressed . i've never written review before but felt compelled so regarding this lame magazine . give me break $400 cashmere hoodie my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts what matters . he not reflection my style , he reflection his own . get over yourselves	-1
when i first heard there american version l'uomo vouge i really excited . i thought " finally american men fashion magazine that'll edgy , risky , creative original ! " i couldn't more wrong . this magazine virtually indistinguishable lackluster men magazines gq , esquire details . european men fashion magazines works art cutting edge photography , bold reporting beautiful advertising . you won't find any this men vouge . editors this magazine greatly insulted intelligence american readers . if i could i'd give this magazine negative 5	-1
recipes included good , but this not " cooking " magazine . this women fitness magazine disguise . while i am all magazine focuses overall health fitness , it shouldn't advertise itself cooking magazine . there way too much other junk . if i wanted makeover or exercise routine , i don't expect go my cooking magazine get .	-1
this magazine just dares people pick most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . " town country " extremely old money venture , while it some good useful articles ( lovely advertisements things virtually nobody afford , ) much magazine essentially centered very elitist worldview grows very tiresome rather quickly . " town country " initially recommended me because ostensibly good coverage travel architecture , two areas i great interest . applicable aside , when i read list tips offshoot " town country travel " publication ways ease stress long range flights , i realized there reality check due when one first tips always fly first class , ignoring fact vast majority readers would rather buy car what typical first class ticket europe or asia costs . i mentioned , there some good articles , there occasionally better more useful offshoot publications like " town country travel " eminently more readable ( although they still insist advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes coast , etc . ) i say photography always good , you believe if it appears here it finest most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like seen reading this magazine . despite occasionally worthwhile features , i find " town country " excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding publication focused whatever area interest you , whether it fashion , society , or travel .	-1
... because that all this magazine : advertising vehicle aimed kids who aren't old enough discriminate ads actual content yet . don't fooled venerable " national geographic " name : this publications pays only briefest lip service educational content . when my son received it gift i shocked see ads virtually indistiguishable articles . fact , ads often much more visually interesting . photos excellent , i must admit . but layout jazzed up point absurdity , if designed play kids minuscule attention spans . science facts sound , but again , articles cut absurdly short , more like squibs factoids than actual articles , if editors believe kids couldn't possibly focus one topic long enough actually read more than 250 words it ... or maybe because they didn't want distract kids all tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page . editor parent , i am appalled this magazine would not recommend it anyone . national geographic should ashamed itself pushing this kind junk young readers . avoid this publication like plague .	-1
change good ; however , sometimes change very bad . earlier this year pc mag decided become magazine masses instead providing technical information their longtime dedicated readers . before change this magazine i would keep year or so refer back content ; now i skim it 5 minutes don't feel there reason keep it any length time . longtime subscriber ( 20 years ) i not re-subscribing magazine . i wish them luck , but i believe they lost sight their subscription base chasing broader base subscribers might disappoint them	-1
this probably best music/movie magazine out today . however , you go borders books or barnes nobles get it $8.95 or something . this deal bs	-1
" spin " accurate name something like this -- lot hype , innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone dirty old geezer rock magazines , then spin teenager who tries hard convince you he cool name-dropping strokes . spin covers some same turf rolling stone blender , but less lasciviously -- lots coverage popular bands . some them quite good -- hives , example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job " blues clues " after hearing flaming lips album , reinvented his life rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands hot moment , then overemphasize them again -- well tacking them up whatever " coolest " / " best " lists they chalk up year/decade/century/history rock . indie cred maintained few half-page articles potentially hot bands like comas metric , but this info halfhearted . it like they're reluctant tear themselves away articles better-known bands , regardless talent . writing , however , certain affliction lot major rock magazines : need cool . their writers always trying funny , but rarely come across way . it seems silly strained , like soccer mom wearing spandex tube dress . even cd reviews mediocre . however , one recent highlight dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , little bit skewed . fact , they often best things entirety magazine . one problems emphasis stuff hollywood . scarlett johanssen wonderful actress , yes . but she doesn't sing , nor she appeared music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . what up party coverage tv starlet mischa barton mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under radar online kludge in-depth looks some worthy bands . spin ? it still trying convince us it cool , but eggers only regularly cool thing it	-1

this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	1
i once asked regius professor hebrew university cambridge how he stays abreast fast-moving developments biblical archaeology , field investigation related but decidely peripheral his own work . ' i mostly read bar ... ' , he said , unexpectedly low-brow response hallowed halls great university . ' then if i want know more topic , i move more scholarly publications . ' it vote confidence magazine (* not * academic journal ! ) i've read years found equally useful maintaining generalist knowledge area investigation - let address elephant room - most us come out religious interests . bar effectively combines well-edited prose leading scholars due general-interest attention color photos complementary resources like slides ( past era ) phenomenally well-produced videos dvds . issue pulled random my shelves ( november/december 2001 ) contains articles entitled : -excavating philistine gath . we found goliath hometown-the monastery cross . where heaven earth mee t-t he rise fall dead sea-is it or isn't it - synagogue ? addition , usual suspects appear issue issue interesting columns add color commentary polemical field where personalities well artefacts theories loom large . you'll want ignore over-heated reader responses one brand disillusionment or . but you'd wrong heed some reviewers ' critiques political headbashing goes among archaeologists . when elephants this kind collide , it usually over ideological argument matters . it us no good deride such battles mere politics . bar good sense play both spectator provocateur role such infighting over complaints readers who wish things more placid around here . they not . things we continue dig up rocky ground israel , jordan , lebanon , egypt other locations continue insure we never fall prey boring consensus regarding history these great lands faiths they engendered . read bar if this sounds remotely interesting decide yourself	1

i'm liberal , i've devoted reader tnr since 1950s . yes it liberal magazine . it excellent investigative work . i not noticed much change its politics past 50 years . some other readers mentioned tnr stand israel . this stand there since martin peretz took over magazine 1974 . peretz never supported right wing israel , but he certainly supported israel right exist . i remember one his early exposes time magazine its very one-sided reporting israel . this respect , tnr very different nation . but tnr support democratic candidates ? usually , but not exclusively . tnr not like dick nixon , course . after peretz took over , tnr supported carter president 1976 . next , i think it backed john anderson . carter foreign policy obviously started annoy tnr . tnr always backed clinton , gore , kerry . it backed kerry even though it little suspicious his attitudes israel . war iraq , tnr initially took colin powell his word weapons mass destruction reluctantly backed war this reason , after which it felt cheated . if you want left wing antizionist magazine , you won't want even read this . you'll want nation . if you want neoconservative magazine , you'll want read this , but magazine you'll really want weekly standard , or maybe commentary . anyway , i always read tnr , i highly recommend it everyone	1

fine cooking takes somewhat consumer reports-like approach cooking , much manner cook illustrated . but there several key differences set fc apart make it superior ci : 1 . fc , not all voices sound alike . ci , every article , no matter who writes it , sounds though it written same person . i understand why they this ( keeping focus food not personality , maintaining consistency ) , but it gives magazine creepy , musty , claustrophic , stepford wives-like quality . this magnified fact there no " outsiders " allowed into ci kitchen -- no visiting experts , no star chefs , just ci staff their identical voices . 2 . fc there no christopher kimball essays : ci bow-tied editor fills up entire page already thin magazine folksy , prairie home companion-like homily why owning large , upscale farm rural new england makes him morally superior everyone else , replete recurring cast curmudgeonly cranks crackpots -- all which absolutely nothing any food issue , or lives anyone else planet , possible exception martha stewart . it embarrassing , self-indulgent soapbox . but he leader cult , so don't expect his sermons dispappear any time soon . 3 . ci advertises itself " ad-free " -- then proceeds glut its pages print ads blow-in cards touting ci cottage industry recycled books . i'd rather peruse offerings fc advertisers , whose products least potentially useful me . 4 . fc no constantly recycled material . such supposedly modest operation , ci puts out staggering number books , many them single-topic tomes borrow heavily recipes already printed magazine , well other , previously published ci books ( there evil twin " america test kitchen " series books dvds ) . you're likely find same pie crust or tomato sauce recipe 16 different books . incestuous nature this recipe factory casts unflattering mercenary shadow across ci mission . 5 . fc offers superior quality production methods . glossy paper attractive , full-color photos fc put ci faux-downhome matte paper hand-drawn illustrations shame . 6 . fc much more variety . fc also its own group regular contributors , but they supplemented each issue experts variety fields culinary arts ( who write their own unique voice -- imagine ! ) , giving magazine broader scope much fresher feel than ci , which tends stick standard set all-american classics , which they recycle every five years ( how many times you revamp " secrets macaroni cheese " ? ) . give fine cooking look . it hands-down best food magazine home cooks	1

i am big fan british publications such economist financial times because they tend offer more balanced global perspective news . articles here short sweet . why i so suprised how thin newspaper when i got my first delivery . this good thing when you busy , but sometimes i found myself wanting more in-depth coverage . this where wall street journal ( wsj ) tends shine . plus , wsj more articles addressing one lifestyle , i.e , personal journal . also , op-ed pieces undeniably left-leaning but bit more balanced whereas wsj tends pretty conservative one-sided . although i really enjoyed newspaper , i cancelled my subscription because horrible delivery service . one final note , prepared salmon pink color newspaper . i know they want stand apart other publications , but it makes newspaper look like it stuck attic 10 years makes it kind hard read low light settings .	1

avid reader id magazine first , i stunned see magazine like ' wallpaper ' more dedicated actual products than industry . id magazine just always left me wishing 1 ) there more pictures actual products 2 ) i didn't just spend much money each issue . i loved wallpaper . but then i introduced ' surface ' . surface features more design-oriented . you get sense editors hand-picked products their innovation , sculptural form , desire expose readers designs ranging fashion architecture product . it more obvious surface goes great lengths make whole issue cohesive ; general theme carried one article next . other hand , wallpaper -- while very good addition surface -- seems more like monthly " collection " interesting design products buildings sent reporters around globe . wallpaper its own advantages , however , it it always strives get things around world , not just europe or u.s. fact , it features more asian design than surface special issues like wallpaper navigator -- sort guide design-minded world traveler . ( you'd surprised level sophistication current asian design . ) nevertheless , each issue surface simply more special , more professionally executed , while i pick up wallpaper all time , surface magazine i subscribe . end , id magazine like ' guide downtown eating ' professional industrial designers ; wallpaper " buffet " three its product section , architecture section , world section ; surface , fittingly , well designed three-course dinner its appetizer , entree , dessert all complementing each other .	1

friend mine got me subscription this magazine because i like cooks illustrated . this magazine nothing but ads snazzy expensive foods restaurants . there so few recipies it i wouldn't call it ' cooking ' magazine . what few recipies they don't explain why they chose ingredients used or give much detail all . if you consider yourself ' foodie ' who likes go fancy restaurants likes know what hip latest gourmet food wine , then this magazine might you . if , however , you like cook know what you doing why you doing it , try cooks illustrated instead .	-1
child i remember finding this magazine my doctor office reading it because it only thing available . it not changed much . there no redeeming features make up dated patronizing content . this magazine neither stretch your child mind nor keep him entertained . it only teaches child what he already knows feeds him what he already seen . coming era global connection , children must become aware other parts world lifestyles alien them . only telling them what already common their everyday lives helps foster racism xenophobia	-1
i reading this magazine work , i consider it trashy magazine . it only focuses sexual part women , like if sex best thing world , because they this article which girl riding taxi , she thought taxi guy fine , so she unbutton her shirt told taxi guy touch her breasts . then she says it * best experience she ever . i just cant believe they publish garbage like , giving message women its ok undress yourself total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer read things focus more inner heart , emotional , spiritual side things . read books help me better person right now future , throw away garbage this society	-1

i am utterly disappointed direction gamepro taken over past two years . i actually stopped my subscription 1 year , but came back 20 issues $10 their ( 10 ? ) year anniversary . i forget . but magazine really bad . one thing i laugh , retro corner . they info issues 5 10 years before , they always announce number pages 10 years ago . i think most recent issue , they said : 140 pages ? huh ? i think my last issue around 100 . don't try tell me they've lost 40 pages advertising . too bad on-line reviews websites , taking over subscriptions hardcopy magazines . i'll stick hardcopy until end my life . or until quality these types magazines gets so low , i can't stand it anymore . or until my subscription runs out this craptacular effort . you guys pretty good 5 years ago , but you've gone pot these past two years ! i'm talkin ' you watchdawg !!! you guys suckin ' lately !!! mc white said : you guys suckin'!!	-1

i admit , they some good recipes , but most them not simple very time-consuming . there always million ingredients each little recipe . if you stay-at-home housewife absolutely love cook , buy this , but if you just normal , you won't find many recipes here you . i suggest you consider ' cuisine home ' before you buy this one	-1
i would agree previous reviewers , burgeoning ads this magazine over past decade made magazine chore read . number ads now easily exceed number pages devoted articles . it also quite disturbing note many those ads ( possibly 50% or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such viking ranges , bmw , oceanna cruises , trips bora bora ... wtf ? although i enjoy i luxury meal , i don't want go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine selling . ocassionally , behind clutter , i find useful recipe ; i rarely find interesting article . i am going let my subscription expire end current period	-1
articles weren't anything new . mostly fluff cosmetic/clothes ads . better info exercises oxygen women mf .	-1
i reader businessweek over 10 years . i noticed it significant change focus over last year . while there more articles " personal business " , hard-core articles gone way newsweek , u.s. news world reports . nature articles lightweight not reflect issues important decision makers today . like many others , i noticed political slant or agenda over last year . specifically , their commentaries economic analysis trend left . bob kuttner co-editor american prospect contributor boston globe . every one his articles begins premise president policies bad then followed tortuous rational thesis , include discussion days gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson better , but former clinton advisor , not objective her analysis . alternative economic opinions far few what opinions they tout , not agree numbers stated their own figures week . while bw potential great reporting based their resources , they let their editorial priorities get way serious business reporting . serious business readers students , i recommend going alternative sources . yes , i let my subscription lapse this year .	-1
i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything it . i very disappointed . not enough recipes . recipes included not really ones i would use .	-1
i yet see pw review anything not vetted pc police , not mention utterly stupid . when they want pan book , they apparently list criticisms they pick random , such " non sequitur " or " murky argument " or " reductionist " . they pick them throwing darts list writing down whatever phrases darts hit , ways prove they don't actually any understanding what terms mean . it especially annoying because even when it book i like , i easily see criticisms someone different worldview could make would valid , but they don't make them ; would require work . reviews so shoddy wildly inaccurate i thought asking amazon.com stop using them product info pages , but then it occurred me any book pw pans guaranteed good , so they useful backwards way . anytime pw praises book , i don't bother it , but if they attack it , i know it going great	-1
this magazine used very thorough , it used very good providing me tons deals tips i never would found my own . it great , very opinionated . but last year sometime , they changed look it now there lot less text . it much more style magazine now , that not what i want travel magazine i bought tell me money saving ! worse , except 40 best vacation bargains , which still okay , most articles forget incluce lot money-saving tips instead they too often suggest i expensive things . since when $225 night hotel considered budget ?? headlines captions expecially smart-aalecky . it not good expert advice it used ! i noticed arthur frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe why -- bring him back ! my search true money-saving travel magazine unfortunately resumed again	-1

laptop mag best described negatively : it not really serious computer magazine . it more or less like consumer guide , which basically paid advertising . this means you can't really trust article here because you don't know if they not written unbiased writers . end , i feel this waste money . besides , you get all info free web , cnet or zdnet , anyway	-1
i've read many positive reviews this magazine i receive , several months ago , trial issue . after sending subscription fee , i billed again . i wrote note letting them know check endorsed deposited . yesterday , i got notice telling me my subscription expired after one issue . i give up . it might good , but customer service really lousy . what disappointment .	-1

magazine broad range patterns . out 1 year there 10 things i want make . or i should say i wanted make- until i started first one . they high percentage errors patterns . one issue 13 out 30 corrections . worst part , they don't seem post corrections until reader tried knit item told them what wrong . which means unless you want lot counting , calculating , ripping reknitting , you wait until issue out 6 months other readers found errors . i'm working cardigan i plan give someone christmas , found 2 major errors so far . no idea if i get this time when i get if i'll cardigan or layette ! one more error causes me rip it out start over i'll find new pattern or make my own . after spending $130 angora yarn make this gift , i'm not going give up , but renewal notices i get magazine promptly thrown out . update- still working cardigan , pretty much start over redesign pattern my own . still no correction online , but they added many other corrections other patterns this issue . corrections sometimes little , simple ones , but some corrections total rewriting instructions or charts ! i thrown out all magazines so i don't get tempted try pattern them	-1
i cook almost everything scratch , so i figured home cooking would people like me , who make effort make good quality home cooking without silly ingredients you see some those gourmet magazines . instead , recipes consist packaged dough , bottled sauces , etc . i don't need read magazine figure out i put jar spaghetti sauce some pasta add velveeta make casserole !	-1
truth-be-told , i hated " " give this magazine even one star , but least i could via this rating system . this magazine some good writers but needs new editor . mr. shoaf very bad his job , clearly , seems use reuse " buddy system " using writers . perhaps he gets kickback ? any rate , this , overall , cruddy example journalism . my facts tell me it should fall under fiction rather than nonfiction many issues . i am it . get new editor perhaps i reinvestigate publication . until then , so long . i no time absolute rubbish	-1
this just like english version but spanish . content not reflect culture or morals general latino people . nearly all models ( especially cover ) white and/or american very thin tall . they try use photos american celebrities when they brown hair , example christina aguilera , mandy moore , angelina jolie or just natural brunettes like catherine zeta-jones . maybe cosmo thinks we're too ignorant easily fooled dark hair dye job or computer generated tans . there tons beautiful succesful latinas could easily placed covers but i think they'd rather just use same photos they already took their english-version magazines . ads also high-end american european products . i've bought this magazine mexico while it still same problems least they feature real mexicans mexican products some ads . if you want magazine more reflects latino culture , although it mostly english , get latina magazine . they use lots latina models it more relevant latin-american women people interested latino culture	-1

this magazine i frequently get confused foreign affairs magazine . primary difference longer well-written essays leading experts affairs whereas foreign policy more frequently published , more up date more direct version other . it would great both since policy keeps you more current high degree professionalism while other gives you deeper detail . if you don't lot time read , policy one you'll need enjoy .	1

cooking school instructor , i believe there only four pieces reading material home cook needs : quot ; fine cookingquot ; , corriher quot ; cookwisequot ; , quot ; food lover companionquot ; , goldstein quot ; wine lover cookbookquot ; . your magazine it all : excellent cooking tips ; first-rate articles rating various appliances cooking tools ; excellent pictures detailing procedures ; recipes error-free ingredients listed order which they used instructions ( pet peeve mine ! ) . i agree recent review stating level difficulty your recipes encourages stretching one cooking abilities but not poit giving up . past years i really liked you highlighted small grower or breeder back cover -- one goat cheese apples come mind . all editors contributors : keep up wonderful work	1
printed daily newspapers , wsj easily superior just every aspect really matters . nyt lot more better photographs , but they best viewed computer screen . there not much argue ( regarding relatively conservative editorial page ) this review hasn't already written ; one more center-right midwesterner recommendation not going much incremental value . however , investor consumer i state wsj its website primary source credible information businesses , law , finance consumer products . anybody works living , mortgage or long-term savings plan would benefit reading wsj often possible . there simply no substitute	1

this publication , my opinion , most intelligent , funny , readable magazine pc games available . it blows competition offered up u.s. magazines out water . you get : * dual-sided dvd loaded demos , movies , screenshots , podcasts , games , mods , patches , compiled archives games hardware recommendations view your pc*humor which obliterates drivel attempted us version . * lots material- it thick pages much bigger size . you feel like you're getting real magazine rather then flimsy , cheap catalogue advertisements . * quality- both writing physically . there loads articles good insight into industry every month . they given lots space feel very scholarly read . pages good quality paper ink crisp clear , easy read . pick up copy this shop like barnes nobles sometime see what it like . i guarantee you'll impressed , especially if you're used gaming fare we get served this side pond	1

i'm subscriber road track , car driver , motor trend . simply put , rt one i look forward most each month . if you're looking well-rounded auto magazine , this it . rt you'll find : -road tests first drives . -an excellent " ampersand " monthly feature all latest info future cars prototypes . -news latest races drivers . -top-notch photography art . -witty columnists . ( see side glances peter egan)-the occasional technology-related feature . -classic cars , classic drivers , classic tracks . best historical content business . -very little content suvs . ( positive my book)the competitors : car driver substantially more road tests previews , some good specialty features pretty regular basis , but hardly anything racing history . frankly , motor trend isn't anything write home . articles shorter less captivating , they can't seem settle design theme , they also lack racing historical content . if i pick just one , road track would definitely my choice .	1
under radar filter only music magazines i come near . i hear mojo just informative , renovative , enjoyable , but i'm little too close-minded care other genres i ... don't care much . fans rock/pop/what kids calling " indie " /alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/ !!!!, take gander this . covers slick durable . they don't look out place sitting coffee table	1
harper , like atlantic new yorker written those looking more in-depth analysis coverage political cultural affairs sampling serious literary prose . personally i prefer atlantic , which i read regularly , only picking up harper when i time something it interests me , which usually two or three times year . just looking cover pages inside convey harper serious tome , perhaps too serious casual reader , especially compared more colorful pages atlantic playful new yorker cartoons . nevertheless , harper american icon it genre published many articles great names since it inception 1850 . number reviewers complain it left leaning stance clearly sprouts now recently departed editor lewis lapham , who outspoken critic current administration . mr. lapham shares his views two page opinion piece full page listing various " fun facts " known harper index . serious readers able get beyond this simply " viewpoint " see entire magazine serious writing it . i would contend this represents best " critical analysis " rather than bias . i would also simply suggest you view other reviews made people espousing this periodical overly biased . instance , least one those claiming liberal bias here also praising ann coulter book . so if you feel underwhelmed typical content you get even 60 minute broadcast or political round table free-for-all you're interested enough this magazine read it reviews , you should probably pick up copy it two or three months give it try . i recommend you also check out new yorker atlantic compare	1

nyrb atlantic monthly among my favorite subscriptions ; terms sheer intellectual depth range , it very tough beat nyrb . while i not read nyrb cover cover , i end up spending least 5 hrs each issue . main strength this magazine fact typical article written expert deep knowledge subject ( some times opinionated ; but always intelligent engaging ) . while article typically draws more than single book , i like fact article typically written commentary around theme more than summary books under review .	1
i just received my first order , i love it ! this magazine covers broad range topics includes designer techniques , current trends , period styles so much more . it tons vibrant pictures illustrate articles . i think this magazine would ideal someone just starting out design gain basic understanding wide range topics , also experienced designer keep up current trends fill gaps knowledgeable tidbits	1
there seems great deal psuedo business magazines . i like business week hard hitting , features excellent articles . i always several articles week this publication worth my time read . many publications dummy down business make it too simple leaving out important details , nuiances important , just assume reader isn't intelligent . articles written concise , generally filled data support their conclusions . i found this magazine invaluable business school because it kept me up date , often ahead my classmates . business world i find this magazine one few keep me informed well rounded aspects business i am not familiar . i really feel this worthwhile publication if you looking stay top what current important business world .	1
before i begin , there one thing you need know : i can't cook . i skills can't beaten when it comes heating stuff microwave , i use toaster oven , uh , toast things , but that it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals me , which probably makes me only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say great deal just how entertaining every day rachael ray actually . course , you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would weird someone buy this magazine if they didn't cook they also hated rachael , i'm not weird ! however , although this ostensibly cooking-centric magazine , i'd argue it really reflects rachael attitude personality . her enthusiasm , love wide variety food , adventurous spirit shine through every page . all reports , rachael very hands-on developing this magazine , it shows . those who ask why they need read rachael ray magazine , since rachael all over television these days ( most recently her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew this : rachael isn't taking over world accident . she obviously doing something right dominating both food network daily schedule bestseller lists ( her ever-increasing line cookbooks ) . people just can't get their fill her ! so , what exactly her secret ? i think it boils down these factors : combination approachability charisma , which key ingredients superstardom ( think talented-yet-friendly stars such tom hanks or shakira ) . add dash optimism mixed spirit adventure , witnessed my favorite ray show , " $40 day , " which she explores new tourist destination each week , trying eat well insanely low budget . but what rachael ray magazine form , you're wondering ? well , my opinion , every day rachael ray appeals all tastes brilliantly translating her unique appeal tv screen printed page . i mentioned earlier , i probably won't cooking anything many recipes included each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes picture finished product , recipes lots variety creativity ... yum-o ! some so simple , like sandwiches or salads , i get feeling i might actually able attempt them if i really wanted ( see ? rachael " can-do " attitude even gets through kitchen-incompetent ! ) travel articles short pieces ( wide range topics such buying cheese , making mistakes kitchen , etc . ) also fun . but , rachael fan , i especially enjoy parts magazine written , or , rachael . one nice feature which readers send questions rachael which she personally answers . someone who participated lot " celebrity a " online past , i love these chances get know more someone famous who you may never meet person . fact , only reason i haven't rated every day rachael ray " five stars " because i'd like see even more rachael-related photos articles each issue ... how cool would ?! also , i'm hungry more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but fair , this relatively new magazine , all great magazines need time sort out what doesn't work . so far , every day rachael ray hit ground running off great start . i actually first person buy very first issue my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky happened there they set up display ) , i've looked forward each new issue ever since day . if you like rachael ray , you can't go wrong here ... start spending every day rachael ray " take bite outta life . " even if you can't boil water !	1

i'm one those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything , so it leap faith i bought natural health magazine without reading anything it . friend suggested it , since this particular friend never led me wrong before , i caved bought july/august 2005 copy immediately . let me start off saying i'm extremely picky person . i extremely high standards every purchase i make , i absolutely not cut manufacturer any slack if i find fault . now i've gotten out way , i mention i thoroughly impressed natural health . long ago , i subscribed new age magazine ( now known body soul , which i not care ) . it among my favorites solely due its wide variety content true-to-focus natural lifestyle tips advice . i cannot stand redundancy , incorrect information excessive advertising . i found natural health much more long lines former new age magazine , filled dozens little gems make it worth much more than $3.95 i paid . give you idea what magazine includes , here small sampling articles i found july/august issue : small articles include : - " bee or not bee " , breakdown aromatherapy ingredients include bee pollen , royal jelly , propolis , honey , stating just how effective natural these ingredients . - " how i get relief pms ? " experts ( including naturopath , gynecologist dietitian ) answer this question excellent responses . - " medicine cabinet : attack weekend warrior " natural remedies aids those like myself who love weekend warriors . - " clothes pose " great yoga gear ! - " medical breakthroughs " - " healing supplements : 8 ways beat anxiety " - " fitness fix - knee savers " longer articles include : - " healthy appetites : savvy strategies eating well " delicious , healthy recipes tips . - " good medicine : clean , healthy mouth " well-researched article " mercury fillings , fluoride toothpaste best at-home remedies " . - " five paths peace " five simple meditation techniques . - " eat beat heat : yin foods " more great recipes ! - " sacred spaces " - making your home your personal retrea t.t his only sampling ; fact , that less than half magazine alone . some articles fairly short , but provide just right amount information get point across . my personal favorite last page , " make one change " , where this month change " upgrade your z " . it included simple tips i able implement immediately . amount advertising seemed slightly less than usual ( probably same amount you'd find yoga journal , but not nearly many oprah magazine ) , they seemed line natural health focus . judging past reviews natural health , it seems magazine bad run 2003-2004 timeframe . let remember magazines change editors frequently . i found none past complaints true this issue , but may not so future issues years now . me , i want subscription asap	1

i discovered this " magazine " while employed reference instructional librarian culinary college . four annual hardcover issues arrive just one ad - back cover . recipe quantities typically family size rather than mass serving quantities . this important note because this magazine very much oriented towards professional or very advanced amateur chef . profiles articles tend focus needs professional . one patron ( local sous chef who graduated different culinary school some years earlier ) began swearing blue streak after thumbing through few issues . when i confronted him outburst , he apologized explained his behavior . three years , he worked under local chef amazed creativity chef coming up new recipes restaurant . after thumbing through issues , my patron realized ugly truth - their entire menu cribbed art culinaire . when i told him i my disposal large stack subscription forms , he immediately took one saying , " next time , i'll ahead him .

what bad : too many adds , however , there always typed letters top or bottom add whether it advertisement or part " real " muscle fitness magazine , so they easy scan , if you're not looking buy something . what good : just everything else . not every article exceptional , but i find there always least 2 or 3 articles just . just reading these athletes extraordinary life rewarding , information magazine genuinely beneficial . currently i am struggling take 6 meals day , every time i read article , this or bodybuilder tells me , he only started making serious gains when he got 6 meals day . so i keep my head down , try stick it , even when it hard . point , this magazine genuinely inspiring , information training ( go heavy maintain tension working muscle throughout motion + squeeze top ) nutrition ( eat many high-quality calories , lots protein ) always dead-on , when you read athletes personal life , there almost always something inspiring gain it ( magazine ' solid core values ' must when choosing athletes magazine ) . me , it perfect magazine , building muscle , doing so healthy fashion . i highly recommend picking up copy somewhere ( read past adds , some cleverly camouflaged ) see yourself . sincerely , jesper bech , denmark	1

i hope this magazine hasn't changed when i got it child 20 years or so ago , because i dearly loved it then . it not so much magazine , different articles recurring features , vividly illustrated report different group animals each month . ( i wore out binding my " alligators crocodiles " issue . ) beautiful drawings both fun look packed information -- when i taking biology courses college i realized my old zoobooks spreads , say , " all parrots world " given me intuitive grasp comparative adaptation without my realizing i learning anything . warned -- if you get this your child , you may listen all things she learned monkeys months time	1

this magazine doesn't come out regular basis like most mags ... so they don't need fill it up junk articles make it press . it explains how amazing things seen current films . often more explained picture than whole page words , so they quite few high quality pictures ... they also assume least little bit knowledge industry , so they don't explain easy stuff :) i think this most important , they treat productions objectivly ... no reviews , or off handed comments story line or acting ... if you want stuff buy premire ! i haven't yet found mag goes this depth films , without feeling like you getting sales pitch film company	1
